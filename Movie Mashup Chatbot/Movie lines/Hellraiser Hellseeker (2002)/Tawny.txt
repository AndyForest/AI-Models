WHAT?!
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Well now there's a compliment.
It's getting hot in here.
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Really?
You okay?
YOU!
You.
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
