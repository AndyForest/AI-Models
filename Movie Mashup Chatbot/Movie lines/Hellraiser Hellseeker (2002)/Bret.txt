I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Someone special.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
I quit. Today's my last day.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
GWEN?
Really? Do tell.
Yeah, how's that?
Getting paid for doing shit.
Must be nice.
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
