Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Good boy.  Where's is it?
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
What's wrong, Trev?
How do you think you got this job, cock?  Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
