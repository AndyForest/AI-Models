Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
I understand... I won't-
Sorry.
What was it?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
Well?
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
I did more then that.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Pitbull attacks.
Skin cancer.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
It's inside a moving car.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
The way you just looked at me...
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
Your insight is enlightening.
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Are you a dream too?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Bret... what the fuck...?
Yeah? You and who else?
So you're just packing it up just like that?
How much time off?
What's the occasion?
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Gwen.
I have my connections
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
What?
Since what?
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
Where's Allison?
I've been in here before.
Ambrose. I know.
What's that?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
You could say that.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
What's the difference?
I said she's been missing for-
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
What?
That was cold...
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
It's perfect.
You're alive...
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Really, why's that?
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Really? Why?
What?
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
In a word? Lucrative.
This isn't happening.
What?
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
But... I thought...
Eighty four.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Morgue...?
Thanks.
What?
Where is she? Where is my wife?
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
No please make yourself at home.
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
What evidence?
Where's my wife?
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
What do you want?!
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
I don't work here.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Two.
Ambulance.
What's under that sheet...?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
This game is over do you hear me?
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
Wait... what the hell is this...
I surrender...
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
It's not that kind of date.
Last week...
What do you mean?
-Tawny.
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
