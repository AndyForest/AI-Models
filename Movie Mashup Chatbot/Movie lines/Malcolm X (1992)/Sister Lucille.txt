Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
Yes sir.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
