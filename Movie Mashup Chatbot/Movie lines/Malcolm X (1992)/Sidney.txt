You're my father.
Let me die then.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Another one?
Please make way, please --
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
500.
