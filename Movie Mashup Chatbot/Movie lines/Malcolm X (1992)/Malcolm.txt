You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
Take it easy, baby.
Let Billie finish.
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
I'm wearing, Archie.
I'll give you back the 600.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
The bitch was there.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
You owe me six big ones.
Daddy, where's my money?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Nnnnnnn!
I'm working on it.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
Solid, daddy.
What?
Just now.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Lemme write it down for you.
Where can I get a hold of you?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
Man's rep travels.
Where I come from. Boston.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Keeps me out of the army.
I'm working trains. Selling.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
He had it coming.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
I want to. God knows I want to.
I don't know how.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I can't.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I can't.
I will do it.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I sure met some.
Then the devil is white.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
Little.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Where am I gonna start?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
I can't make out that shit.
Okay, okay. Show me, man.
What the hell for, man?
What for?
What? Everybody knows God is White.
Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
That's what Mama used to say.
What do you do with your time?
Okay, okay.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
Elijah who?
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
You ain't lying.
What did you give it to me for then?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
Man, what do you want?
Who the hell are you?
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
Do you?
What can I do for you?
Make it plain.
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.
Is the program ready?
Come, sit with us.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Betty it's me. It's me.
We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
You have to sleep for three.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
Talk about what?
I just want to sit here and be still.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
How do you know?
Why are you looking at me like that?
What do you think?
I'll be away a lot.
It will be rough.
It won't be easy.
I love you.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Did you hear what I said?
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
I'm in Detroit.
What have you set your mind to?
Are you?
How old are you, Betty?
Just an idle question.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
Let's talk about you for a change.
Delicious.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
What points?
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
What?
Is my family here yet?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
What did I tell you about assuming?
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Brother Earl.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Then we don't know that God was white.
What color were the original Hebrews?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Please, go ahead.
Yes, sir, I did.
Allah Akbar.
Let me do it then.
If you want to tell me.
Say what you're saying.
What?
Sure, man.
Is she hooking?
She know?
With him?
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
I say a lot of things.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
Let's go.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
I mean it's late, baby.
I better not come in.
Now you come back.
And don't come back.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
No. You'll be marked for death.
What does Sidney say?
What mission?
How long has this been going on?
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
How many you turning out?
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
What's your story, baby?
You better believe it.
You hear me, girl?
C'mere.
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
Yeah.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
That ain't bad.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
You're too small to be Bogart.
The hell you are.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Fine as May wine.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Well, all reet, then.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
Head nigger in charge?
You want to be the head man?
Might be all right.
So what about him?
What can you do?
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Allah will provide.
Are you sure?
He told you that?
