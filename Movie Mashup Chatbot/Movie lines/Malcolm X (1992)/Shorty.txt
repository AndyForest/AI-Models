Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
You the man!
Tell him about Baldy.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
I ain't doing bad.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
Eat lead, coppers.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
That's a fine chick.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Well, all right, then.
