She's right. They'll string her up.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
Turn it against her.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
She has hostages.
Yes.
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
Before you go...
Wait. Don't leave me.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
She'll forget about us eventually.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
But what if---it wasn't real?
You think so?
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
I'm not mad at you.
Hi.
That makes it worse.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Away. From you.
Like turning off a light.
I don't love you any more.
She said it wouldn't last.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Terrific.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
You're not afraid are you?
Let me kiss you.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
What do you feel about me?
You don't like me? You hate me?
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
Why not ?
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
Let's talk about us, not her.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Come on, let's ride.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Like it?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
This is my favourite place in the city.
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
When can I see, you again ?
Don't leave me.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
What's happening?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
I did.
I'll mention it upstairs.
A little.
Hmmm?
Why the empty cage?
Well...I guess I can't.
Supergirl?
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Yeah.
You vicious--
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
No!
I don't want your help.
Nurse! Help !
Nurse!
Nurse! Nurse!
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Why should I believe you?
I know it.
They think I have a concussion.
Oh no, not you again.
I'll drink to that.
Well, just one.
What is it?
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
Well, there's several ways to go .
