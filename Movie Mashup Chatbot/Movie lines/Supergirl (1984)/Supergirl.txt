Do you want to come to Argo City?
I'll come back as soon as I can.
How do I fight it?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
What?
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
I don't see why not.
And now?
Miss what?
It seemed that way to me.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
But I don't understand.
I sort of like what you said.
But why?
Just like that?
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Is this how?
Well...I guess one is all right.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
No.
What's that?
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
We're from different worlds.
We can't do that.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
Tell me where I can find her.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
We have to have a long talk about all this.
You love me?
Who didn't?
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
I have to.
Later.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
It's for your own protection.
That's home.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
For what?
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Cheap but effective.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
I don't scare that easily.
Who are you ?
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Zaltar!
Zaltar. Use the wand!
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Better than when I was a child.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
You're going to take me back?
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Then come with me.
Then teach me how.
Why?
I knew it!
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
Zaltar, please help me.
That horrible woman!
You look at them? How?
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
It's lovely. . .
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
Others?
I know.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
I was on Earth...
What is this place?
