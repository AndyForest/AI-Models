Yes.
Someone's chasing him.
Oh, no thanks.
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Theories?
Nice to meet you.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
He's nice.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Lucy; come back!
Why is he acting so strangely?
It doesn't seem right.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
No thanks. You go on.
It was just a trim.
But what for?
Must've been a defective puck.
She did that deliberately.
Thank you. You're very kind.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
I'd rather not talk about it.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
There isn't any.
I can do that.
Sure. Mate in five moves.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
I'd love to.
No, MR. Danvers.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
I'm Linda Lee.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
