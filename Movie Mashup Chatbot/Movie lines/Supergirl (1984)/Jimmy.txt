The scoop of the year!
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Can I give you a lift?
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Can I quote you?
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
Do you have any theories about last night?
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
Why didn't you tell me?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
Did anybody notice you?
How do you know?
Oh, sure.
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
