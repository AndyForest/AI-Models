What about my proposal?
Hey, where you going?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
