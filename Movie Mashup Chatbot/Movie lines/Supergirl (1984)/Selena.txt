What do you mean we?
At last. Ultimate Power.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
I don't feel like it right now.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
I think I'd better keep it.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Am I? Still?
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Why did she have to show up now?
No, a super girl.
It's what we were warned about.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
What does it mean?
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
What do you want?
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Guess! Go on.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
I could force you.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
And you think you're in love.
What an adorable hat.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
A passionfruit smoothee.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
I bet they do.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
Finished your estimate?
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
I've got things to do.
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Why George, are you proposing?
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Nonsense.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
You're wasting your breath.
Nigel, get lost.
Throw him out.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
Where is inner space?
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
What's it like?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
Not yet.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
A cheap trick.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
That was meant for me!
