The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
Goodbye...
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Yes, mustn't stop.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
You can use the wand.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
But it's impossible.
There is a way.
No, that's not true---there's well...no--
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
What? Palace? Hardly.
Criminals.
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Shouldnt've done that.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
