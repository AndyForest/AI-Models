Well thanks a pile, fella.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
Hey! Ethan!
You're supposed to guess.
You bet your ass.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I can't help it if men notice me.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
You sure?
Your hair looks the same.
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
How'd you do that?
She's a beast.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
You're not...an orphan are you?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
This is all your clothes?
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
