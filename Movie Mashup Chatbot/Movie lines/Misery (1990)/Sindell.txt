I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
Yes, he is.
Yes.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
I thought you were over it.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
Did they win?
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
You're still a writer.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
