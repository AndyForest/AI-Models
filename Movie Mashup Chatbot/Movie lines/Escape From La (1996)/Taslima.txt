Run, Snake...They're coming.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
The freeway.
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
Snake - what is it?
Sewers. Come on.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
You need help.
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
