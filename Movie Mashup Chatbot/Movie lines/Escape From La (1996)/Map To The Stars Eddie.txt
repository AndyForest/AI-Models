Cuervo, look out behind you!
He's... near.
It's so good to see you again.
Oh Cuervo...
I thought he was, but he came back.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
I don't know about this thing.
Aw, come on, Snake.
Me too?
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Right over there.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
No way.
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
