Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Go on now. Do as I say.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Where's Plissken?
What?
Where?
You told me he was dead.
Give it.
Give it to me.
Where is he?
We'll see.
