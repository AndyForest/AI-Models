No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
I don't know yet.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
Say goodnight, Carjack.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
I'm already dead.
I got a new deal for you.
Don't lie to me.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
I need a favor.
The name's Plissken.
Got a smoke?
Yeah, I got it.
It's history. I gotta go.
I'm here.
75% power.
Locked.
She's in the green.
Good.
Not you?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Where do I put ashore?
So what does this thing do?
Defense against what?
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Call me Snake.
Get this crap out of me.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
What's the little black box do?
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Is that what I think it is?
If he lets you get close enough.
Yeah, kinda.
Don't like it, don't come.
Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
We'll see.
How do you know all this?
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Later.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Not yet.
Where are they going?
Where is it?
I said pull over.
Stop the damn car.
Delgado?
Location.
Where are they?
Where'd they go?
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Which way?
Looking to get out.
Who?
Where?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Who?
Find Cuervo Jones.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
What the hell is this?
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
How do we get out of here?
The what?
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
Like hell I do.
Don't follow me.
Who?
No screamin' shit.
What are they?
Are you crazy?
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
Well, I'll think it over.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Yeah.
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
I'm looking for somebody.
