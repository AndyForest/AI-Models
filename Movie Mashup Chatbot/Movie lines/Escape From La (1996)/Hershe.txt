My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Can you land?
Somebody get off!
See you in hell, Snake.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
Dream on, blue eye.
I see your point. What's the favor?
All right, so I made another deal.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
Not anymore.
What's in it for me?
