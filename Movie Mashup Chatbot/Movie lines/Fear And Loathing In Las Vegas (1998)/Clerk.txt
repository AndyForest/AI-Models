What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Killed?
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Let's have lunch!
There's no hurry! The race is over!
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
