Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
You'd pay me for that?
No! I swear I'm not!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!

Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Part of what?
I don't know what you're talking about!
