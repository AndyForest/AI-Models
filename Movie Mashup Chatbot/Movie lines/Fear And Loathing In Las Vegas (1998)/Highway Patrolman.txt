Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
That's a strange attitude.
You realize...
Could I have that, please?
May I see your license.
