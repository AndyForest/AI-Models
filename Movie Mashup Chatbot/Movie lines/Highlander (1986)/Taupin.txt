It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
Not power.  Not control.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Get out.
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
All of it finished.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
Come here, Brenna.
I haven't killed _you_.
There are differences.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
Not the same.
I didn't kill the watchman.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
He is older than I.
Yes.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
That would be difficult to explain.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
I see.
Why are you here?
You won't.
A factor of age.
At least.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
Yes.
Yes.
Follow me.
A little dusty.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
Maybe it would do us both good.
They do it each year.
Yes.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
I wish I could.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
Not all of them.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
You are.  Now.
You've been listening to rumors.
You're a fool.
You had to do _nothing_!
No one knows you're here?
He sees me as a threat.
Go home.
You are being foolish.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
Have you gone to the police?
You?
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
That bothers you?
Not your concern.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
Where?
Tradition.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
You have an active imagination.
I don't know what you're talking about.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
Probably.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Basil the II.
Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
It's not mine.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Yes.
Yes, he was.
My father taught me.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
_Answer_ me.
He knows I'm here.  How?
And the Bulgarian?
How many came?
What name is he using?
Where!
You're wrong.
I've had a few more concerns.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
You're insane.
You were never a kid.
I haven't drunk this much since-
He found us even there.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
It's good to see you, Kahn.
And have you something to settle with me?
What are you doing here?
How did you find me?
How are you?
Sit.
Kahn?
Leave her alone.
Go to hell.
Tradition.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
What's the point?
Leave her out of this.
Run!
Of sorts.
You've been here from the start.
Not so long.
Should I care?
And if I refuse?
Are you here?
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
Do you?
He's mistaken.
Home.
My condolences.
A mystery.
Your murder weapon?
I presume it's a sword.
That's none of your business.
What are you getting at?
American.
It doesn't.
No.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Yes.
Nothing to be sorry about.
I'm sure that's true.
No.
Same.
When may I expect the cleaners?
We were very close.
His only kid.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
