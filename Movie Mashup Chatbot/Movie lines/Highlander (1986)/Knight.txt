Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Finish your prayers?
Romirez is dust.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
It's all we have.
State of grace and all that.
Certainly not me.
Get up.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
It's all we have.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
This isn't done.  Get up.
As you wish.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
MACLEOD!
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
Friend of yours?
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Long time.
