Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
You'd think he'd had practice.
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Figure she's with him?
