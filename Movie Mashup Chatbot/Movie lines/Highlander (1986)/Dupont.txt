So sure?
Finish yours?
Romirez understood.  Not you.
You're wrong.
No doubt.
Not so scared.
Tradition.
Who am I deceiving?
Not likely.
We need more time.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
I had no choice.
Either you are with me or against me.
Do not turn your back on me.
Don't threaten me, Private.
We must talk.
It can be different.  It must be.
Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Equals?
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
What is your position?
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
Your name?
