Go to hell.
Sure.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Yeah.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
It's in good condition.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
Claymore.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Fine.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Thanks.
It's my birthday.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
Would you remember his name?
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
The boy _died_?
I don't follow you.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Why?
No thank you, I'm fine.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Yes.
You have lived forever.
The inheritance.
No!
What is it?
What's wrong?
Will I see you again?
What is it you want?
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it like?  Being you?
Damn you.
Don't.
Is that a threat?
You kill with your left hand?
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
What about that family in '31?
You killed those other two.
Of bodies.
That's insane.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
He knows about you.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
I'd like you to try.
Who are you?
Just a little crazy.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
I'm not even sure why.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
I hope I never get that old.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
That's impossible.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
You're using your son's name.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
It's beautiful.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
Yes.
You want me to front for you.
You make it all sound so simple.
When you finish, what then?
You did kill those men.
What's all that?
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Is this what you killed them with?
Maybe.
You're wrong.
No.  I had to talk to you.
No.
Are you?
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
I'd rather hear yours.
No.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
What about me?
He was innocent.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
He called you "MacLeod".
What will you do now?
And you?
Who is he?
Dupont Circle.
He tried to kill me last night.
What the hell is going on?
Why not?
Jesus Christ.
I have friends.
I've been to Church Hill.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
Does Carl Smith?
Who?
Grave robbers?
Someone beat you.
Good reflexes.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Byzantine?
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Very traditional.
Do you play?
Thanks.
Now there's a new topic.
I'm just curious.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
What's all of this got to do with me?
What makes you so sure he's the one?
You're an asshole, Moran.
It'll never stick.
What are you getting at, Moran?
Spare me the details.
Four?
We've got nothing to say.
I'm calling an attorney.
What do you want from me?
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
Who is it?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
Yeah.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
All I need is for you to check the name.
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.
I don't believe him.
