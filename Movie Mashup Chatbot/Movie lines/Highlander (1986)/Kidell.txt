Carl Smith.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
No.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
He was unsual.
Would you like more tea?
