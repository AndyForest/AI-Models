You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You're serious?
What...?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I'm through, Xander.
