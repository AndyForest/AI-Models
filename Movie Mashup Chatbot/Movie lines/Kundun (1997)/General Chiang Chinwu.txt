Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
I have a copy for you.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Dalai Lama.
