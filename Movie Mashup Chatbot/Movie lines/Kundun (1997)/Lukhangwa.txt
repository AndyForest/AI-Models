Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
Are you, General?
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
