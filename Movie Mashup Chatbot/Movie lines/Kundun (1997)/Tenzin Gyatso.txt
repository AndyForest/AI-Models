I worry about them.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Where are you from?
All quiet?
Yes. I am ready.
A moment.
No!
Can I free the prisoners?
Here. We'll collect them.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
And you have horses? You love horses.
But, I am in charge.
Can I do anything I want?
It is alright, Father.
Soon.
I have.
Thank you. Please sit.
General Chiang.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Then, we shall meet.
Yes.
Yes, but they say he did.
Time to study.
He is a capable man.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
With much bloodshed.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
And the United Nations? Surely?
All?
Did you receive the letter?
The Sera monks have surrendered?
I need to squeeze this brain.
The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
I am him.
Do you have money?
Do I have money?
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
I will not go.
The people will not allow it.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
I had relinquished doubt.
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
I am scared.
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
Where is that?
Has anyone died?
What is the size of our army, now?
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
And, America?
Britain?
Can India help us?
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
What can I do? I am only a boy.
Look here!
Tell me.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Where is Alsace?
Will we ever be in war?
Will we be in this war?
The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
Is that big?
How big is Tibet's army?
Please.
Always.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
I leave tomorrow.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
Do you think I must?
You will always!
But you will always be here?
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
You decide.
What do you think?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
We have.
I will miss you.
Am I running away?
You will not come?
But, I have no experience.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
This is Tibet. And this is China.
Where is Poland?
This is Britain.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
The Chinese.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
I want to go down there.
Pretend.
Is that true or pretend?
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
I have more men.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
How could I ever leave?
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
We cannot.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
You, kill me?
Tell me.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
You are unharmed?
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
Like my mother.
Much too young.
No.
Does he treat you fairly?
Hmm.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
