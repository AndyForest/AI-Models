Shut the heck up... Pop.
Who's my real father, man?
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Yeah, go on...
So, did you find my dad?
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
I tried to help you...!
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
I'm sorry...
You need it.
I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Who cares?  I got a case.
Ouch.
Forget it.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
Gut feeling.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
