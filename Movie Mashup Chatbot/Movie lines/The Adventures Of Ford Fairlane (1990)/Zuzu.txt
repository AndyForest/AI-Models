Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
There's that question...
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
Ick.
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
This way...
Nice left you got there, jerk.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Ford, you were right!
This is boring, guys.
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Who cares about people?
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
What a perv...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Spunk, come back...
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
Why are all these people after me?
Peachy.
Hello?
It's red, Ford.
Fluck you!
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
