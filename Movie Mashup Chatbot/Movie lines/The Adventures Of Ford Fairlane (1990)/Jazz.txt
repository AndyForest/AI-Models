Wha --
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Johnny's C.D.?
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
You're not funny.
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
I came to warn you...
Hello, Ford...
Ah, an obvious choice.
Who?
You okay?
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Contacts.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Make eye contact when you say that.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Spooky.  I'll process her.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
So what about this watch?
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
You're saying you need money.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
You wish.
Exactly.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
