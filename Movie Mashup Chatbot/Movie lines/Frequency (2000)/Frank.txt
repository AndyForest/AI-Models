How do we get to the vault door?
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
You're shitting me!
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Elvis has left the building.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
One way to find out.
It looks open on the other side.
I'm alright, Gibby.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Hey, bud.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
I'm serious.
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
Wish you weren't.
He ain't the only one.
I love you, Bud.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
Sure.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Did he?
The usual.
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
You alright?
How about a little of the King?
Hey, bud.
Next time lets put some money on it.
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
I swear, Satch.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
No.  This isn't what you think.
What do you mean?
About what?
No, I don't.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Luck, my ass.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
I'm right here behind you...
You ready?
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Okay, start pedaling.
Glad to hear that.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
What's wrong?
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
John, you there?
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
Hang on.
Huh?
I got it.
Okay, okay...
What...
How the hell am I gonna do that?
What?
In my pocket.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
John, he's got my driver's license.
Johnny, I know, but...
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
You all right?
John, you still there?
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
Hang on a sec, John.
Wow.
Yeah, you betcha.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
What are we like in...1998?
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
How?
Got it.
Whatta we do now?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
I'll be damned.
What do I tell them?
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
I'll warn them.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
What are you talking about?
Whatta you mean...
What kinda twisted animal.
Murdered?  Why?
Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
When?
She just died, your mother just died?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
What?  What is it?
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
Are you alright"?
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
I'm glad.
Tell me.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Chief?!  Is that you?
I don't understand.
But that's tomorrow.
When?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
On the job?
Why?
What?
What are you talking about?
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
I think I'm losing you.
You're still my Little Chief, right?
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
It's really you, isn't it?
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
You sound...ground up...?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
How could this be happening?
Johnny...?
That's impossible.
What's happening?
What?
Nothing...I just spilled something.
I'm not dreaming.
What the hell...
29 years...?
What?
W...B...2...YXB.
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Uh huh...
Oh, that was my kid.
Sorry 'bout that.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball.
What?
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
Where are you transmitting from?
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
