Get him home safe.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Deleon.
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Frank, this is insane...
Frank, please...
How's that?
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Uh, huh.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
Do you know where I found this?
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
I think you know, Frank.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Frank, we need to talk...
Hello, Frank.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
He ain't our guy, John.
Got a minute?
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Uh, huh.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
She makes ten.
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
You're not looking too good.
Nothing you're willing to do.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
