You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
I better give you my address then.
How'd you know my name, mister?
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
Huh?
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Huh?
What?
John.  John, you all right?
How you feeling?
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Go in where?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Sull!  What the hell!
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Sully!  Is that you?
