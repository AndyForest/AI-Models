Frank...
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
The future guy?
So am I.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
I know.  He loves that thing.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
Okay...
Do you know how much I love you?
I'm off.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I love you more.
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
You give him his drops?
Where's Johnny?
Frank...what's wrong?
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
He did.
Butch called.
How was your tour?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
I think I ruined the sauce...again.
Damn.
Well, why not a little of the King?
Hey, bud.
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Are you a good cop, John?
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
You work too hard, John.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Close.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
