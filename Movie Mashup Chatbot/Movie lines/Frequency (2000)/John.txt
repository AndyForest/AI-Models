Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
Well, I think you do.
You know what I'm saying.
You remember Mary Finelli?
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
Dad, you there?
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Please, Dad, just do it.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
He took your wallet?
What?
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
No.
It's not your fault, Dad.
Yeah, I think so...
I'm right here, Dad.
H-hi.
You there?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
You really wanna know?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
October 22, 1969.
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
She's not here.
It's Mom.
Something happened, something...
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
What it was like when you died in the fire...
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
Yeah, it's me.
Dad...?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
October 12, 1969.
It did, Pop.  It did.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
Fire.
I never knew you, Dad.
I lost you.
But you're not...you're not still here.
No wait, don't go!
What's that?
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
Nah, I gave it up.
No, not yet.
Yeah...I think so.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
1998.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
Sun spot?
I don't know.
Dad...?
What if it's not...
You just burned the desk.
Oh my god.
What's going on?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
29-years ago.
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
What'd you say your name was?
You call your son Little Chief?
What'd you just say?
This afternoon?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Huh?
Hello?
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Queens, New York.
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Name's John.
Uh, hello?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Gordo?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
My father didn't die in a fire?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Longbranch...?
Better.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
What the hell is that smell?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Yeah.  Sure.
What?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
Which means he probably knew her.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
Yeah.  That's it.
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Whoa, I just...I just...
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
I try to be.
She's pretty special.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Yeah, that's right.
Look who's talking.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
So how'd you like LION KING?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
So how are things at the hospital?
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Sounds good.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
You have the right to speak to an att --
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
Nah, just working the job.
The 2-3.  Homicide.
I look familiar?
You used to be on the job?
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
Wife around?
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
