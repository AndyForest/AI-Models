I'll go find Hayes.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
They around?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
Fuck you, asshole.
Sullivan?
Who the fuck is this?
Hell-
Who are you?
Huh.
No kiddin'?
I hear that.
A hot shot, huh?
No.  What house you work?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
