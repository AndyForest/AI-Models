Hey.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Really?
So, how was the ride, kids?
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
Come on man.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Okay.
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
Taking care of business.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Yeah?
I'm not a nice guy.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
It's a mistake to think that.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
What was your name again?
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
Oh, yeah?
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Military marching bands.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Mm.
What'd he get you?
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
He is.
He is?
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
You rich?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Hi.
Yeah, totally.  So, uh, what do they interview you about?
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
Come on!
Jeff! Come up here!
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
Jeff, stay there.
No.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
This is my home.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
You don't know?
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Oh, shit.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Wow. You did that for me?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
I hit her.
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
That chick, Erica?
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Good. That's good.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
Ask your girlfriend.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
Who were you talking to?
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
No, this has everything to do with you.
I hope you're happy!
Ready?
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Camel jockey.
Well, what about this?
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Your manager?
Yeah?
What are you going to do? Hm?
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
It's none of my business?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
About what?
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Where do you get your ideas?
I'm here.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Yeah.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Oh that's nice for you.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
