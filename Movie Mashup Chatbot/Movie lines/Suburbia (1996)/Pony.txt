I'll be in the car, okay?
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Wait, I'll get you some air.
You okay, man? You okay?
Yeah!
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Yeah!
You could do it.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
You make videos?
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
Hey, thanks, man.
No, no, whoa!
Don't drop the guitar, man.
I just started it.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Oh, you were there?
Erica, you coming?
Thank you.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
Um, mother-daughter.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Funny shit, man.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
We were?
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Oh, sure.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Hey, where's Erica?
Burnfield. No place like it.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Oh, yeah.
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
You know what I'm saying?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
What?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
What do you mean?
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
Well, not exactly.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
Yeah.
Yeah, really.
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Like songs?
What?
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
So how's college?
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Yeah, good.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Nobody's fucking anybody!
I think I gotta go.
Really? What else does your mother say?
Yeah?
Is that Jeff?
You do?
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
That's because I am.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Yep.
Mm-hm.
If...
I can't believe you're still here.
You done?
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
Mine too.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
Alright, alright already.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
I'm always serious.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Hey.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
New York, huh?
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
Yeah.
It's pretty exciting.
Oh, yeah?
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Look at you!
It's stupid.
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Hey!
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
If you hit me...
Don't do that.
Yeah.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Don't do that, man, okay?
Whatever.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Oh, How'd she get back?
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Tim?
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
