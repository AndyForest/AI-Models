It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
You better! Yes!
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
I'm so burnt-out.
Alright, Pony!
Buff is funny. God.
In what way?
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
Am I fucking him?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Oh, you were in the band?
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
I know. It's okay.
That's what I mean.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Deep down. Way down.
Erica.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
Let's see.
You cut off your little finger?
Mm.
Really?
Mm-mm.
I'd like to.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Yeah. So, what about you?
A Porsche.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
He is.
Yes.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
No, not really. Middle-class.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
Hi.
It's nice here. It's different.
Mm-mm.
It's coming along.
It does look good.
Pony and I are friends.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Hi.
I'd love to read that.
Mm.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Oh, wow.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
