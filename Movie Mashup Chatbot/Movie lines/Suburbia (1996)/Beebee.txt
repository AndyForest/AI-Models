Mm-hm.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Yeah.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Intense.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Yeah.
Knock yourself out.
I don't anymore.
Um-hm.
Mn-hm.
We are?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
You didn't get me in trouble.
Uh, home, you know.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Responsibility, progress.
Uh-huh.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Slides go with it.
Yeah!
That was really great.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Right now?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Oh.
A cloud?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
What's it about?
Hey, you said you did a video?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Yeah, when's he coming?
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
