Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Typical male.
Yes.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
What did you guys think?
Was it okay?
Really?
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Come on.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Jeff! Let's go!
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
You really suck, you know that?
What?
'Bye, Jeff.
You did, huh? Good for you.
You're unbelievable.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
I've run out of words.
Shit, Jeff!
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
For a ride.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Is that a threat?
God, you smell like whiskey.
Mm.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hm.
What?
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Come on.
Jeff!
You do.
Yes, you do.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Mm.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
My goal is to make art.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
New ground?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
So what do you wanna do?
Come with me.
Of course.
What feelings?
What?
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Jeff. Jeff.
How?
Okay, what would you have done.
Oh, yeah?
It got that close.
It was a racial incident.
This is ridiculous!
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
Um, because you didn't want to go.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Typical male.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
What? What do you stand for?
But do you stand for anything?
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
I'm talking about idealism.
Your completely missing the point.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Of course I do!
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
About things that are important to me.
Yes, you asshole.
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
So you can give me more shit?
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
It's a piece.
Man?
No.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
I hate that.
You could've come over.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
You know, my mom has this saying.
Oh, my god!
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Me?
Yeah.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
What's that supposed to mean?
Soon.
No, I'm going.
I'm moving.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Jesus, Jeff.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
That was so great!
Alright!
Yeah, come on, play it.
Yeah.
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
Yeah?
Would I get paid?
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
You're not serious.
You do not want me to do your cover.
Yeah?
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
You do not!
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
No, she was just sitting there?!
Like?
Yeah?
So? What's L.A. like?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Oh!
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Is that your driver?
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Pony, oh my god!
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
Could you give me a ride?
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Jeff!
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Come on, Jeff.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Hey, Tim.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Fuck.
The fuck not?
I'm going out later.
