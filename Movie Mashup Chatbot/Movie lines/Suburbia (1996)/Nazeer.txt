Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
You're a drunk and an idiot.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
It's okay.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Please!
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
This is private property, my friend.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
He's drunk.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Two-fifty.
Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Look, look, just get off my property.
Nazeer Chaudry!
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Look, why do you care, huh?
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
Look, your trespassing.
Seven-twenty.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
What are you saying?
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
Get off my roof!
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Look Pakeesa...
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Get off my property!
Look, get down off my property.
Please. Look...
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
