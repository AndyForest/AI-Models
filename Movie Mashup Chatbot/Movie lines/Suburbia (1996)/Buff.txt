Okay, whatever you want.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Yeah.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Sounds like a bummer.
Any gunshot victims?
Your a nurse?
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
A cloud.
It's really not about anything.
Yup.
No I quit.
Hey!
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Yeah, man.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Bullshit.
Tim...
She's dead?
What?
What she doin' in the van, man?
Hey, man.
What?
Wait. Hey, man.
Y- s-sure it did.
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
I know, man.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Yeah.
Hey, you know me.
Sure.
Good.
No. Life is too short.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
In the limo!!!
Fuck it!
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Go!
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
A long, long, long...
A long, long, long, long, while.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Ah!
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
Sorry.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
That's the rock star thing.
The dude wants it.
Yes!
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
It's your birthday?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Stuck with what guy?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Where are you-hoo?
And your mom.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Play it! Come on!
Yeah.
Yeah, right, publicist.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Ah, you know people there?
Hey, man.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Great.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
I will.
I can come visit?
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Yeah?
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Hey! Hey.
Yes! Free concert!
Buff.
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
So, then, you're, like, available?
Shit.
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Mm. And your like, what else?
Your his publicist?
Yeah.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Good. See you later.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Glad it's okay.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
It's safe, come on.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
He paid you man.
Score! Yeah!
Thanks, man!
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
A reel?
Yes!
Yeah.
I could.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Thanks. See man?
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Whoa!
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Please.
Well, play it, man.
Yeah, we're all above that.
Oh, So what about her?
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
No, but I heard it was great.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
