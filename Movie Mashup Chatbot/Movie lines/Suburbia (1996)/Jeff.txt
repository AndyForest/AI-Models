You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
It was pretty bad, huh?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
How long were you in there?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
In Group?
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Can I have some?
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
I don't know.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
No.
Guess not.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
No, no, no.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
She's dead.
Buff...
She's in the van.
Look.
Erica is in the van back there.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
What, they're looking for her?
You know?
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
No.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
No, no.
Uh, last night...
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
No, I mean, no one.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
No, I'm not worried.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No.
No, no.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
So you can do an album cover?
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Watch out for that tree.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
That sounds so depressing.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
I'd get bored.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
No, he's not with a girl.
Jesus Christ.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
No, no.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
Don't let 'em fight.
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Yeah.
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
What?
Shut up! Aw...
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Is that Bee-Bee?
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
That, that's Indian?
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Just put it down.
Will you just put the gun down?
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Just go home, alright?
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
No.
No.
I don't know.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Why? Because I give a shit?
Yes.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
You lied to me.
They let you out?
Oh fuck.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
What'd you do?
Well, w-what happened?
What? What'd you do?
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Yeah, fuck 'em.
What?
No.
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
See ya later.
Tim, what are you talking about?
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Sooze wants to see him.
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
Nobody. Sooze.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Because I'm alienated.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Please?
Nazeer what?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
That's right.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
I don't know.
Why we're just standing here.
I gave it to you.
What?
Just go.
Just go.
Go.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Oh, fuck it, man!
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Well, what about us?
Wait. What, what are you saying?
To his hotel?
Wait, away?
Where are you going?
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
I, yeah.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
No. No, no, no.
So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
No, I don't.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
I don't know.
No, no.
Mm-mm.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Mm-hm.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Nothing.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
And?
Us.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Sooze.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
I would've stopped it.
Yeah.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Tim!
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Can I talk?
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Yes, I stand for -
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
Hey!
One!
Name one.
Like what?
About what?
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Your sure as hell right about that.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Yes.
Was that supposed to be me?
Okay, so maybe later.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Oh! Trim it!
I know, I know, I know.
God, I haven't seen you all day.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
Of course it does.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
So who are you?
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
For a while.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Great.
Now?
Really?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
So you think I should?
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
Sorry.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
The prom. That's funny.
Yeah, I crash there.
Yeah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
No, it's not...
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Good, man.
Hey, Pony.
