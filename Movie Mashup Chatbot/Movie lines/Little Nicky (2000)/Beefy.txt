That turn you on there, RuPaul?
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
No.
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
I think you're looking at him.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Put it in your mouth.
That pain is hunger.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
Makin' friends already.
It's not me, moron.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
