Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
Boogerland!
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
