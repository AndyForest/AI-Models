What's Nicky doing down there?
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Oh, would you grow up.
No.

Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
A black guy?

Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
