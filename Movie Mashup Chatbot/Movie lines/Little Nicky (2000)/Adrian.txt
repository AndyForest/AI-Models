Absolutely not.
Is this a joke?
Little Nicky.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
He's sick?
You shouldn't have come here.
No!
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Hello, Cassius.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
It's our time, brother.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
We could create our own hell there.
What do you think about... Earth?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
And he's dead serious.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I'm calling you out, brother...
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Sure, why not?
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
