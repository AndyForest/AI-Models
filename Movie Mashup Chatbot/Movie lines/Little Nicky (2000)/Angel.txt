I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
I'll call her later.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
You're already there...
It would be so okay.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Yeah, you do...
She's so nice.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Angels don't get any older, son.
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Try an angel.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Maybe try the opposite of that.
