Now will you get in the flask?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Let her go.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Please, get out of my mind!
ADRIAN!
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
What is it?
A speech impediment?
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Valerie's crying!
How did you see me?
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Where did you meet my father?
How come you're not older?
Wow. What... what did she look like?
An angel?
My mom wasn't a goat?
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
This is baloney!
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
I didn't murder anybody
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Release the evil?
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
What can I do about it?
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Well, let's rock and roll.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
So far, so good. Now what?
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Oh. Sorry.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
No. This can't be happening.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
So go get 'em, Dad!
How bad?
You're a good devil, Dad.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Definitely.
I mean... tough break.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Beast.
You got it.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
That's a pretty brassiere.
Coulda been much worse.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
You're not saying it's up to me?
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
Hey...
See ya, fellas.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Which way did he go?
I'll just go to Heaven.
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
Good idea... kill me.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
All right...
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
Adrian?
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
You smell like coconuts.
I love you.
Do me.
From my dad's side of the family.
That was Cassius!
I have to, Valerie.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
East Rutherford.
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
I think I'm floating.
No.
Valerie?
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Hey.
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Good. I was concerned.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
School?
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
It's freezing my hands.
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
The South.
You think I'm a tourist?
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
That just hurt a lot.
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
If it's Cassius, yes.
It looks like the work of a brother...
I don't know.
Yeah. The deep South.
No.
Off limits.
Yes. What is rent?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
I don't know?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Yes. I would like my flask back.
Hey...
