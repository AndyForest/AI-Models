Weird shit...?
Yeah...?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Go!! Just go!!
The kid's with them!!
Depends.  You got a memo?
Can we get this car there?
Is there a switch?
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
A mistake.
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
You feel anything?
Its muscles are locked.
Wait a minute-
Just do it!
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
What?
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
Any luck?
You got a better way up?
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
20 minutes.  Susan?
We'll be back at the platform in...
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
The Department of Public Health...
Look, I showed you my badge...
We can do it!
Talk to me.
C'mon...
I can.  We can do this...
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Jump in.
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
Try not to sweat?
That's why we should do it now.
It worked before...
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
What-
Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
It's no use! They know we're in here!
How?!
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
Toss the flare down!
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
No.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Susan, we're not b-
Oh, no, you were-
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Great crowd.
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
Honey, just leave it.
So?
Maybe they lied to you.
We?
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Thought it was my week for that.
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
Don't get kinky here...
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
You did!
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
