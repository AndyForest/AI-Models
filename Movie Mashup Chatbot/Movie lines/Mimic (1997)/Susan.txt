Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
What's your name?
We're no leaving you!
Which way?
What?
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
But the power...
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Manny...
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
No...
Just inner chambers...
No...
Peter...
Ah...
Your arm, you can't...
Oh, come on, come on!
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
The scent won't last...
Peter-
Just do it!!
Rub it on the windows!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
That's camouflage...
No, Jesus, no.
Don't.
It's me. Can you hear me?
It didn't bite me.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
I was just late.
Right.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
No such thing, baby.
He was just doing his job.
I heard how you talked to him.
No, there's...
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
I'll be late.
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
You know what I mean...
Do you think we did the right thing?
Please.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
You sure you didn't see one of these?
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Hello.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
My God.
And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
This wing configuration. I've never...
It bit you.
I have no idea.  Are you ready?
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
What's this?
Oh, Jesus.
What?
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
