I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
Boyfriend?
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
I had to see you...
What a break...
Were you asleep?
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Were you asleep?
So long.
I should've danced with you.
Okay to say something now?
Cute.
The two might go together.
That seems like a good choice.
How you doing?
Hello.
I'll take you... why not?
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
This one has a special meaning.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
It was a mistake.
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
It's one idea...
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
You don't owe me that.
Never.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
One baked -- one fries.
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
Can we order first?
Okay.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
Dancing?
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Nonsense!
Welcome.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
I was going to do that for you.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Are you still coming?
Is there another way to see it?
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
What's that got to do with it?
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
You take off when you have to.
Two days.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
I want you to go on this trip.
Now I want you to do something for me.
Nice of you... thank you.
Lovely.
No... no thank you notes.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
What's this?
So you'll be at work?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
What needs clearing up?
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
Note. Put it in the note.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Carol the waitress?
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
How ya doing?
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
What about your mother?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
What's with the dark?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
How old are you?
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Okay.
His name?
No.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
I see the help -- judgement call.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
I've got Jews at my table.
I'm starving.
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
What are you trying to do to me?
No. No. Get Carol.
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
You changed the room around...
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
Help!
Last word freak.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Think white and get serious.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
About a dog.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
Okay by me.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
He's a pain in the ass.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
Wait here.
What?
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
Sure thing.
Absolutely.
Is he dead yet?
Ask him.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
I forgot to lock the door.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Absolutely not.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
You going to come talk to me or not?
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I think you gotta camp it here...
I told you to go on in.
Does it matter?
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
This stuff is pointless.
Never a break. Never.
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
Yeah...
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
I brought you Chinese soup.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Yo, yo, yo...
Now we'll both call him.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me...  it's not affection. It's a trick.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Where are all your queer party friends?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
It smells like shit in here?
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Okay, then.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Do you realize that I work at him?
Well, that's a load off.
Yeeeess!!!
'Love was... '
How're you doing?
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
What's he look like?
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
What's it mean?
