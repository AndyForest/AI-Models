Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
I love you.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
What is it you want? What?
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
Huh?
Do you love me?
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Don't be silly. How bad?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
No.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
His home number.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
No.
Emergency room only.
Yes.
Since forever.
I'm a waitress.
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
You know what? I...
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Okay.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Because...
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
I wasn't asleep!!
What are you doing here?
What job?
Grouchy?
What do you want?
What do you want, Melvin?
Okay. Good-bye.
Go ahead.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
I can trust my brain.
Yeah... Well...
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
I'll take a bus.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
I don't.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
To hell with sex.
I'll never forget you said it.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
Sex with Simon?
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
Here's the trouble with never.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Fries.
And mean it...
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
And?
You wanna dance?
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Stop asking everyone.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
No.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
Hey -- you let him...
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
Thanks, Melvin.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
Hi.
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Yes.
Hello?
No.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
My son.
I can't. I work.
The stiff one eye?
No, sir...
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
Thank you.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
What you did changed my life.
Okay.
So. Anything else?
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Getting loud, getting loud.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Yes.
Just how grateful I am.
I'm not kidding.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
Why did yo do this for me?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
Yes.
Uh, Udall?
No!!! Stay away from me!
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
How do you know about my mother?
My son is sick, okay?
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
What are you doing here?
You all set here?
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Oh, please...
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Sorry.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
So what are you doing with a dog?
Spence.
Spencer.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
What do you care?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Okay.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
I know. He's just the best.
Will you please take it?
Don't want to. I love you.
One night with me!
But what about...
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
All right, cut me a break.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
Stop staring. Do a vase.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
Good night.
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
I'm sorry... are you okay?
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
What a nice compliment.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
Yes. I really would.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
