I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Hey -- you called me... I...
What?
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
She's nice.
Do it.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
How's Verdell doing?
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
Thanks for looking after him.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
