I love you...  Let him take you home.
You think you're kidding.
I'll take care of myself --
I just love her.  How're you doing?
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
I've got to sketch you.
Good night.
How to die, mostly.
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Uh-huh...
No!!!
Can you not be violent?
Was this supposed to be your room?
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Well...
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
So am I, Frank.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
Well, I can't reach them.
Terrify me?
Sorry. What are those cards?
No. Please, don't force him.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
What's wrong?
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
But you know where you're lucky?
Picking on me won't help.
Did you like it that much?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Because...  ... you love her?
What did she say?
I'm coming.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
I love you.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
What are you talking about?
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
Another place where?
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
I'm going back with you.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
You consider your life easy.
Melvin...
Not it at all, really.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
That's very thoughtful.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Got any easier questions?
Thanks.
Would you leave now, please?
Come on, sweetheart...
Oh, my gosh.
Get out.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Get out.
Please, just leave.
Go away.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
Thank you for walking him.
Verdell?
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
No, I didn't.
Did you... do something to him?
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Maybe this can wait.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Which color was that?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Why are you doing this?
Just a second -- he has to go.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
