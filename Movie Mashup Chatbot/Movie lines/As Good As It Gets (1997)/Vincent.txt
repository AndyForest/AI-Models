No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Please!! NO!!!
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
So you're practically finished, huh?
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
