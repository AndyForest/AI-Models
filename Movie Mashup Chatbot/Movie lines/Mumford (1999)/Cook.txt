Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Were you supposed to have a session?
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Could you come with me please?
Dr. Mumford.
