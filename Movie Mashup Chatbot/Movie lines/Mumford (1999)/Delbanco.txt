Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
...And I from Phyllis.
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
I think he's got a point.
What an asshole!
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
Interesting approach. What was his name?
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
What are you doing for lunch?
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
