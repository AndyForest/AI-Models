You can go out there if you like...
Take your time.
Doubtful. What did he say?
You must have been concerned.
What happened?
One hundred books?
Uh-huh. What are they?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Really? You think so?
Hmm?
Good kids.
How did they threaten you?
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Me more than most.
A friend?
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
Why's that?
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
What's that?
Uh-huh.
Mr. Cook.
Not any more.
No, not really.
I'm fine.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
What's that?
I see.
What kind of doubts?
How do you mean?
My approach?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
Are we?
Right now?
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
My pleasure.
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
But you did come to me.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
It's a thought I had.
What's that?
Now we're back on track.
What?!
I didn't hear you.
Where's your wife, Henry?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
Stop now.
Henry!
Mr. Follett.
Good, then go.
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
I don't want to hear any more today.
What brought this on?
Mr. Gilroy --
Do you want to come in?
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
She seems very unhappy.
What do you think's wrong with her?
Tastes good.
A little.
You've done well.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
What do you do?
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
I've had my moments.
Nope.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
I'm sorry, your honor.
Yes.
Yes, your honor.
I do.
What it might take is... doing time.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Okay.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
He told you.
Lily.
...so rich?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Where am I supposed to eat?
Why do you watch?
...And?
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
It's a pretty piece of land.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
You like me. How come?
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Oh, I don't know...
What do you want to know?
It was Henry Follett.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
My patient had to leave early.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
You're right, as usual. See you.
Hello, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
Sure I can, Lionel.
-- Go on!
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
How are you?
Martin.
Is she a friend of yours?
I'm trying.
That would explain it.
You're good.
Don't need it.
Sure.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Wow. You're something.
Well... you see, the problem is --
Why don't you tell me?
No, I really don't.
What do you mean?
There's something I think we need to talk about.
That's right, the fake kind.
Ph.D., psychologist.
Will you be here?
Will you wait for me?
Anything... just ask.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
Will you think about it?
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
But...
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
You're not the only one...
You probably got the idea.
Sofie...
I guess you saw the show...?
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Hello.
Transference.
What was that?
I think so.
Okay...
I don't follow you.
I'm glad.
Um-huh.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Is it something you've heard about me?
You're upset.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Of course.
Of course.
I don't know if --
That's... good?
Yeah?
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
That's one way to put it.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
Either one.
That's what I like.
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
You like it?
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
Is that when you split up?
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Disgusting.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
Yes.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
You're doing great.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
I can give myself a headache instantly.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Life.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Sore throat?
Be specific.
Sorry... I'm done.
Really? What would it take?
I've offended you!
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?
Please... forgive me.
Something's bothering her.
Is she against you getting help?
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Maybe you'll catch it.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
We'll work it out.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
Hmm.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
No.
What?
When did you start to feel this way?
What can you tell me about this?
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
He agreed?
Really?
No again?
What did he want you to do?
What'd he say?
Do you think that's what he wants?
Uh-huh.
True. Should we stop them?
Was it something that happened at school?
What happened today?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
What do you want me to see?
That's not quite what I said --
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
Where was this?
It's my bit for the community.
It's called pro bono.
It's a big part of the show.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Weekly or monthly?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Yep.
What?
Yes, yes it does...
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Wow.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
What'd I do?
Really?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
You're completely reliable.
I'm honored.
See you Thursday... regular time.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
English Lit.
No... no training.
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
What about it?
All new people start with that...
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
That'd be Lily.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
Things got a lot worse.
But look at me now...
"Get to know your therapist."
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
It wasn't the best situation.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
I can tell you anything else.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Just you.
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Definitely.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
How's it coming?
A doll?
Slash what?
Jerking off?
Okay... let's say that, for now.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
It's just a thought.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Yep.
That's all right. What's on your mind?
Hey, Skip.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
This --
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
Amazing.
Well, there's Lily.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
I understand.
Is that the question?
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Nah... scotch.
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
How are you?
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
It's possible. I don't know about that.
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
