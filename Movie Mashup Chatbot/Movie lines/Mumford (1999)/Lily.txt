Well, come on in.
You do?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
I'd better get in there.
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
Oh?
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Doc.
Doc...
...so accomplished.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You're on your own today, honey.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
And the Brocketts?
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
Doc.  Ainge...
Not sure. Let me think about it.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
How long you been in this town?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Who was that?
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
