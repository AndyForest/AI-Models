Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
What?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
