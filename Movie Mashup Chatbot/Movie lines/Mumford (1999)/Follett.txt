Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
And the experiment is in here?
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
What exactly is it supposed to do?
Should I open it now?
What is it?
You are so mean.
I was... never satisfied.
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
Go to hell.
I never said that.
No?
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
You find it distasteful, don't you?
Why? I'm paying for this.
What?
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Why not?
I have eighteen more minutes!
