It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
What kind of doctor are you?
Do you think that's a good idea?
What's happening here?
Mumford... like the town?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Well, look who's here...
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
I think you do.
I think you know what I mean.
Finally, some common sense...
What?
What'd you want?
Oh... not a real doctor.
