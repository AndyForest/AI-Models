Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Did you straighten her out?
Hiya, Doc.
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
What's wrong with her?
Got to.
Can you help Mom?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Got a license?  But no car?
