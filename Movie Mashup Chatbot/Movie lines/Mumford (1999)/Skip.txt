Yeah.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
What are they?
That's a lot of people all at once.
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
What?
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
I guess that makes sense.
I'm here for you, Doc.
Sorry...
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Lily.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
You want my advice? Far out!
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Psych major?
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
And a birth certificate is enough?
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
How'd you do it?  The new you.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
And the drugs?
You and Candy...?
At least you pulled yourself out...
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
You were messed up, man.
Holy shit!
Did you carry a gun?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Sounds like you have several.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
What about everything? How did this happen?
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
It matters to me.
Damn! What is your name?
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
Who else knows?
It's not?
Really?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
You don't think I'm insane?
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
I wondered what happened to her...
Uh-huh.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
What?
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Good-looking woman.
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Don't you like this?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
This is exactly what I wanted.
This is great!
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
I've got three big ones.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
Would you like another beer?
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
