No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
Thank you.
Ernest, what do you think?
Yes... your particular approach.
That was a terrible thing.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
When?
