She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.

Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.

I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?

Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
