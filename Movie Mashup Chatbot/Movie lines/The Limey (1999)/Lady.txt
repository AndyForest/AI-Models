The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Sounds like you need a rest.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Where else?
No rest for the wicked.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
