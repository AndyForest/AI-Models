What am I doing?
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
Of the deal, man.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
It was you.  Downtown.
So what's your beef, pal?
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Yeah, I guess you are.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
