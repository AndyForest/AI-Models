Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
I like the colors.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
Italian.
Italian?
Oh, god.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.

Why?
What kind of food?
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
It's not a knock.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.

I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
