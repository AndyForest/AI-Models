It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Who's looking for you?
Are you finished?
You know I don't live with him.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
What kind of trouble are you in?
I don't want you here, Terry.
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
Since when?
What are you doing here?
