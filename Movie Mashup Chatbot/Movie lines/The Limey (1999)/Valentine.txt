Because --
No.
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
We think someone is here.
I sure hope so.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
What's the matter?
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
I'm a gracious host.
We all did.
Sure.
Who?
I'm sorry.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
Anything but Japanese.
As soon as you get dressed.
It's not a compliment.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
I'm not.
Am I a thing?
Not for you, clearly.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
You think I'm staying?
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Our black friends?
What kind?
What.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Go now.
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Is he here?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Susan.
No trouble.
Sure you do.
You've made it ... brighter.
I miss my kids.
Exercising my visitation rights.
Hello there.
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
Tell you ...
What.
Thanks.  You, too.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
I don't.
Ah.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
