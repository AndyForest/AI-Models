No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
I can take care of the paperwork.
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
Oh really?  Where you from?
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
Man knows what he likes.
