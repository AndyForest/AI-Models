Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
What do you think?
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Jennifer Wilson.
So why would he want to see you.
He's expecting you?
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
How'd you get in here.
