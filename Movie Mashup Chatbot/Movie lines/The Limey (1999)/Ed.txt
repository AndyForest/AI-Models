CQ what?
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Lookin' good.
What post office?
Do you have any friends, man?
I've been wondering something.
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
Too easy?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
You goin' back inside?
Faith.
No one else is even here yet.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
That was one of them?
Has he?
What?
Huh?
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Not me, man.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
You're kiddin' me, right?
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
Boomerang.
I dunno ... Maybe they do.
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
Terry Valentine.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
Huh?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
I didn't expect anyone.
Eduardo.  Rama.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
Didn't get it.
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
Same.
What d'you say, Elaine?
