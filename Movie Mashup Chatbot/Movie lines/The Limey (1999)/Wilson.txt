Yeah?
Been to the Boat Show.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Again?
He's gotta know why.
That would be too easy.
Steady on.
One thing I need.
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
What are we standing on?
First in, first out, that's me.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
What's so fucking funny?
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
And that's where you met Jenny.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
She didn't write to me, did she.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Did Jenny know?
Where abouts?
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
I only asked.
This ain't your lot?
Y'what?
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
What more is there.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
Snuffed her.
Who done it, then?
It was better than a telegram.
Round about, yeah.
No reason.
You're home, then.
Edward Rama?
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Bloke told me.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
Fancy it?
How far?
Where's Big Sur?
I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Black market during the war.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Not that I recall.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
You ever been to London?
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Just now?  Overnight?
Get seven years, did you?
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Hey?
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
I can see the attraction.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Tell us about it.
You don't seem bothered.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
And how did you get it?
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
I'll bloody well ask him.
Depends, don' it.
What do you think.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
Have you ever known me not to be.
Why not.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
My employer.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
Something like that, yeah.
Nah, accommodation address.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
He give me your address.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Footloose and fancy free.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
How'd you manage that, then.
She never told Eddie, though.
Ashamed.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Weren't you on a television series?
Here, are you always this sarky?
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
It was the bars, then.
What was that, then?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
How d'you mean?
Sort a few things out.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Had a feeling it was you.
And that is?
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
All of what?
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Eh?
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
No kidding.
Yeah?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Ian?
Yeah.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
Could do, yeah.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Been away a lot.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Yeah, that's right.
Where is he, then?
Is Valentine here?
You know her?
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
I doubt it.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
Walked.
<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
Tell me.
Be seein' you.
Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
You must know Ian.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Pleasure.
