If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
There's nobody coming?
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
What friend is that?
You're in here for winging a guy?
...And you had to kill him?
That's why they got you in jail?
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Sounds good.
Did it seem short to you?
McKendrick.
Gotta go.
Kate?
Is he alive?
Where's Jake?
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Have to.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
I'm sorry.
That's it.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
Where are we?
...Gotta go...
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
Where were you?
That I do.
I already did that.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
You must have known that before you came.
Are you all right?
Yeah... that must have been it.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
That's why I'm here.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Paden sends his best.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
My name is Emmett.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
I'll be long gone.
I haven't done anything.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
All right. I'm looking for a young fella, full of juice. About my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
You might make a farmer yet.
I'll see you around.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Yeah?
I'll be around.
Where you been?
Anybody got any ideas?
You haven't got any money.
No hard feelings.
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
I understand.
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
He is that.
Which way do you mean?
I expect.
I expect.
It's a town...
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
I gotta be going.
I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
South of here, past Chimayo.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Looks like that's not all they admired.
I had to get up anyway.
No, Leavenworth.
Not for five years.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
