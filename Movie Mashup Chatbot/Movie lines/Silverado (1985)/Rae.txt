Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Because I'm your sister.
What makes you think I could?
What's stopping you?
Why come to me?
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
I don't have any family any more.
It's none of your business.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
Who did it?
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
