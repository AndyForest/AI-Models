It was my fault.
Your next water ain't for three days.
I think we lost 'em.
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
The one with the shotgun.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
All I did was kiss a girl.
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
New record.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
All I did was kiss the girl.
Who is he?
This a friend of yours?
He'll be here.
We wait.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Right!
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
