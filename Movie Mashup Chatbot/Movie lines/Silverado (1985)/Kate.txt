I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.

J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
