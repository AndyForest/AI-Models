I've got a job.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
All right, you buy me a drink.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
It's not going to be easy.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
Doesn't look quite fair.
Women?
They got a saloon there?
What's Turley like?
Going to Turley, was it?
And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about.  'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it.  I surely do miss that hat.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Where's Turley?
Where's the pinto going?
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Jefferson City?
Offend anybody lately?
You got no idea what they were after?
What's that?
Why?
Believe it.
And a pretty lady.
Never will again.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
Let's get out of here.
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
Get out of here, Jake.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
He is now.
Where's your brother?
What now?
We didn't get that far.
The other guy drew first.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
I was afraid of that.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
You're kidding.
We'd rather stay.
Where's Emmett now?
Lucky.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Good luck, Mal.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
What's she got to do with it?
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
What is it you want from me?
Well, thanks, but forget it.
It is that.
This is a lot of money.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Luck, I guess.
I just got to town.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
You're right.
You've got a legitimate job.
I've given that up.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
It's been a while.
Hello, Cobb.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
What makes you say that?
What do you mean?
He left me.
Give me some of the good stuff.
Oh, yeah? How good?
What's this?
I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
Is this a fair mix?
Who's the owner?
Why'd you go into business with him?
So-called?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
It's the only place I'm happy.
And I know what I'm talking about.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
Paden.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Nifty.
You work here?
