This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
It's one thing to know it...
This is a brutal land.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
Goodbye?
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
They've been kind to me.
Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.
More than enough.
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
Because they don't like what I want.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
