Right.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
McKendrick's men got him.
I almost didn't.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
You'll never make it.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Sure.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
What about the law?
You own this land.
Who?
What happened?
Where is Rae?
Daddy?
That ain't right.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Why him?
Why would they stop you?
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Rae, I need help.
Rae, all we got is each other.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
He was murdered.
Daddy's dead.
Hello, Rae.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
I got there just short of too late.
You don't know?
Because they enjoy it.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
