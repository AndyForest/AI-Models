I've got a place I can hide her.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
How about you?
I'm ready for that.
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
What is it that I can't figure?
Where's the dog now?
You really are a gambler.
That's the good stuff.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Here he comes right now.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You like a good saloon?
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Stella.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
I run the place. What can I get you?
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
I wouldn't worry about that.
That was my plan.
