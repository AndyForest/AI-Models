I want you out of town before the hanging.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Ten A.M.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Don't press your luck, Carter.
Is that a fact?
I don't like that word much, Carter.
What's all this then?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.

But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
