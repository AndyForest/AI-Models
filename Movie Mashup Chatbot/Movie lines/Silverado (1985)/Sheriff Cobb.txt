Really?
I'm done talking. Get out.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
What about his brother?
He must be pretty good.
Good-bye, Paden.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
I thought we talked about that.
I'm going to have to look into this.
So we understand each other?
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
I took out thirteen dollars.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
What brings you into my saloon?
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
You got a place to stay?
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Where's the dog?
I see you're prospering without me.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
I thought you two would get along.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
