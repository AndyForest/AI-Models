Well, he's young and he's healthy.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
Sixteen next month.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
So why have you told me about it?
Unless you get caught.
The point is, you've got to find something new.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
Too young for what?
Smells like it.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Is that a promise, then?
Are you clean?
Can I see you again?
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Holding hands?
I don't see why not.
And don't make any noise.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Out.
Right. You can't sleep here.
Shut up.
Ssshh!
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
What?
It's where I live.
I'm going home.
Diane.
Thanks.
