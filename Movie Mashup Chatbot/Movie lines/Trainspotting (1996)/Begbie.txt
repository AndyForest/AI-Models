You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
OK. Same again?
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Bit fucking late, like.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
No. On you go.
You were in my way.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Shag her senseless.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
For fuck's sake.
Ninteen.
Twenty thousand.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
I'd fucking kill you.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Did you bring the cards?
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
