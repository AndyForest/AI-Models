I will. Come and kiss me.
Of course I will.
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Ellie...Ellie...what...
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Honey, Church will be fine.
Yes, but the rope might be--
It's gorgeous!
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Was it Pascow?
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Louis, are you sure?
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I'm going to try to do better.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
I heard you tonight.
I got eggs down here!
Thank you, Louis.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
She's finally asleep.
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
It's beautiful!
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Gage's gone!
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
