Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Good God, you're really-
What?
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
Never even heard of anything like it.
How is he?
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
