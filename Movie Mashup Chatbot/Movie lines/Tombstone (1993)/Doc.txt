Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Isn't that a daisy?
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Say when.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
On three?  You call it.
That's just my game.
In pace requiescat.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
That's the rumor.
Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
Not exactly...
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Better.
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
Enough?  Never.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
Never got to wear one of those.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
In vino veritas.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
I'll remember you said that.
Ignore her?
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
Very instructive
Very cosmopolitan.
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Since when is faro a business?
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
What?
I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
I don't.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Don't touch me!
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
