McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
I just got it fixed.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Morg, use your head.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
That didn't sound like thunder.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
How you doin', boy?
I know.  And nobody can make him.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Yeah?
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
I'll be damned...
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
We should get moving.
Sure...
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Jack...
Virgil?
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
All right, Virge, your call.  But Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
You'll never make that stick.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
I know, I need a keeper.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
So to speak.
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna Get ours.  Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
None of my business, Fred.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
Yeah, and dangerous.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
What about all these saloons?
