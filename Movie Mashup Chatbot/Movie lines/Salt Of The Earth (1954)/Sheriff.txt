Got any more ideas?
You want 'em all arrested?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
Mornin'.
