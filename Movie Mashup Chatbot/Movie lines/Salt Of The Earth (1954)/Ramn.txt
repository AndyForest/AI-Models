There's nothing stopping you.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
You're welcome to one.
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
What do you mean -- sex equality?
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
The woman question?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
It never ends.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
I say we gotta take action. Now.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Who? A scab?
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
So much the better.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Will you be still?
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Like what?
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
No.
Sun up.
Hunting.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Be still ...
You weren't waiting for me.
A meeting?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
How do you feel?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
You all right?
Can be what?
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
No.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Over my dead body.
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
They say I am no good to you.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
A fighter, huh?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
What's the matter?
I did forget. Lu�s told me.
Antonio paid for it.
I'm a fool.
Aaah, what's the use?
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Now don't start talking against the union again.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
Forget it.
This water's cold again.
Got to talk to the brothers.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
You mean Delaware?
You should have helped her without being asked.
You've got to help around the house!
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
The what!
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Where's your mama?
Lu�s! Come down here!
Forgot what?
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
T�! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
What attitude?
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
