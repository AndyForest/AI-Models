Yes. We will light the candles.
They are singing for me.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Later. When I finish the ironing.
No, Estellita.
With Ram�n it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
No. No. I can't. If Ram�n ever found me on a picket line ...
To the mine?
What are you saying?
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Ram�n were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
You mean you're ready to give up?
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Ram�n -- you can't.
Alone?
When?
Where are you going?
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
Tell me.
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
I waited up till midnight.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
I've had them since the day they were born.
I'm going back tomorrow.
Yes.
Sure.
Backward.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Let them take it!
What makes you so sure?
You are no good to me -- in jail.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
He'll have it good. Some day.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Was it expensive, the beer?
No, no ...
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Never... never... never!
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
What has it got me, your union?
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
What's more important than sanitation?
What?
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
Where you going?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
