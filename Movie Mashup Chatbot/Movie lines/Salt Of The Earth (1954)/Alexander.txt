Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
That's none of their affair.
No thanks.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
I don't make policy.
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
You haven't tried locking them up!
Well?
Whose side are you on anyway?
How's it going?
