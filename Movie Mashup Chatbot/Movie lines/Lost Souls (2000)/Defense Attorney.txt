Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
And how would you describe him?
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
You have to tell me who did it.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
