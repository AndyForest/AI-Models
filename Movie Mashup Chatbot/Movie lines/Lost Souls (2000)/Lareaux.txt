...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Miette, come here and relax.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.

...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
Just open the door, please.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
