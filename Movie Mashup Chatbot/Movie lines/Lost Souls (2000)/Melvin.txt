Goodbye.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
You are the younger of two...
