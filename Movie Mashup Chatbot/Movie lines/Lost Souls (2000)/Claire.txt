We're still going to be together.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Must be a spare set.
I don't know.  What are they?
This is the person...you were talking about?
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
Thank God he did.
I'm still shaking.
When did they find her?
What?  That's horrible!
I spaced out.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Peter, where are you?
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Sushi.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Bad?
You never said anything to me...
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
I missed you.
Eight.  That okay?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
...you wearing a watch, Father?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Peter, are you okay?
