You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
I found the pentacle.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
I found them in your file box.
What're these?
Claire...
I believe in you.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
Yeah, like...
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
I can't believe Will killed him.
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
What happened?
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Hmmm.
Uh...sure...I...what?
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
It's probably trivial.
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
Do you think they have a room here?
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
No, I wasn't, actually.
My secretary?
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
You killed my parents.
You raised me, like a son.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You fucking bastard.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Something he said, just before...
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
You ready?
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
How much time do we have?
And what's that mean?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
Terrific.
What did he say to you in French?
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
What can I do?
Sure.
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Plenty of time.
What about after?
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
No oxygen to the brain.
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
That's true.
We're going to do this.
What do you mean?
Are you alright?
What's the bible for?
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
What?
You okay?
What?
What's the...OH SHIT!
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
I'm going to look around.
What are you looking for exactly?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Yes.
So what?
Yes, I know.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
I don't understand what's going on.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
You should think about getting professional help.
Trick him.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
What?!?!
And the point is?
Why did he try to kill me?
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
We need to talk.
Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
So what'd I miss?
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
I'll bet.
I do.
What's that got to do with you?
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
Yes... and you are?
May I help you?
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
Get out of here.
You know what?  You can go.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
We millionaires yet?
Yeah.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Of course.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
There weren't any voices.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Where is she now?
She told me she killed them.
What happened?
Parents died?
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
What's up?
Thanks again for everything.
Thanks for handling this.
He could see me.
He's looking right at me.
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
What's this?
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
