What time did you make it for?
Yes.  It's exactly...
Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
What a...jerk!
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
He spoke to you?
What is it?
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
