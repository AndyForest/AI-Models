Would you sign it for me?
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
What do you mean by that?
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
