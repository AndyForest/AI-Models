You have more in common than you know.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
Again?
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
Hello.
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Six one.
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
I'm travelling too.
In case you get back before I do.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
I have your samples ready.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
Not bad, Jerome.
I was never very good at it, remember?
Hello?
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
How long?
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
You may as well invite her here.
Where are you taking her?
I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
Again?
Where are we going?
She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
How was your evening?
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
If you say so.  The stripe.
Is that all?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
I'm sure I could have.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
Where?
What makes them think that?
What are you talking about?
Any particular reason?
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
You know I'm scared of heights.
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
What <i>is</i> that one?
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
You wish.
Who died?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
God, you're serious, aren't you?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
You really need that much?
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
It needs work.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
