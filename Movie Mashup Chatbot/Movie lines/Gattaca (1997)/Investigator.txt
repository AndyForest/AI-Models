Where did you get this?
Luca could still be an accomplice.
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
What are you waiting for?
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
Something's not right.
Blood.  From the vein.
A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
Grudges?
A man's dead, Detective.
At least it's nothing contagious.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Thank you, no.
This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
We believe we have a suspect.
Surely you know what you have.
How often do you test, Director?
A fingerprint.  There's something to be said for nostalgia.  What did you find?
Hugo!  I've found him!
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
You worried about the cost?
Why not?
