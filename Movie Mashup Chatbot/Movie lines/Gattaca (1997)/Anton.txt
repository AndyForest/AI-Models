Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
It's for the best.
It's over.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
