I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
What a relief.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
Often.
