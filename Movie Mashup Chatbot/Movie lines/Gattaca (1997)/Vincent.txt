German.
Suit yourself.
What's wrong with it?
You okay, Jerome?
He's too tall.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?

How tall are you?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
That's the hair color in his profile?
How do I square the accident?
I hope he's not just a body.
German, is that you?
What do you think?
