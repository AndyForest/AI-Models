Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
Now is your chance to find out.
Who are you trying to convince?
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
There are a few million miles to go yet.
You almost sound like you believe that.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
I'll see what I can do.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
Why have you done this?
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
How the hell did you get here.
How are you, Jerome?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
Will you be okay?
Everybody goes there.
Michael's.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
Good choice.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
You really had other offers?
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
They'll recognize me.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Come on--we're taking off.
In a corridor.
They found my eyelash.
They think I offed the Director.
We can't stay here.
Call German.
It's all right.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
It's okay, Eugene.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
A day or so.
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
Let's get out of here.
You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
That's not the point.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
The Mission Director.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
It's not too late to back out.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
You had to be a right-hander.
What about this?
I have to know where you come from.
A year is a long time.
We could go together one day.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
Come on.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
Let's walk.
Those checks take forever.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Of course.
What exactly is wrong?
You'll be next.
Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
Does it have a name?
Where?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
Have they found our friend?
We were just looking.
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
Why don't we say we were together?
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Last night?  I was at home.
No bother.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
There's a problem, Lamar.
What's this, Lamar?
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Only every time I'm in here.
