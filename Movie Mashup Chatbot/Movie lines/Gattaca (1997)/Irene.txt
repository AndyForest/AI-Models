What's wrong with him?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
It's about the Director.
Good to see you're feeling better.
Jerome--?
Not so long--just once around the sun.
--when you go away.
What is it?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
What happened?
My medication.  I left it back there.
I can't.
Who are they?
What about the car?
Why are we leaving?
What <i>is</i> this place?
So you didn't do it after all.
Of course I think about it every day.
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
I envy you, Jerome.
You're angry--
You didn't know?
You celebrate, Jerome?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
In the South Wing.
They found an eyelash.
Friend?
I know about you.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
Why would we do that?
No.
Yes.
I was at home.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
