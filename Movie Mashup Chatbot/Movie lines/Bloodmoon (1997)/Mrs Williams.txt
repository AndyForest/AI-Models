I'll get a coat for her.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
He comes over to study.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Would you like a piece of cake?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
