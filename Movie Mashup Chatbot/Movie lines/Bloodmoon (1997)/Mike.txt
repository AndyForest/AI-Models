Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
