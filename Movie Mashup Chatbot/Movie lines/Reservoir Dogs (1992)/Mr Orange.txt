I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
Nope.
He don't believe in it.
He don't tip.
Mr. Pink.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Freddy Newendyke.
You do?
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
Joe.
I'm okay.
No, I'm not!
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
