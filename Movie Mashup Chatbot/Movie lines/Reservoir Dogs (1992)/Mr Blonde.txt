Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Now where were we?
Alone at last.
I don't like alarms.
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
You didn't ask.
Nice Guy Eddie.
It's a surprise.
Down to my car.
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
What're you talkin' about?
What's this guy's problem?
So, talk.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
