He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
I can do that.
I gotta memorize all this shit?

But what is this?
What?
What's this?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
The Brewers.
A little.
Me and Mr. White?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
Who, Mr. White?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
I'm sorry.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.

You can do some crazy things with it.
Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
