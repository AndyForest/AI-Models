I don't wanna lift crates.
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
Seymour Scagnetti.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
You fuckin' wish.
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Fine, now.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Sure.
It's a change.
