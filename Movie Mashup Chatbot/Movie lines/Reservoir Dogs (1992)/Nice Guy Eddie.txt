Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
You don't believe in tipping?
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
