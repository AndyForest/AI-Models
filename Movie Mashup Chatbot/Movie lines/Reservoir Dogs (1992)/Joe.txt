That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
We can work this out, can't we?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
What?
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
How is he?
Who's your parole officer?
Take a seat.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Wong?
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Dead as Dillinger.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Like hell I am.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
What for?
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
What's she doin' now?
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Give me my book.
What do you care?
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
Aren't you?
Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Mr. Pink?  Why?
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
