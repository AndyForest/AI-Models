Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
How could you have been so stupid?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
I�ll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isn�t with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, how�s your mother?
I see.  One thing�s for sure, he�s ambitious. You�ll be a busy man from now on.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Yes.  This way.
