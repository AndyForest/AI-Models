Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Why, yes.
I�m sorry...
It seems fine.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
You won�t regret this, sir.
I�ve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompson�s office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
I�m your new assistant.
Patricia Crenshaw.
Sorry, sir.
