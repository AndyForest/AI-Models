How will we interrogate them?
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
The other one?
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
What's he doing here?
Spinning backwards?
How long have you been here?
Was that for real down there?
What is this place?
Just like that?
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Doctor!  What brings you here?
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
Police.  Nobody move.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
I see...
Lost something?
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
It�s extremely important to my investigation...
A hunch.  He might be able to...
She�s getting better, thanks.  She...
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasn�t this his case?
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Good evening, sir.
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Put it through...
Who is it?
Well be more careful, please.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
How can I submit this?
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Wrong?  Look at this!
You typed this report?
Fine.
Good.
I didn�t requisition a secretary.
Don�t ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Dammit!
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...
Go on.
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
They didn't have faces.
Don't know much, do you?
Why are they after you?
Who?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
Why give yourself up?
Shut-up.
But...  How long has this been happening?
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
What is going on?
What?  Who has?
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
