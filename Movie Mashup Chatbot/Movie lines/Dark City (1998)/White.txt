Not really...
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Sell maps?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
I need something to keep me awake.
What now?
Where do you think this goes?
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
What?
Don't know that either.
I don't know who they are.
People...  after me.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Where are we going?
Where does it lead?
You see it?
No.  Have a look.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
What is that door?
I didn't realise...
Wait, this isn't fair...
But I...
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
Shut up!
Just let me sit here for a moment? I�ll go soon, and stop bothering you.
No.  I mean...  that isn�t necessary.
Someone�s after me.
No.  I, ah...
What is it?
What happened to you?
What are you hiding?
It's a trick.
Why?
You've been working too hard.
Not that again...
So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
You're a liar!
I have to go...
I'm sorry.  About before.
Can I get my life back?
I'm nothing then.
Horrible...
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Known me for long?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Yes.
That's what people keep telling me.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
You know something about me?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
How do you know I'm innocent?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
