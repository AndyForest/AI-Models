I'm afraid so.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
In there.
Please, they'll kill me...
You are mistaken.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Loose ends?
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
He's seriously disturbed...
Just visiting my patient.
He tried to kill me!
We are...  living in their dreams...
I'm...  being...  punished.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
No, it's the truth.
You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...
What are you doing?
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
Maybe.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
Well...
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
If you like.
Tell me about them...
Bad dreams?
Your name is John White.
What does she say?  The woman.
Water?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
