All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
Hold it!
...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
What?  Say again...
If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...
Any of them Richard Long?
Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
Is it--?
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!

What?  Say again, Ma-...

He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Negative.  Negative.
...gotta seal it.
