...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
You-You can't let him...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
...here.   Mason...
...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
I had no idea how powerful it was.
We do need your truck.
...to Fort McGruder in his truck.
Mason, you have to take this...
nan
So far, ye-yes.
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
All right.  After they put you away...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
Grateful?
...that.
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
No, go--
nan
...about--
...I wish they would've let me say something...
Andrew...
It's too...
You'll kill us all!
No!
No!
...destroyer of worlds."
"I am become Death, the...
Let's proceed.
You have my word on that.
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
Now listen to me.
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?

You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
And I changed the schedule.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
Ah.
Uh, we both like to fish.
Oh, no?
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Excellent.
nan
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
...that the prey can bite back.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...-m-means, Mason.
The only one who understands what this me-...
You're the only one I can trust.
Everything will die, Mason.
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.

...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Tie a fly...
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
...the master of his realm.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
He's brains without ambition...
...is a perfect hunter.
No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout...
My secret?

So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
