Ooh.
Oh, oh!
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
That's bullshit.
No.
...us.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
Thank you.
Yeah.
Patriotism is its own reward.
Us.  Owes us.
You.
You, Arlo.
Who had to put a gun to your head?
You did help a little.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
nan
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo.
nan
nan
Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!
nan
nan
What'd you come back for?!
nan
nan
They'll meet you at the top.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Let's go!
nan
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
There's gotta be...
nan
...-ta get outta here!
We got-...
nan
It's working.
nan
Come on.  Come on.
Oh.
nan
nan
What?
It says forty- nine.
What's it say?
nan
I'm gonna kill him.
You've gotta be...
What the hell?
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Whoo!
Tunnel.
...our ass!
And Brynner's right on...
I've got the real thing!
Okay.
Forty-five seven!
Oh, fuck!
...-ful?!
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
nan
nan
Stop.
Go!
Sometimes the prey bites back.
...to him.
That's why I didn't give it...
nan
Go, go, go!
nan
nan
nan
nan
Arlo!
nan
nan
Okay.
nan
Yeah.
Come on!
Reach into my pocket.
Arlo!  Arlo.
nan
Put your hand in my pants.
Hey, hey, hey.
Arlo, shut up.
Hey, just shut up.
nan
Huh?
nan
Listen, Arlo.
No.
nan
Ow!
nan
You all right?
Bring him down!
Yeah, I know, I know.
Yeah.
Whoo!
nan
nan
...split.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
...shit.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
Listen, Arlo...
We got two paddles.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
...hospital.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
We were nationally  ranked.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
Yeah.
...truck.
So you took his...
It won't even start half the time.
...stole the truck.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
You're fucked, man.
nan
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
What?
nan
nan
nan
nan
nan
No!
nan
Keep still.
nan
Come on!
I don't want you to come anyway.
...here!
Then stay...
nan
Taking it down the hill.
nan
I'm crazy?
I'm a dangerous man!
Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.
All right, let's go.
Aw, shit
These'll keep it cold.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
Okay.
All right.
nan
Come on.
nan
nan
Go on.
nan
Hey!
Hang on!
nan
...ho!
Ho, ho...
Gee, you think so?
Shit.  You gotta pass him.
You okay?
I made it.
I made it!
Whoo!
All right, you got it, you got it!
nan
Get over!  Get over!
Left, left, left!
...easy, easy, easy.
Oh...
Oh, shit.
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Goddamn!
Okay.
nan
That's right.  Now,  move!
...do we?
I don't think we have much of a choice...
nan
...we can make it.
I think...
Oh, shit.
nan
Fuck!
All right, you got it.
...up!
Back up!  Back...
...man!
Holy shit...
nan
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
nan
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
Yeah...
You wanna hit me?
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...I'm not the psycho.
No...
nan
I was thankin' you, asshole!
nan
Nice job back there.
Elvis is on ice again.
nan
All right.
nan
nan
nan
nan
...-ed.
...work!  It's not even load-...
Doesn't...
Doesn't work.
Shut up.
nan
nan
nan
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
Ah, one of them's in the back.
...-damn!
God-...
Fine.
nan
Shut up.
...fine.
That's...
Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  We're goin' to McGruder.
...the ice cream for money!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
You stole this truck! That's...
You stole this truck!
You stole this truck.
Borrowed.
Am I missing somethin' here?
...-er.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No cell.
We're clear.
...town.
You'd better coast through...
nan
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Excuse me...
What the hell's goin' on?
Come on!
nan
...up.
Shut...
Come on, get in the truck.
That dog ain't mean.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
Go on.
I need your truck!
All right, then how about this?
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I got, uh....
I got, like, uh....
You want cash?
You want cash?
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
All right.
...-er.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
I need your help.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
...-tana.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
I need your truck.
No.
Hang on.  Hang on.
Why don't I--?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
He could've called first.
...moron.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
nan
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Since when does...
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
That's my business.
Art.
Freezer in the back.
Where's Sam?
A little early for a delivery.
nan
You'd never understand!

You try anything, it goes in...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
Hello.
Elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  Get yourself some CDs.
I don't know what the hell...
Yeah?
Like I say, Doc Long's...
...though.
Not tonight...
...time to time, yeah.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...Long.
Doc...
Assumptions are always dangerous.
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...deer.
Quite a getup for jacking...
I assume you want that to go.
....-lene.
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
Mornin'.
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
Two pots of coffee...
Yeah?
I can handle it.
...-time,  remember?
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
nan
Let me have those.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
Yeah, I just....
Doctor.
And what if it does?
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Call an ambulance.
Shit!  Oh, shit.
Doc!
...fishin'.
...-to a simple thing like...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...like a fish.
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
Been trying to figure out your secret.
nan
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
Yeah.
God!  They're gonna seal it.
Forty-seven.
I'm at mile marker...
We've got the real thing!
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Yeah, yeah...
All right, go.
You sure?
nan
All right.
The Army, sealin' us in.
nan
Just go check the temperature.
...tunnel now!
...we're all gonna die in this...
Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
nan
...side!
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
...on the other end of this phone.
...there's a colonel...
Listen, Pappas...
nan
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
Pappas!  Move the car!
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
...beer.
I didn't sell the boy any...
...seriously.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...-lem?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
