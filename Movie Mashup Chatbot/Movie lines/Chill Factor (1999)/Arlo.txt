Come on, Night Shift.
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
...that is going to explode...
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
It's a damn postal truck!
Shit!

Damn.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Oh, shit.

Oh...

At least somebody likes this shit.
Okay, okay.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
That's right.
you see, that was a-that was my mission.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
I feel faint.
Oh!
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
...-tiatin'.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
Thank you very much.
I think so too.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
Hello.
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
Who put the big hurt on...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who drove the ice cream...
Always the negative...
Stop limpin' around like that.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Well.
nan
nan
nan
Why'd you stay behind?!
Look out.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Go.
Hang on, hang on.
Sorry.
nan
Hold this.
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?
Vitelli! Vitelli!
nan
nan
What?
What?
nan
nan
All right
nan
It's melting, man.
Mason.
Forty-nine point four.
Shoot me.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Stupid.

Whoo!

I'm sorry.  I'm a little
Okay.
All right.  Okay.
nan
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.

We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
What?
nan
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
nan
We're gonna die!
They're movin'.
They're takin' off.
Hey!
Are you all right?
nan
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
nan
nan
...man.
A-And you  owe me...
...or my conscience.
...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...deal with this asshole.
I think you oughta cut a...
Hey.   Mason.
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
Yeah, baby!
That is loud!  I'm
Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
...miles.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
...shit.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
...-er.  It was your friend...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
I mean, if that gun was...
Not completely, anyway.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
nan
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Robert Del Rio?
How wonderful for you.
You know.
So I took his truck, yeah.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
...overdrawn bank accounts.
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
You know what I'm sayin'?
...piece of shit was worth.
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...-tion?
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...did you?
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
Worth a try.
Okay.
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
Uh-oh.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
nan
All right.  Hey.
nan
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, shit!
nan
Okay.  Okay.
nan
Oh, shit.
What?
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
You're--?  What?!
He's crazy!
...man!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...you're dealin' with!
...to him!  You don't know who...
Listen!  Listen...
nan
Okay.  All right.  Okay.
nan
nan
...yeah.
Yeah...
Okay.  Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay.
Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.
No.  Shit.
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
nan
Go, go.
Shit.
nan
nan
nan
...shit!
Oh...
nan
Shut up!
Okay.  That didn't work.
Holy--!
Gee, you think so?
What the fuck was that?!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
Whoo!
...you crazy bastard.
Come on...
Come on.
Come on.
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on, old...

...Night Shift, but you might...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...

Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...Pete!  Come on.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Come on.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
God, man!
Come on, old Pete.
Come on!
Come on, old Pete.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
nan
Okay.
Oh, shit.
nan
Oh, shit.
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy!
...Shift.
Oh, we're screwed, Night...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
Come on, old...
nan
Oh, shit.
Oh!
nan
Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.
...waiting!
Well, then, that means it's call...
...truck!
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
I did not steal the truck.
...let live.
...I believe in live and...
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...you.
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
...-er!
...-cho and a hijack-...
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
Kiss my ass!
...gun?!
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
Okay.
Okay!  All right!
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
Oh...
Oh, shit.
You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!
What?
Take your gun!
nan
You're nuts, goin' back there!
nan
Okay.
Okay, okay!
nan
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
Hey.
I ain't playin' that.
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
I did not steal this truck!
Yeah, borrowed!
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
No, no, no.
...-er.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
Oh, man.
nan
Do you wanna give me a minute?
...-ed.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
...all the time.
It happens to this piece of shit...
Damn.
Are you kiddin'?
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
That dog was mean before I met him.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
nan
Would you hurry up, please?
You are not takin' my truck!
...doing?!
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
No.
nan
Peace.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible.
And if that Elvis shit...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
...truck.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
For cryin' out loud.
...ya?
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
...and a shitload of ice.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
nan
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
What did I say?
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
Oh.
Huh?
That'll make up the difference, huh?
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
...and fair...
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
Except for the fact that I need cash.
Uh, huh?
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
nan
Since today.  New policy.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
No argument there.
Great.
Where do you want this stuff?
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
...-ty.
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Oh...
nan
Hey!
nan
nan
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Well, well, well.
Oh, my God.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
Listen, shithead!
nan
What'd he say?
It's for you.
I'll keep an eye out.
That was quick.
Be cool.  Be--
Hey, be cool.
Hey.
...help you?
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
Well, that just about figures for today.
Hey, actually...
nan
So you called the damned thing Elvis
...take my sorry old truck.
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
Yeah, that's my truck.
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
He's the dude...
Listen, deputy.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
I'd say we're about even.
Exactly.
Us.  Owe us.
Thank you.
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
We've got it...
nan
Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
nan
