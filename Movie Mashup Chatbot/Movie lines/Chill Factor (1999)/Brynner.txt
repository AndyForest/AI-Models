Vaughn.
...such is the price...of patriotism.
But...
And it won't be pleasant.
nan
Three seconds.  One...
...without compunction.
This country trained me to kill...
I urge you to be persuasive.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
...within five minutes.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
...about him.
We're worried...
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
nan
Forget about him.
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
And let me guess.  You failed.
Almost quaint.
"Went away."  I like that.
Went away?
...always done, Richard?
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
...you were right, of course.  But after...
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Mm-hm.
...and the government.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...-ple.
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
You look fit...healthy...
You look good, Richard.
Is this stool taken?
There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
nan
All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...-bility.
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
...to be off the island tonight.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
...-tor Long.
Doc-...
I'll do it.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
Pleasant surprise.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
...happen if I drop this?
Do you know what'll...
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street.  Fan out and work your way back to the motel.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
nan
nan
Hit him again.
Hit him.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Of which we have more than enough.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
nan
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Radio the bikes.
nan
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
...comes up that road.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
nan
This is it.
nan
nan
Stay put.  Keep the camera trained on...
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
...here!
I wanna patch in from...
Get your links set up!
Dennis!
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Prep the launcher now.
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
You have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way.  I think we can impose on you for a little overtime.
Check the immediate area.
Check it out.
Vaughn.
Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous...
Richard Long.
You know the suspect?
...-ty.
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
...gear?
Where's their protective...
...scientists.
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
...screwup?
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
But...
...-fall.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
They took that life away and left me with nothing.
I would've in another life.
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
nan

Where's Elvis?!
No.
It won't be long, gentlemen.

...-spite the mouth.
...and unharmed, de-...
Your fellow hero, untouched...
Bring him up.
...-tainer!
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
I don't see my container.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
...never done a thing for you?
...to die for a country that's...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
I want you to look at one another...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
...should be right outside.
Odd, then, that his car...
nan
I assume you have one.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I beg your pardon?
...dangerous.
Assumptions are always...
Iced coffee.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Is this your establishment?
