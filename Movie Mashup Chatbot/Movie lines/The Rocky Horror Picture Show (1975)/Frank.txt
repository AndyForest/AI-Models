You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Rocky!
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
On my mother's grave.
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
Oh well.  How about you.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
What guy
What a guy
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
I didn't make him for you
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Free to try and find a game
Like I'm outside in the rain
Smile and that will mean I may
Want to come again and stay
Was all I had to say
On the day I went away.
So come up to the Lab.
