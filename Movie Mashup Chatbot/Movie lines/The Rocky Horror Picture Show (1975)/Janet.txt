If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I hope so my darling.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Oh don't be so shy.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
Brad...
Weiss.
Oh Brad.
Right!
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Well I want to leave.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Oh....Say something.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
I'm coming with you.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Oh...
What was that bang?
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
For you.
Oh Brad.
Uh huh.
Yes Brad.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Makes you cry
Makes you cry
Promise you won't tell Brad.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
Who's Eddie?
Oh.
Oh, lucky him.
Are you - giving a party?
You're too kind.
