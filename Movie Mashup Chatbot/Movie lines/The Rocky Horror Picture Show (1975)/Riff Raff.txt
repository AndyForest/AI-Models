Yes.
You know this earth - this person.
You're wet.
Hello.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
A decision had to be made.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
The delivery boy.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
I think you had better both come inside.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
Creature of the night.
