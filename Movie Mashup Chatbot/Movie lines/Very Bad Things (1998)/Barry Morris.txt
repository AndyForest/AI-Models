So. When is the wedding.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
There's more.
