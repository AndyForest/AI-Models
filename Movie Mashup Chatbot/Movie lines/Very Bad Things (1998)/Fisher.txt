I got you.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I don't think so.
What.
No way.
What happened? Oh my God...
I know...
I know and I'm honored...
I won't do it.
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
No. I think it's fucked.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Real times.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
We'll be ready Adam.
You need help.
Not a prayer.
You're sick.
I'm serious.
Fine? Fine what?
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
Isn't it a little late?
Now?
Hear what?
Yeah.
What does that mean?
I don't know...
What does that mean?
What are you going to do?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Regarding what?
What's your point?
I just want to get married.
What?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
I said, what have we done?
What?
Boyd...What have we done?
He's cracked up.
Easy Boyd.
He's having a problem here.
Shut up Boyd.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
You always were a jealous man.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
I'm talking about prayer.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
I'm calling the police.
Good God...Good God...
Oh God. This is insane.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Call 911.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
I can't.
We need padded chairs.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
You said that Boyd.
I do.
What?
Are we supposed to?
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
But...
No...
What?
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
Move the bodies?
So what do we do?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
He kept saying he was protected.
What money?
But...
But...
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
It's too late.
Micheal, by accident.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
The prostitute.
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
No it's not okay. It's not.
Yes.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Okay. Okay.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
I know.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
Can we just talk this out?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
This is our honeymoon.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
I'm working on it.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
What!
Okay.
No. Just like an hour or so.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
Hey. It's me.
I'll see you tomorrow...
I'm mad at you.
Nesting?
What are you doing?
Well I do.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Not yet.
Hi.
I love you.
Of course.
I will.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
I'll call them from the road.
We're leaving in three hours.
Honey I don't have the time...
Go down where?
So what do we do?
What kind of seats can we have?
I'm not. What's the problem?
Okay.
Problems?
With all my heart.
Of course.
You will not be common!!!
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
That's absurd.
Time out.
You expect more what?
He's a great chef.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
He's quiet.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
You don't like Moore? Since when?
Who else?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
What are you talking about?
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
He is.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
How do you figure?
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
I wouldn't know.
Are we going to do this again?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
What?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
How could I know what else I forgot?
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Why what?
I think so.
I think I forgot the tent.
Yes.
Yup.
Sent it.
Sent it.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
I think so.
I'm not sure.
I don't think so.
We missed the deadline.
Government cutbacks.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
I love you dad.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
You did all right dad.
What is it?
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
I think so.
The wahoo moment?
The wahoo?
Have another drink.
I don't hear it.
Buzzing?
Where did you get that?
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
I'm getting married...
Go for it.
He's your brother.
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
I'm not breathing right.
I just want her to be happy.
About what?
What does that mean?
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Yup.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
That's a good one.
Yeah?
There.
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
Did he try to kiss you?
My God...
Downstairs in the closet.
Greenpeace?
A move?
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
I have no idea.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
The first day.
I got to agree with that.
No...No.
Yup.
