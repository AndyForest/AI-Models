All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
They won't figure it out.
It has worked.
Adam! Calm down.
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
Who? What are you talking about?
What?
What is your problem?
Any time fat boy!
Watch the tone fella.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
What does that mean?
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Alright. Let's do it.
We have to get going.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
So that's what we're doing.
How do you figure?
We've already done this.
What?
Sun rises at 5:52.
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
Her fucking head was caved in.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Bury her out in the desert.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Just giving the facts.
There's more.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Are you sure this was an accident?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Why?
Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
What do you think you are doing?
What are you doing?
Wait!
You don't know what you're doing.
More.
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
You want to hear me out?
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Lois please.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Nothing happened in Vegas.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
What are you talking about?
She's in there!
Great. Fine. Perfect.
That's right.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
That's right.
Yup.
Who?
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
She's not here.
What?
What is it?
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Give me two more.
What is her disposition?
I'm not talking to you?
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
I got her arm.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
But not tonight.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Fish?
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
Whatever you say Kojak.
Okay fine.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
My what?
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
That's right.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Take care of business.
Just do it.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Suck my ass.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
What you just said. Say it again.
Say it again.
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
What is the question you asked me?
What did you ask me?
He is not cracking up.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
Go ahead.
What kind of words?
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
Nobody knows she's here.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Nobody knows.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Shut up.
Shut up.
No.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
Who's up for making some real money?
Well, I didn't mean it.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Give me the Valium.
Stop.
Stop it!
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
We're not goosed.
Easy Micheal.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
Take Mexico.
There's my point exactly.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Then what do they have?
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
New king.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
Not true.
False.
I don't hate women.
Oh really? Starbucks?
Moore?
I never heard that.
The hell I did!
The hell I did!
You're a fucking moron.
