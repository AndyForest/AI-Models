We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
Don't touch her. Call 911.
I need a drink.
Excellent.
I didn't hear you.
What did you say?
What?
Go home!
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
You fucking bastard!
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
What are you fucking talking about?
The hell I don't.
I have plenty of friends.
Don't point at me.
What did you say?
This is pathetic.
It's sacrilegious.
Why?!
Why was the floor wet?
Playing?
She's dead.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
I don't have to...
Multiple reasons.
You're an asshole.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
Sorry Fish.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
I got children. I've got a life.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
I don't give a damn.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
At the seven-eleven.
I can't do this.
Fuck you Boyd!
Don't talk to me about character.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
You got us into this mess.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
I am not flexible on this.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
That is absolutely not true.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
We can't do this.
Wait. Wait a minute.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
Have you ever done this before?
What about the blood?
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
So I didn't fucking do it!
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Sure, why not.
I'm calling the police.
Just stop.
Stop it!
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
We have to call the ambulance.
Calling the ambulance.
I'm calling the ambulance.
What are you talking about?
What?
She's got no fucking pulse.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
Don't even start.
I'm not getting a ticket.
There is no candy!
Later.
What?
They're driving me nuts!
Where's the bathroom?
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
Have you thought about what I said?
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
I want you to hear me out.
It has to be done.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
If anything ever happens to me...
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
Don't eyeball your kids.
Don't ever stare him down.
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
Are you solid with that?
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
That's one idea.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
