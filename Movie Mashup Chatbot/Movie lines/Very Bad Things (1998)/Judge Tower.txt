These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
The rings?
May we have the rings please?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
What song?
Okay great. What will that be?
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
