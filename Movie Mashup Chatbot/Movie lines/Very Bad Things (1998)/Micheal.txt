You go home!
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
You're a loser.
Eat my ass!
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
The hell you do.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
You're not a team player.
You're pathetic.
Why?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
The floor was wet. She slipped!
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
Name one.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
You're an asshole Adam.
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
First of all...
I love you.
How about my Fatburger?
Goosed!
Goosed!
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
We're goosed.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Ball park sausages.
You will not screw this up.
You said nobody would miss her.
Not really, no.
They need leadership.
What?
What? What's your point?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
What's your point?
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
Israel doesn't have a King.
And what happens when you can't?
You have a King fantasy.
True.
You hate women.
Your ideas never work out.
Nope.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
The hell you didn't!
It's my fucking opinion.
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Come on.
I'll take a ride.
So?
I don't care for him.
You're not breathing right?
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
It means she's insecure.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
That's just insecurity.
I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
Right.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
It was an accident!
Drum banging real times.
