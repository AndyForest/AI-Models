Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
So where's that leave us?
Well, oh...
What does that mean?
Money?
My god.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
Move the bodies.
The only proof is those bodies.
Like how?
What does that mean?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
Call the police.
You killed a prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
Who's dead?
What are you talking about?
What kind of stupid question is that?
What?
Don't even.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
No.
Yeah. You.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
I won't even discuss it.
We're not canceling.
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
No way.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Are they fighting?
Now?
Well, can you come back inside?
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
What's the word on the chairs?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
The chairs.
What okay?
What about the chairs?
How late?
Where are you?
Hello.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Yeah. Nesting.
Just a bit of organizing.
Well you should.
That's sweet.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Hello.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Do you love me?
Will you please call the chair people?
Maybe.
Take care of those chairs.
Do you love me?
I need your help.
I need your help.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
You go down there.
Not padded ones.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Keith do not trivialize this.
Seating problems.
We've got problems here.
Kiss me...?
How much?
Do you love me?
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
I've seen it on television.
It's vile!
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
Why? What's his problem?
He's weird.
He's weird.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
Charles Moore for instants.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
He's a moron.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
Right before the wedding?
Well it's bad timing.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
Don't you dare.
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
What else have you forgot?
You can't play around with these tent people.
Why did you forget the tent check?
Why?
You forgot the tent?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Caterer?
Florist?
Photographer?
The wedding cake check?
What do you mean, you think so?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
This is ridiculous.
I do.
You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
"You Send Me."
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
A mutant species.
The stone age.
...embarrassing, shameful...
That's our plan.
We will.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
