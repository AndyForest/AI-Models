A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Let's watch some TV.
Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
Give it here, Bernard.
Hey, c'mon.
Okay.
That's okay, Mom.
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Where'd he go?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Thanks, Mom.
Whew.
Thank God.
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
RUDOLF!
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
I could take a cab on the way home.
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Shit!
It's fun.
Let's follow 'em.
God, your sister's really hot.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
No.
-- A man.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Can we keep him?
And I can't help having a cold.
The thermometer's broken.
I have a cold.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
I didn't.
No.
What about cable?
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Are we gonna buy this house?
