Mommy!
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Did Daddy tease you?
Uh huh.
Why are you mad at each other?
Uh huh.
A man scared me.
I'm thirsty.
Bye, Neil!
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
I found a cent!
