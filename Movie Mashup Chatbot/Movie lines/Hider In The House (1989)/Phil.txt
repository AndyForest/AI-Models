Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
This is my house.
What?
I think it's time I came home now.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
Look, I think we should work things out.
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Who was that?
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
There might be some extras in the garage.
<u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u> <u>showed up for our lunch</u>!  It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some --  Do you smell smoke?
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
He wasn't there.
C'mon.
What -- what are you doing?
His secretary just confirmed.
He wants to see me!
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
Did the cleaning woman come?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
The cab's waiting!
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
All new houses have noises.
No.
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
Oh -- great.
Huh?
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
He made, you know, a remark.
Did you hear what he said?
Did you hear that?
Damn.
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
How were we -- were we cool?
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
Stop knowing me so well.
What's that?
What?
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
Neil, calm down.
Get on the other side of that.
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
Do you see a man?
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
What did the thermometer say?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Neil, do you mind?
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
Do you have enough money?
Really.
Uh huh.
I'd like that.
Promise?
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Even cosier.
It's a double.
Right over here.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
