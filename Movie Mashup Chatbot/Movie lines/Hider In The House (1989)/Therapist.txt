Well, you'll just have to <u>make</u> her understand.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
Who doesn't?
A sense of proportion.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
As long as you keep remembering why.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
-- hospital.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
And the rent is okay?
How's the new place?
