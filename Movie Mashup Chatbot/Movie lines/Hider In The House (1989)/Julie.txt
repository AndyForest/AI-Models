Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
About what?
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
Uh huh.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
You must value your independence.
Do you have a family?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
Oh, that's fine.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
Everything breaks at once.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Oh, great.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
Holly -- that's not so.
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
A man?  Was it a dream?
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
Aw, okay.
Baby, what is it?
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I've asked him what's wrong.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
Honey --
Neil -- what --
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
He doesn't have a temperature.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
Here, take this out to the table.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
C'mon, kids, let's go.
We'll talk in the morning.
Oh God.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm having the floor fixed,
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
That's not the case.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Oh, honey.
What?
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Oh baby.
Philip!  The senior partner?
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
Did you lock the garage door?
Where should I hide the car keys?
I thought we'd be happy here.
Fuck you, Philip.
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Well, what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
How long does it have to be a new house?
I hear things in this house,
There's no card or anything.
Do you remember who gave us this?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
How was lunch?
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
Honey, are you okay?
What?
What?
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
We're going to think about it.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
And it's a shorter commute.
You could have a pool to cool off in.
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
But it's what we want.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Just reduced.
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
