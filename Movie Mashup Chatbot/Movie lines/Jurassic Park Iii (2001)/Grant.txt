A bird cage.
Oh, my God.
One way to find out.
This is how you play God.
Quiet!
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
NO!
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
We need to keep moving.
KEEP GOING!
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
They never got that big.
How would you classify it?
I don't think so.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
That does sound lucky.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
What?
Absolutely not.
Not if it can't dig.
You rented an automated litter box.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
A well-accepted theory.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
I'd better get going.
The last of my breed.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
To a degree we never imagined.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
You remember the sounds they made?
Raptors, mostly.
Really?  What do you do there?
He used to know me.
Hmm?
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
No we're not.
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
You're right.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
Bonitas.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Why?
We need to head for the coast.
How much of this island have you explored?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
What did you think?
Did you read Malcolm's book?
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Any weapons, radios?
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
Which one do you prefer?
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
On the island.
Eric, your parents are both here.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Billy!
Back out! Move!
But you never came across just one.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
I have never been on this island!
Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
This plane can not land!
That's hard to believe.
I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you canï¿½t fly low enough to see anything of interest.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Hmmm.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
