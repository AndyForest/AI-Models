What is it?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Eric!
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
ERRR-IIIC!
I would completely support that.
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
We should try fishing again.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
You couldn't have made that jump.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
What?...WHAT!?
Think.
When did you have it last?
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
Well what?
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
We have to help him.
He's this way.
Eric!
It�s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
No, it's...
I filmed this the morning they left.
Eric...
Just drop it Paul!
Nothing.
Nothing.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
So do you.
You hate to swim.
How much weight have you lost?
Nothing you haven't seen before.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
We can't just...
What's a bad idea?
What?
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
It is truly, what�s the word? Inspiring.
You had the phone the whole time?
What about Eric?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Just hold on.
PAUL!
