Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
Goodbye, Alan.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youï¿½re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Good luck with the fund raising.
You think they could talk to each other?
I try not to.
My favorite.
Anything good?
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
