Where is it?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that�s where he's headed.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
Here!
Who's that?
How low?
It won't hold!
Sure.
Dr. Grant was.
I don�t know.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
I CAN GET HIM!
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
ALAN!
We could co-write a paper.
It looks intact.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Baryonyx?

Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
They're here.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
How was your trip? Profitable?
