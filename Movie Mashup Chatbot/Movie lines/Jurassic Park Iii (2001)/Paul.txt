Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
You mean it?
He could have died.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
I don't remember
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
That one time was just the bumper.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it�s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
It's not safe.
Udesky.
Eric! Are you here?
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
That's him. That�s Eric!
Young adult.
What did you say!
What did you say?
What?
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
No, Dr. Grant says...
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
You look good.
People change.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Sorry.
We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
Her new boyfriend.
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
He says it's a bad idea!
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Eric!
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
I thought you were an expert.
They couldn�t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
Stan.
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Amanda!
Well that's good.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
