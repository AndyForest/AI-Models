Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called � hmmm...  � yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
Not black.
You're not?
What?
Yes, but as a black painter �
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
What are they?
Yes, I understand � but where do you take them from?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
... Can you... decipher this for us?
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?
