I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
What about the shit they write?
The whole thing � painting.
Do you ever get sick of it?
See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
Naa..
Why, so you could humiliate me?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
What do you think?
Not sure. How was yours?
I don't know.
Hey � it's the big A.M..
I'm a painter, too.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
We can do better. It needed more white.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
Piss painting?
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
What's with the wigs?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Ouch..
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
Cool.
Yeah � I'd do that... You could teach me.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors � anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Yeah, I met her already.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
You don't even work on your stuff!
Ten bucks apiece.
Yeah... Like � stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Sure.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
I know.
When?
You want a drink?
You name it, I paint there.
No.
What do you mean?
B.B. It's me � Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
Sure, ok..
I can get ten.
I'm here.
I need a dealer.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
Should there be?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Who said that?
We don't hang them at home, y'know � just in the streets..
Yup.
No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.
Not what?
I'm not black.
I use a lot of colors � not only black.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
A primate?
You mean like an ape?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
They're just words.
Decipher?
I hate this. Turn that off.
Yeah.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Chateau Latour '64, please.
What's wrong with you today?
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve � I mean Shenge.
Use your fucking instinct.
Yeah..
Still not here.
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
Paint it out.
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
I guess it was a long time ago.
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
Good. What do you have?
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
I ain't John Henry.
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
For real?
Come on in!
Check you later, man.
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
So then what?
Who's John Henry?
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Oh � you mean black people!
About what?
I am... On Gina.  Fuck � I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist � she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here � I made this for you.
Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
Oh yeah..
Who am I?
Who's that?
Willie Mays.
What's his name?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were �
George?
Forget it.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're �
How is he?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
A present I picked up for you.
Hi.
What's wrong with me?
... babies.
Think so?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee �
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
You want some?
I'm your family.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
You're back.
... What's the matter?
Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and you read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you. Although I'll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
Do you know what he's saying?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
I thought you hated this place?
Party girls? Can I call you?
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
Can I walk you home?
I guess you did.
I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar � I'll get the rest.
I'll take the whole tin.
Is that the best quality you have?
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
What's your name, man?
Sure. I'd be glad to.
That's great.
Me? Why?
See you later.
Stand still.
You like your dad's paintings?
Hi.
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
Have a Mac.
Wanna Mac?
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
Hey, Rene.
I'll make you another one.
I can't. After the show.
That one's for you.
What time is it?
So what?
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Jean Michel Basquiat.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
I didn't know.
You don't have any!!!
'Phillips head,' right?
Yeah.
A what?
