I really think you should talk to him about this.
You should talk to him about this.
Aren't they?
No.
Who?
Who is it?
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
I don't believe it, Jean � they're picking straws.
That is amazing. What year is it?
What's that about?
Pretty much the same.
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but � whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
Don't you think he's using you?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
What's that?
Hi.
You're your own baby.
You mean babies with you?
It looks done.
Staten Island would be ok.
I hadn't thought about it.
Well thanks!
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
It's Monday morning.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
What who's saying?
You don't have any fucking money..
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
You do! You definitely do.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
I think I could do that alone.
Guess I just got sick of him.
No, don't tell me � you just got fired by your crazy boss.
I need this?
I just don't think you're being fair.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
