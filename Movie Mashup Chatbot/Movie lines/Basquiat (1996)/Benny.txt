She's good.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
I don't really have any problems.
Good.
What's the rush, John Henry?
You gonna carry that around all night?
We got beat.

Hi Gina.
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?
Oh man! Folklore guy � worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry � fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Your people.
You're shattering all my myths.
Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
You got a date already?
Thanks.  Your dad called again � something about a job.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
SAMO.
