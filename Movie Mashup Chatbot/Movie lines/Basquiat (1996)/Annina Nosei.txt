I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
How much for these five?
These are great.
Is Jean Michel here?
Annina Nosei.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Jean, your parents are here.
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
How about right now?
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
You haven't been by lately.
