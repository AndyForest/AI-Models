I know that. Don't let him get away.
MOTHAFUCKAH!
Just look at him.  Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
Who did this?  Who did this?
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
Forget it.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother � when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
5:11.
So shut up and keep painting..
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
So keep painting.
My point exactly.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts � you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
