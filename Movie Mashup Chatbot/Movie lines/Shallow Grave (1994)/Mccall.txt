Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
I see.
Just one thing.
Sorry to waste your time.
That's it, then.
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
What?
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Take another look at these two.
Well, then?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
What does it look like?
This is just an informal discussion.
That wasn't a question.
You're sure of that.
Is this where no one stays?
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Two?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
did you hear anything before he cries?
Can we come in?
Downstairs.
It's about the burglary.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Look again if you like.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
Or a fake?
Your watch.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
