Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
What?
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Except the money.
They know.
But they know.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
Your friends.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
You looking for me?
I want to secure it.
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
Not eating what?
Nothing.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
What? Yes, that's fine.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
Doesn't it worry you?
There was a break-in.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
Security.
How much?
How much did you pay?
How much did you pay?
You think so?
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
Now.
I want to talk now.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
Can we talk about something?
Is this necessary?
Is that going to be deep enough?
Finished.
I don't know.
I just thought we should discuss it.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
I won't be able to.
I can't do it.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
You know what I'm talking about.
No, not that.
So who's going to do it?
And what about you?
When are you going to let the police know?
He's still here.
You think so?
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You mean immoral.
No.
No.
No.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
No.
Alex, I don't have the time --
Only on expenses.
He made it clear.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
I don't have time.
About what?
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
I haven't lost yet.
Will you shut up and play.
What?
Just serve.
Serve.
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
All right, just a few questions.
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
Yes.
No, I've never seen them.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Someone lost the key.
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
I see.
Yes, absolutely.
No, three. Who said there were four?
Who said there were four?
There are only two other people in the flat.
Of course.
No, nothing, sorry.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
Of course.
Burglary?
What about?
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
And you need your sleep.
You and me?
We already know. All about it.
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd gone to work.
If I think you're lying --
Who have you talked to?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
Expecting anyone?
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Two hundred pounds?
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
I'm sorry.
Do you know many of these people?
No.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Is this what they always look like?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Did you ever kill a man?
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
Do you smoke?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
I'm boring?
Yes, sir.
I'm not sure --
Eh --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Exactly what I was --
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Right here?
Sorry?
