I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Where do you think you'll go?
About the mail --
Yeah?
Not at all.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
So I gathered.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
I beg your pardon?
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who?
We just wanted to speak to you.
Looking for you? Yes.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
You're not eating.
What's wrong?
You're sure? There's lots more.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
What's all this for, more security?
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
What is this?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
After.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
What's the problem?
Just stop worrying.
Not now. I have an idea.
That was good.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Don't you worry about that.
But not quite.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Take his legs.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
I don't hear this.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
Then what? Who's going to do what?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
You call them if you want.
He couldn't get his car started.
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
Juliet?
Come on, David.
Think about it.
Can I show you something?
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Have you seen him?
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
Why, thank you, David.
I'm only asking what you think.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
What do you think?
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
You're a bad loser.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
In the same fashion as chess.
I was trying to educate you.
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
What's his name?
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
I don't know.
But there's no --
Cover it?
I don't know anything about it.
Right.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
Yes.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
That's all?
Parked outside?
Well, is it?
Yes, I suppose so.
I don't know them.
I've never seen any of these men before.
No. Why should it?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Are you recording it?
Is this being recorded?
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
And you like it?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
What?
Let him go. Let him take it all.
No.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
The perfect couple, I should say.
That's what I thought he said.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
Are you all right?
What?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
You'll wait in the hall?
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
I refuse.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
Oh.
Expecting anyone?
Now you thought of that, not me.
We could put it somewhere.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Later. But first -- him.
We have to talk.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
He can't stay up there.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
You know we're right.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
It tastes different.
No, no, it's different.
Will you calm down.
No.
Who was it?
You were magnificent.
Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
What's he doing here?
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Love and happiness for ever.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
David?
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
And now you tell me.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I thought we all were.
Is that all?
What?
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
Don't look?
I'm just looking.
What? What's wrong?
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
I wonder how he did it?
All right. No problem.
Now?
You want me to kick it open?
So?
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
What sort of car?
He's got a car?
Hugo.
Maybe he didn't like us.
David hasn't seen him either.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
You see, they don't really know me.
I think you're lying.
Know and love?
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
-- which is a hack.
What I am.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
I'm not usually drunk.
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
Aroused and inflamed.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Well, she had problems --
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
Did you know --
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
Really?
Cameron?
Can you afford this place?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
It's OK. There's no problem.
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
What?
So, uh...
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
Interesting.
