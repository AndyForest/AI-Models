Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Don't you ever stop?
You mustn't take it so badly.
It's about me and David.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
We were just sorting things out.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Alex.
Everything.
I'll wait there.
You're frightened.
It's the only way.
Aren't you going to answer it?
No.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Where he can't get it?
And the money?
Forget it.
Oh, good.
David?
Your painful groin?
What are you doing here?
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Leave him alone.
I don't see the point in that.
Don't you?
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Then let's spend some money.
Are you all right?
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Hello. Hello.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
That's not him.
No, I don't.
Who?
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
For ever and ever.
Sshh.
Stop nagging.
Be careful.
OK.
I don't want to. It's different.
I don't thinkI can.
Who's going to do it?
Unfeasible.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
No.
Don't.
What are you doing?
Alex.
Did what?
Yes.
Yes.
Open it.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
So what's wrong with that?
His car's still there.
David?
So I gathered.
Have you seen Hugo?
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
You're right.
Yeah.
The man we know and love.
-- which is --
-- instead of what he is --
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
Not usually this drunk.
Alex.
So we'll meet him, then?
Who was it?
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
She hated you --
For the flat.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
I thought you stopped going.
Just serve.
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
Yes.
Cameron.
It wasn't like that.
What?
Eh, I don't know.
Yes.
So let's go.
It was on the television.
I should hope so.
With a face like this?
No one.
No one. I promise.
No.
What?
That's what it cost, David.
Two hundred pounds.
Two hundred.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Yes. They're my friends.
Would you like to talk about it?
Are you all right?
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Yes.
Just get on with it, Alex.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
Why do you want a room here?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
Here?.
What guy that died?
What guy?
Hello.
And that's not the same thing?
You know about it?
A certain weakness.
No. But he needs treatment.
I'm a doctor.
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
It's an improvement.
Did he sound upset?
No.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
Do you think you could answer that?
Writing seems easy.
No.
I see.
What's it about?
What do you do?
Would you like to see the rest?
Would you like to come in?
You must be Hugo.
The first one was fine.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
What?
That sounds fine.
Sorry?
I suppose so.
Diseases.
Yes.
Same as everyone else.
No. I haven't seen them.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
