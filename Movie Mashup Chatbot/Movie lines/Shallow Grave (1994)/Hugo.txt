Yeah.
You mean I can have the room?
You were going to say something.
What?
I see.
No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
I write about it?
The human condition.
For what?
And he's a patient of yours?
Working nights?
Shall I answer it?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
It was some guy called Brian.
All right.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
It's a breeze.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
A priest who dies.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
It's nice.
I'd be delighted.
You must be Juliet.
