Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
I hate being lectured.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Adam and Evil.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
You lie!
Where is my wife?
You will rescue my wife
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
Dear daisy, don't despair.
No gun.  How disarming.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Impressive
I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
I find that unlikely.
