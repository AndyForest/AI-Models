Alfred's happy here.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
What are you talking about?
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
You'd be surprised.
Hey, what's your problem?
Keep it.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
Please be looking for me.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
And she did it all for me.  For love.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Like hell you do.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
But he's never said a word-
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
What happened to his wife?
That's gotta hurt.
