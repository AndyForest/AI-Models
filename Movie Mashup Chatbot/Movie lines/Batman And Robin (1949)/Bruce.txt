Alfred, are you...?
What is it?
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Pheromones?
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Women.
It's good to see you.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
I love you, old man.
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
Not all heroes wear masks.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
But I can't can I?
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
Thanks.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
You have?
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
You are going back to school.
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
I recognized the accent.
Oxbridge Academy?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
Well...um...her.
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
I wish I knew.
What?
I wouldn't bet on that.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
Can I get some help over here?
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
I knew you could handle it.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
She wants to kill you.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Dick, don't push me right now.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
