You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Who's Ivy?
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
You're not even listening to me.
And?
But soon...
No!?
