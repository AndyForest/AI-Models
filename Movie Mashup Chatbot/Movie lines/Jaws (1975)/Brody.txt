Here --  Take him home.
Just a favor for your old man.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
I want him out of the ocean.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
He's taken him!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
He's trying to sink us!
Have you ever had one do this?
What about us?
Did you get him in the head?
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
That's it! Radio in for help!
Where...?
What's that one, there?
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
The wire's showing!
You got it?
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
Who's driving the boat?
You got it.
It's my charter. My party.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
This is Matt Hooper...
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
You got it.
You got it.
You got it.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
What?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Colorful, isn't he?
No. Home here.
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
You too, sweetheart...
How come you have to tell them that?
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
Michael! Come inside!
Where is he?
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Love ya.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know -� sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Feed the dogs.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Probably out in the back yard.
Right.
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Just sign it, Larry.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
Got a pen on you?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
He lost it on the way up.
I'm going home.
She's right.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Sure he is.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
I didn't agree to that!
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
Now tell me something I don't know.
Do I need any more authority?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Think the tide's with us?
What day is this?
No...  You think we can get back with those?
I can't stand here doing nothing!
What the hell?
What's that, a ship?
This has got to be one big violation...
I wish it would rain...
Wait a minute! I need you.
That means closing the beaches.
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
No shark did that to a boat!
You all right?
Be careful, for chrissake.
Why don't we just tow it in?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
What happened?
We gotta get back soon...
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
Where'd you get all this?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
What is all this stuff?
Chum?
What do we do?
He ate a car?
How can you tell?
What? What?!
What's that?
What stinks so bad?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Let's all have a drink.
Swell.
What d'ya mean?
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
No, we just checked the beach...
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Who are you?
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Pretty stiff.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
You here for the summer?
You from around here?
Think she might've run out on you?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
You picked her up on the ferry.
Christine what?
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
That wasn't funny.
Get out of there � take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
I'm responsible for public safety around here...
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
What else could've done that?
