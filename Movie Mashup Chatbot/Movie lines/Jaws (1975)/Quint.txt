He's comin' up -- !
Full throttle! To port!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
No!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Shut up! Just pump her out!
The bilge pumps. There --
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
I almost had 'im.
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
I never saw one that big.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
What do you mean 'We...?'
I know who he is...
Try some of this. I made it myself.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
And incidental damages, if any...
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
Did you bring a check?
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
He's busy.
This is Quint, Missus.
What can that gun of yours do?
Follow him!
No way! He can't!
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Easy! It'll tear right out!
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
And I'll drink to yours.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
Over there!
Fasten the pole.
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
Down here, Hooper!
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Who's inside, you or the shark?
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Let me see your hands...
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Transplants?
