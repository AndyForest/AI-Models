What'll I tell the kids?
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
You going to be all right?
Home... New York?
Can you do that?
Thank you.
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
It's three feet deep, Martin
He's sitting in it.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Can you stand something to eat?
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
Be careful.
Older, sillier.
I think they make you look sexy.
Don't forget these.
Don't be silly -ï¿½ You're going to make summer better for them...
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
I never hear the whistle.
Like you're from N'Yawk.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
Do you see the kids?
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Is that a boat?
You're leaving?
You love sharks?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
So would I. Come on in.
