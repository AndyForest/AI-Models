We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
Our data is being prepared.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
The information will not be disclosed.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
<U>Why</U>?!
<U>Why</U>...?!
The examination is a normal function.
Who is V'ger?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
Engineering...
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Departure angle on viewer.
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
No!
, if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
<U>Computer off</U>!
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
Mr Decker....
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Granted.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
You saved the ship.
Then you acted properly, of course.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Programming ready?
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Yes.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
Viewer, standard ahead.
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Mr. Spock?
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Time to impact...?
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Hold station...!
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Viewer ahead.
Hold relative position here...
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Hold station.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
The point...
There is no alternative.
Not for us?
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Child...!?
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
What answers?
What should you have known?
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
They had a pattern to follow...
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
Mr. Decker... ?
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Our... 'insignificance'?
Any reply from them?
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
And whatever you sensed out here....
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
I want him here.  Sit down!
Sit down, please.
I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Why aren't you on board?
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
