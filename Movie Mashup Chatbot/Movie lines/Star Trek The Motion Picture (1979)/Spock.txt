Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator.
V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
A tractor beam...
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
This served the purpose.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Precisely.
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
