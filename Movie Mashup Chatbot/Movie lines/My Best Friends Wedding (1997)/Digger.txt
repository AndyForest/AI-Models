Part of being a New Yorker.
I honestly wish I could...
What?
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
Something like that.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.

Oh, you're more than okay.
Good girl.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
To belong to someone.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.

I have a suggestion...
We're about to find out.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
Desperate.  To talk.
Blood oath.

Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
He's still in love with you.
Kindred spirits.
The wandering sportswriter.
... weeks.

Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
