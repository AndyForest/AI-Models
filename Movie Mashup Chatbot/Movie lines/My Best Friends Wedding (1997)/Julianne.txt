I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
I did what I came to do.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
And what will he do?
Needing.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
Major.  Dish.
It's too late to start over.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I can't even say it.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
That was Thursday.
Try less appropriate.
I wish.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
Let's not get carried away.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
Sure.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
I was devastated.
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
You're butting in.
You flew all the way h...
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
We'll never be the same.
He can't do that to me!
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
You think...
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
I never want to go through this again.
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
Uh, Kimmy...?
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Only.  If he wants to.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
Exactly.
Hello.
Gold nose hair clippers.
... whatever is manly and independent.
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
Jesus, we're trapped!
I've missed a step.
I was gonna predict that.
No.
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
Let me rephrase that...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
How about...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
Don't you have to be somewh...
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
What else did he tell you...
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
Can you watch the road?
Excuse me?
You need a few dollars.
Well, we're...
You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
Ex-cuse me?
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I saw the show.
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
... unless he has a hump.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Nobody has.  So far.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
I think he's been fired.
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
Is anybody watching?
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
That's little egotistical.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
That is so romantic.
It's two weeks.
Why would she come here...
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Lower.
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
DON'T SPEAK!
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
Shhh.
The Big Hurt, huh?
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
... your one chance for true happiness?
Well, it happens.
Oh, yeah.
Does that make it right...
She admits it's her fault.
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
And your point?
Get married, apparently.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Michael...
A bad combination.
What happened?
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
Michael? What ha...
... maybe it's congratulations.
It means a lot.
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
That's my point!!
I'm up against a deadline.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Yes.
No accents today.
Well.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
The night we met.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Me either.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
You've been the man in mine.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
Have you.
If you like.
You miss her, huh?
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
You keep saying that.
Like I said, dazzling.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Michael!!
Never can tell.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Boy, those were the days.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
I never eat when I'm serene.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Should I whistle down a cab?
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
Waiter! Check, please!
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
Quite the little eccentric.
Endearingly absent-minded.
What's next?
Hate that.
Such as.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
What's the sec...
W...
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
... Thomas, yeh.
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
You've met her parents.
Well, sure.
Well, somet...
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
