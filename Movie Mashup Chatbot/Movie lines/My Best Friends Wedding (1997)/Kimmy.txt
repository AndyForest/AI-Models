That's entirely understandable.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
I love him.
... that this is all my fault?
Don't you see...
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
I just don't want to freak him out.
He won't get mad, huh?
He'll see right through it.
Exactly what?
So... one almost has to...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
For the twins? What in the world is th...
But he always says...
I mean, he loves his job.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
About Michael's job.
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
Ju...
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
You win.
And the answer was so simple.
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
... except one.
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
And loving him means loving all of this.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
But he sure can kiss.
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
He said that, too.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
But I can't be dry.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
MICHAEL!!
Well, if that's the way you f...
What is that sup...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
And to m...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
The most important thing. Is being together.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
