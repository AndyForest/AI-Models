Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
And if I don't obey?
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
Then -
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
You've been doing some research in the archives.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.

Lara, please...
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
How good it felt!
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Enjoyed it?
