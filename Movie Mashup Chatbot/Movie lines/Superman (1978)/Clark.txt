What's she doing in California?
Lois isn't here?
It was hot, yes.
I've been on the job.
I will.
North. It's north
Mother...
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Mom...
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
You're not the only one.
No thanks.
Super...man. Hmmm...
Is that what they're calling him?
What'd you call him?
Jealous? Of what?
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
Come again?
Can I take you to the airport?
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Don't you ever give up?
Oh.
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Huh?
I just took a shot at it.
Know what?
Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
He may have a gun!
What the  --  !
Unbelievable.
But otherwise it's swell.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Not really, no.
Not really, no.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
No.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
I'd like to.
