Okay.  Take me to your leader.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
I'd better get you down.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Besides that.
What are you doing here?
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Listen...thank you.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Twenty-four.
How good it felt -
No! You couldn't imagine -
I guess I got carried away
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Very much.
Sure.
Pink.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Uh-huh.
What about it?
195 pounds.
Thirty-five.
It's not bad.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
I guess they are a little odd.
You think they're strange?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
I came to talk to you.
Right on the first guess.
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Do as I say. Let go!
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
We'll see how fast I can fly.
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
They'll soon be over.
Luthor  --
On radio waves?
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Of time, Luthor.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
But...why?
What is this??!
