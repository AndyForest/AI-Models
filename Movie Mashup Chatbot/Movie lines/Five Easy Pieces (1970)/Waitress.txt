You want me to hold the chicken.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
I don't make the rules.
Would you like to talk to the manager?
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
No. We have tomatoes.
No substitutions.
Five'll do it.
Can I get you anything else?
