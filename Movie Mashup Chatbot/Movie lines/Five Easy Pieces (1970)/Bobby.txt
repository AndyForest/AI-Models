Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
A wig?
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Twinky?
I leave it to you.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Fill it up.
No.
No, let's go...
Come on.
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
I don't, huh?
Just finish eating.
Rayette.
I don't know.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Sure...
Okay, Ray...
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
Who said I was depressed?
Is what you?
No.
Shut up! All of you!
What?
What the hell is that?
I love it.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
Now, hand...
I'm sorry.
I know you're not.
I'm going on over there...
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
You just going to sit there?
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
You got another ball comin'.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
That's right, hand.
You can sing the song.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
Now, now.
Cerveza.
You're playing the other side.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
You said.
No.
You're not going to play it again.
I didn't get it, did I?
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
Well...
Who?
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
How do you know it's clean?
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
Where are you going?
Washington.
What's your name?
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
No. How much do I owe you?
Well, you seem very professional...
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Am I on TV?
Wasn't it, ladies?
Bye, now.
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
I'm talking to you, Tita!
Where's Catherine?!
Where is she, anyway?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
I think he's got a terrific personality.
Yeah, well, he's...
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
Look at that.
No, thanks...
What?
I don't know.
There's nothing to say, Tita...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Uhm hmm.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Sort of.
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
Sometimes.
What questions?
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
Uhm hmm. Some range.
How long have you been staying here?
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
Tita, I've got to go...
Yeah, me, too...
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
Maybe you better stay, then.
Well...  I better let you...
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
No...
Yeah... I guess so...
Don't tell me about this...
Oh, well, what, what's he...
What?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Who's Van Oost?
Everybody still up on the Island?
Very nice.
No kidding.
No.
Oh.
Sorry.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Don't, then.
That's good.
Now don't...
Hi, Tita.
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
That'll make you happy.
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Just give me a chance, will you?
Catherine...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Yes, it is!
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
I have to talk to you.
Where are you going?
Of course I'd like to.
What?
Yeah, I think I could.
Is he?
I'm fine.
That's what you said?
That's right.
Shut up...
Serious, that's what's important to you?
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Some bath oil?
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
No, it isn't what I think.
You think I'm a fake.
Catherine...
What?
Wait...
None.
I didn't have any.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Thank you.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
I gave it a second thought.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
The day after tomorrow.
Tomorrow, then.
Then after that?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Nothing.
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
That's dangerous, you know.
I guess you fell in the water.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
You're all full of shit!
Oh, for chrissakes...
I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
That's three games to none, Carl.
At game, Carl.
That's what I mean...
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
What?
Thanks, Carl...
Is she?
What?
Four or five years.
It's all right. I'm fine.
No, it's okay.
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
