Robert, I think you better just...
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
All right, let's have a rematch.
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.

Robert, do you mind?
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.

It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?

It's a Borzoi.
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
Not at all.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.

At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
It is true.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
