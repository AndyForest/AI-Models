Bye, Robert.
But what about me?
You were going without saying goodbye?
You're leaving?
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
I don't know where she is!
It's none of your business!
My turn.
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Why are you being so mean?
With applesauce?
Do you want some gingerbread?
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Like what?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
It's not that bad.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
A couple of months.
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
All right...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Wait...
I know.
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
He's had two strokes.
Daddy's very ill.
Robert, I have to tell you something...
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Robert...
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
You know who it once belonged to?
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
You always do this to me.
I just can't look at you.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Robert Eroica...
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Tea.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
I hope I didn't hear that.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
Besides being very rude.
I don't think that's true.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Yes.
