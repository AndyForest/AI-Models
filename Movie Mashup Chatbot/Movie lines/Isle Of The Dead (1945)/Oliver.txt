Goodbye.
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
Well ��
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
I'll go up and take a look at the General �- perhaps sit with him.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk ��	he staggered.
Drunk again?
He is exhausted.
You collect these to sell, abroad?
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
Poor Cathy --
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
On my word! That's what they believe.
Where's Thea?
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
I think not.
Sleep well.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
Come �- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
When you make sense I'll listen.
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle �-
And I'm your friend �� but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
I had a notion you had become self�appointed chaperone lately � why?
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
How did she die?
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
We still don't know that it's the plague ��
But the war, the army �� they need you.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
I can't understand that.
But that should make you like her.
Oh, now �� now look here ��
Thea?
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt �� after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
Do you mind if I go with you?
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -�
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" �-
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Why in the world can't you?
Well, tell, him.
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble �� the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
Thea, what's wrong?
You see? Thea believes it, too!
Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Everything's so simple. I like you.
You're crying. Why?
