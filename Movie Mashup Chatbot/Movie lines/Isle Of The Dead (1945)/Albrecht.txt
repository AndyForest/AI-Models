Where is Miss Wollsten?
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -� the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
May life be good to you both. As for the others �� they will be quiet here �� and I will be with them.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
In case you do so, would you --
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently �� walked blindly.
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
I need your advice �� something has happened �� Mr.  Jacks ��
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
My friend -- what can one say --
) You feel the symptoms?
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
We will see who is the first to die.
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
Good winds and bad winds!
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was �- perhaps it was.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ��people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
There was some trouble here ��the villagers on the mainland �-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ��broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
They were gore before I came here.
This was once a cemetery.
