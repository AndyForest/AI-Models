No.  She shall not be left here.
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I donut understand.
All the graves?
But why?
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
They shall not hurt you
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then �- I'll not die �� I'll watch -� they shall not hurt you.
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill �� or frightened.
I was looking for you.
How old is she?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
I don't understand you.
Yes?
He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
Woman, what are you doing here?
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I will go with you.
This girl --
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
What is her illness?
Your daughter is ill.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Her family name?
Her name is Thea?
Daughter -- my daughter --
Theodosia --
I shall not leave the island ��
I have had command for the last time �-
Listen to what I say --
If I told you �� you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you �� the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -�
You are my friend.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back ��pale -- sick -- she died --
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
Thea is so like her �� in every feature ��
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
I've seen men die drunk �- and I've seen men die of the plague.
We have no time for that.
It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
It makes me fear her.
I know all you are going to say �-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -�there is something about her ��the way she moves �� the way she turns her head.
There is something evil about her.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ��
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in �- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me �� a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
There's no one there -� nothing but the caves and the dead.
You were at those battles as a spectator � � I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me �� those men out there �� dead or dying �� by my order -- because I willed it so.
You know that sound, Oliver?
Hero?
