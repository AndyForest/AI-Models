She's in her room.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
I don't know now without my father.
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Closer and closer �- until they bite into your throat!
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Oh, no -� it's too delicious! You're making it up!
I think she went to bed �� I saw her going toward the house
No one can take my father's place.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Good night, Oliver.
Thank you.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
Shh��� it's all right -� I'll be all right.
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
What are you doing?
She has never mentioned her family.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
That should decide it or you --
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
The General � you don't even know him.
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
I have forgotten it, dear.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
What an odd question!
Thea is an orphan.
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer �� a correspondent of some sort ��
Wouldn't I?
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people �- a cataleptic!
Really, this is idiotic!
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
No. I mean your other secret -�	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
What if he is?
What would I be thinking?
You were father's secretary -� I never thought - -
How do you know what my father thought - -
Miss Wollsten!
Whet do you mean?
