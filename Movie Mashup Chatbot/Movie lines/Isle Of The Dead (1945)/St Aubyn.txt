This girl -- Thea �- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
Why -- no not before Thea came ��
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
She's not too well.
Miss Wollsten -� my secretary, she'd know.
Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
Theodosia.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice�Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
