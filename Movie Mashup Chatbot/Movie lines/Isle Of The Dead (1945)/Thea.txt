It was, the plague
She is dead � at peace.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
I felt he did not like me.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now �- I don't know ��
But one must love a father.
My last name is Pherides.
You have forgotten my last name?
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -�or just because he is one's father?
Cathy �- how does it feel to have a father?
You are fortunate in your father.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it �- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
It is for that he hates me.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
He hates all my race.
I can't.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
The General threatened me.
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
