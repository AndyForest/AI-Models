You wouldn't tell that ��
You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man � � working at him � � turning him against Thea.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours �� but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
That your father and I ��
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you �- I'll warn them against you.
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints �� the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ��young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ��you've ruined mine ��
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed � everytime you can't get your own way.
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are �� a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live �- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure �- quite sure.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep �- I want to avoid it.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in �- entombed �� imprisoned..
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell ��
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
