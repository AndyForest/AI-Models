Mike...
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Anything?
To do what?
What else?
Like what?
How?
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
I thought I was going to die.
You too?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Why? You're not a real man?
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Hi.
