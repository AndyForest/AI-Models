Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
I can call back...
Are you on the other line?
Hi, Mike?
...well, it suits you...
...Which one...?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
Well, I should be getting...
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
It's not going to well?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
You're a comedian?
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
I'll be around.
Me too.
Well... This is it.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
