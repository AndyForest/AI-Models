Let me just check on my boy.
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Oh. He's got it under control...
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
What the fuck..?
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
No...
A day.
No, baby!
We're not messing with you...
What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
We got the digits, baby.
She didn't see.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
Was I money?
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
You looked right at her, baby.
What are you doing?
Minnie Pearl.
It's on.
...It looked money.
...through the kitchen...
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
Who? Rob?
It starts at eight...
Aww... He got away?
Yeah.
No. Doesn't that suck?
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
What?!?
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
How?
Michelle went for you, right.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
She thought you were money.
No, baby. You're money.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Hold on.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
What?
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
I'm telling you!
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Yes!
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Baby, we're money.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
...Baby...
Baby, you did fine.
Nice, baby.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
...gotta...
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
I know she's coming back.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She smiled, baby.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
Mikey's the big winner.
Who's the big winner?
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Always.
Always, baby.
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
You gotta do it.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
Double down.
You think they're watching?
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
We're gonna get laid, baby.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
Did she, or did she not smile?
She smiled baby.
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
Wake up, baby.
Vegas.
Vegas, baby!
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
What?
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Tonight, baby.
We're going to Vegas.
VEGAS.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
Hello?
Our little baby's growing up...
...Okay, two...
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
The bear's got his claws back.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
...it is so on.
It's on.
It's on...
Sue!
...Shut up, Sue...
...Sue...
...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Anaheim...
You dick.
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Yeah.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
Now go over there and get those digits.
...you're money...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
It's on.
What was cold about it?
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
See, baby?
Is she looking now?
Now?
Is she looking at me, baby?
Oh, it's on, baby...
What a surprise...
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
You could make their heads bleed, though.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
...against the computer.
Because he's a bitch.
Chelios to Roenick...!
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
