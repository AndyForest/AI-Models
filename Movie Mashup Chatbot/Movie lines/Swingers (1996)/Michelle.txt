Goodbye. I lov...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
I heard you might be moving back...
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
I miss you, Mike.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
You know, us.
Yeah.
Good.  I think about things.
How are you doing?
How's it going? It's been a while...
