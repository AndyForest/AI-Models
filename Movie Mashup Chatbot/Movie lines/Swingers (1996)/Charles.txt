...then ask where you met her...
They're out of Glenlivet.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
...and even then...
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
Oh. You know.
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
You haven't told then, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Hi.
