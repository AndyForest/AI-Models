Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
...People get carjacked...
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
She was cute.
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
Rejected?
How's it going for you two?
Damned if I know...
...He's derivative...
What's he do?
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
Pause it.
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
It's kinda money, actually.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
You little bitch!
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
...just be smart about it.
You don't have to wait three days...
Be smart about it.
...Definitely...
Sorry man.
It is on.
...it's definitely on.
...it's on.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
You're money.
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...honestly...
...you're like a big bear.
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...You're just poking at it...
...shivering...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...we're not...
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
True.
...double diamond...
You think?
That was pretty cold, dude.
Yes she did.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
No.
No.
...It's on.
...How novel.
...Is he brown?
Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
They're a finesse team...
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Bitch... You little bitch!
