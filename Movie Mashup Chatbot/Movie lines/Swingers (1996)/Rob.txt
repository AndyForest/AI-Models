...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
...Four days..?
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
No.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
My pleasure.
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
Sure.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
Well, you're doing so well...
Well, that's dumb.
She wasn't your type anyway.
Oh boy.
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
You want to talk about it?
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
I'll be your winger.
Go for it, man.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
It's unbelievable.
Him?
Oh, like that song...
What's that guy's name? Sue?
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
I just tested for one...
There's the rub.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Darwinism at its best.
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
Bud.
Classy.
Sounds more like Aids...
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Oh.  Where is this place?
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
An eight.
I'll give you an eight.
How many strokes?
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
I do. Good for you, man.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
Oh no?
Kinda.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
I didn't want to say anything.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
It's definitely a step back for me.
I mean, I need the money.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
No problem.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
There's the rub.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
It sucks.
Right.
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right.
Right.
You don't call.
