Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
Shut up.
Shuddup.
No. Stop, come on.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
It didn't feel that way.
I don't know about that.
You're right. I know.
I know, I know.
Shit.
Thank you, Nikki.
Well, thank you...?
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Yeah.
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Thanks.
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Oh... a Cavalier.
I'm sorry?
How are you ladies doing this evening?
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Uh, if the guy wants to.
Anything.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
What what? What advantages?
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
It does.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Yeah.
Tell me about it...
How was it hard?
Just like that?
Not lately.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
I like quiche.
Like the quiche?
I'm Mike.
Hi.
Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"?
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
What else is going on?
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
...you might get cut out.
...not until you book it...
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
Charles! What's up, man?
I'm a comedian.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Could you believe it?
Do you have anything smaller?
Sure, that'll be fine.
Huh?
Oh... right.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Sorry?
Sorry, it's just that...
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Six years.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Why not?
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
No...
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
Hi. Sorry about that.
No, no. Hold on.
Yeah, hold on.
Lorraine?
Hello?
...get the hell outta here already...
...The red piece of shit over there...
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...It's really getting late.
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar?
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Yeah. And an actor.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
I would love to see you again sometime.
Listen. I had a great time.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
Hi.
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
...the Michelin commercial...
Why didn't you call?
Really?
I thought you met someone else.
What kind of things?
Yeah?
Fine... I guess. You?
...Six months.
You always know the right thing to say.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
You miss the pain?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
Then why won't she call...?
I didn't make it...
They turned you down?
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
What's dumb about it?
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
I'm such an asshole.
Uuuuugh!
What's the point?
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
No. Just O.J.
Thanks, man.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
I got to at least try once.
There are so many beautiful women here.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Well, let's hit that party.
...yeah, a month ago.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
Ah, there's the rub...
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
I'll get a Dewars rocks...
Kinda money, huh?
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
What'd you get?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
You want to hit the town tonight?
I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead. Play it out.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
I didn't mention her once today.
I don't talk about her that much.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Why?
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
What do you want? You're tall.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's a gig.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
There's the rub.
Unless she comes back first.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Well that sucks.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
So what's the difference?
So I don't call either way.
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
She's really special, guys.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
What are they doing here?
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
You live in such a fantasy world...
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
You asshole.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
I can't believe you.
Not well.
Who threw this party, anyway?
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
He's trying to be an actor.
So, what? Eleven?
Give me the money. I'll get it.
Make someone bleed.
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
Wow, I guess you were home...
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all...
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike.
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679...
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
It's not like that...
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
So, two days?
Tomorrow?
How long do I wait to call?
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
Please, don't mess with me right now...
What a surprise.
That doesn't matter.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
I'm sorry.
She didn't notice.
What?
Which one?
How you guys doing?
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
...the Copa, in New York...
Yeah. You met him once.
What time's this party tonight?
You guys are such assholes.
No.
What? That was the best part of the old game.
This version doesn't have fighting?
I hear she's getting real fat.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
He drives a carriage.
Selling scrap metal.
...a day...
Don't remind me.
I just need some time...
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
That was different.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Yeah, a good friend.
I don't think so.
She didn't like me, anyway.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
She was hot.
Christy was nice...
Sorry about interrupting...
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
I gotta use the phone.
No, man. I need to use the phone.
So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?
...So give me the fuckin part...
No! Not the camera guy!
No!
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
What was the part?
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
Whatever.
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
We didn't do so bad after all.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
I know. I know.
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
That's bullshit.
I don't know...
She likes you.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
You think so?
I don't think so.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
That was so demeaning...
What an asshole.
What an asshole.
Let's go.
Let's just leave.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Yea, how much?
Thanks for clarifying that.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
I know, but...
What?!?
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
That's where we make our scene.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
It doesn't matter...
That's not cool.
Cut that shit out.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
They're all skanks.
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
Whu?
Vegas.
Vegas!
Vegas!
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Wait.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
I'm not going to Vegas.
You're crazy.
When?
What Vegas?
What are you talking about? Vegas?
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
I don't know...
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
I don't know...
S'up Trent?
