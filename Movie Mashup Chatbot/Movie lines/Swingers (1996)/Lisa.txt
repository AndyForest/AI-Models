I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
...And she's with someone else.
Oh my God.
I'm a "Dorothy".
No matter what... like splitting aces.
I understand.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
It's a rebound.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
What do you do, Trent?
Well, who represents you back east?
Who's your booking agent?
Why not?
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
