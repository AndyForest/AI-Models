All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
If she paid you well?
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Someone is sitting in that window.
Anyone at home?
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
She isn't still here, is she?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
And when she left, she never came back.
Cash or check? For the cabin...
How did she pay you?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Back where?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
Or arrived with her.
No one met her?
Of which morning?
How early?
Tell me all about her.
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
Look at the picture. Please.
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
I'm not the police.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
No.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Must've needed it.
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Money.
Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.  Where is she, Miss Crane?
Let's all talk about Mary.
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Casharoonie!
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
