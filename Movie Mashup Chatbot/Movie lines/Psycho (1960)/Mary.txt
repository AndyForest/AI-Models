I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
All right.
Five hundred.
Of course not. Please.
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
How much?
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
Can I trade in my car and take another?
What?
I don't need pills... just sleep.
Were there any calls?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
Don't miss your plane.
I'm thinking of it.
I'll lick the stamps.
Sam, let's go get married.
I haven't even been married once yet!
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
Sam! No!
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
No.
I have to go, Sam.
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
Can you?
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
Sam. This is the last time.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
Sam!
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Good night.
Crane.
Very early. Dawn.
I'd like to, but...
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
Norman.
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
No, not like me.
Why don't you go away?
Except you.
She sounded strong...
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
You should... mind it.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
Why do you ask that?
I'm looking for a private island.
Only my share.
You go out... with friends?
Is your time so empty?
A man should have a hobby.
I imagine so.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
You'd know, of course.
You're very... kind.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
I've caused you some trouble.
I'd like to.
No.
Thank you. Again.
I have?
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
The bathroom.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Los Angeles.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
You have a vacancy?
Why?
Now what?
I'm sorry.
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Please... I'd like to go...
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Then I'm free to go...?
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
