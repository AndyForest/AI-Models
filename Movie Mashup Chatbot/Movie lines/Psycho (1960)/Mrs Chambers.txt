He's already been.
Maybe you saw Mary!
Norman took a wife?
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Mary is Lila's sister?
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
Oh?
Have you two had breakfast?
Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
Barefaced.
Arbogast.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
