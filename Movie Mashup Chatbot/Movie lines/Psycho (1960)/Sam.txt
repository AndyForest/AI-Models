I don't believe it.  Do you?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
What are you talking about?  What is this?
Why?
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
What's your interest?
Who are you, friend?
It's regular. Okay?
Bates.
You can't go up there.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Bates never denied Mary was here.
What is it?
What?
Sorry.
What makes you sound so certain?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
I'm glad we didn't.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
She always tries to be proper.
Watch your tenses.
This is the old highway.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
She was willing to lick the stamps.
Where'd you go to college?
Of course we will.
Neither will I.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Our Deputy sleeps.
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Yes. I think he would have.
In a hurry.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
He didn't come back here?
Contemplate your... panic button.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Stay here.
You'll never find it.
Probably on his way back right now.
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think.
Arbogast said...
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
I feel better when you feel better.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
It's been three.
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
She'll need both of us.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Maybe we can handle it together.
You've led a charmed life.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
No.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Is Mary... in trouble?
What thing could we be in together?
What thing?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
I was getting to that!
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
What should I know?
What's the matter?
Where?
Here?
Is something wrong?
Lila.
Sure...
Yes?
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
How can you even think a thing like that!
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
All right.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
I can come down next week.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
You can't laugh at it, huh?
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
For what?
The only girlish thing you have lost.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
We could laze around here a while longer.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
We have a problem.
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
...Forty thousand dollars!
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
I didn't think so.
And now that your mother's dead?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Fine.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Haven't any.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
Just coming up to ring for you.
No mother.
You didn't find anything.
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Was that all?
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
Yes.
They thought she'd be coming to me.
