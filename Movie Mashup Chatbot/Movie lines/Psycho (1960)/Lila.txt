I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
Sam, if she's here...
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
I don't know.
I don't know.
I still feel...
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes.
What difference does that...
Please!
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Forty thousand dollars.
She stole some money.
Yes.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
I could stand something regular.
Why not?
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
Hospital clean.
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
I believe it.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
You going to wait here for me?
Huh?
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
Alive.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
You're not.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Yes.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
Does that mean we can't...
Well?
Who's he?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Without calling me?
Where could he have gone?
Sam.
Just wait here?
Why can't I go out there with you?
Sam, I'm going.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
An hour! Or less!
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Yes.
Where's the old highway?
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Where... can I stay?
You want me to stay here?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
She haven't even called you?
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I ought to call the police right now!
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Yes.
I hate tears.
Huh?
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
What do you know about it?
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
A good reason, I suppose.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Don't you know?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
With you.
I want to know if my sister is here.
Is Mary here?
I'm Mary's sister.
May I talk to you?
