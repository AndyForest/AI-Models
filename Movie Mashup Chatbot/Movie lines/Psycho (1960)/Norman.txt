No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
No. I told you, she's confined...
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Now, look...!
Of course not.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
My mother.
I live there. Alone.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
Not at all!
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Cash.
What?
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
What do you mean?
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
No! Of all...
No.
No.
No.
The following morning. Sunday.
Very early. Dawn.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
What?
I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
No. At least I don't recall.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Oh.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
You out to buy a motel?
No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
That's it.
Alright, Miss...
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Phoenix?
You're not going to... to your room already?
Thank you, Norman.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
To a private island, like you?
A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
Oh I do... but I say I don't.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
What are you running away from?
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything.
Uncommon, too.
Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...
You eat like a bird.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You have something most girls never have.
Norman Bates.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there....
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
Dirty night.
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Shut up!
Do what?
I don't know what you've been saying.
My mother is not dead!
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Yes.
Satisfied with your cabin?
Looking for me?
I'll show you the cabin.
I'll get your bags.
It isn't necessary.
I'll take you to...
I suppose you want a cabin.
