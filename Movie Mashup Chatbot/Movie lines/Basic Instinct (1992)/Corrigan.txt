Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
Did you ever tie him up?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
