Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
A couple days ago.
Yeah, I was drinking.
Yeah.
Home. Watching TV.
No.
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Bring 1976 up.
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
Thanks.
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
Did you find out about her parents?
She was there, wasn't she?
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Put your hands up!
You should do something about this lock.
Why did you change your name?
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
What did she tell me, Beth?
Tell me about Catherine.
I thought you hardly know her.
What is this interest you've got in her?
I don't need any help.
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
What was she like in school?
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
No.  I mean it, thank you.
You did it for me.
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
Who?
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
I need a cigarette.
Why didn't you tell me?
She said what you said she'd say.
Who?
What else is new?
What are you doing here?
Yeah.
Thank you.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
No.
It's been three months.
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
How did it end?
Why?
Why not?
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
I'm writing a book.
No thanks.
I have to do some research tomorrow.
No.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
How'd you get in here?
No.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
I found Lisa Henderson.
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
Can I talk to you a minute?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
I don't know.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
You paid $50,000 for your character?
Why?
When?
Try me.
No?
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
It's OK.  It's OK.
No.
Did you like her to watch?
I know.
I don't have a choice.
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
It hurts.
How's your shoulder?
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
What did you think?
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
I'll meet you there.
How's your new book?
To see if I can get away with it.
I'll risk it.
No.
Yes.
When did you write it?
Why does he do it?
What's it about?
What do you want from me, Catherine?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
My wife used to call me that.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What did you pay Nilsen?
Ice?
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
You can make a mistake.
Don't get too cocky.
Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink?
I like you.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
How exactly did you hear?
I didn't.
No.
Didn't you study it in school?
She wiped out her whole family.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
You tell me.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
No, thanks.
Am I... disturbing you?
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
I passed.
Why not?
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
Sure.
Even though you were fucking him.
Because you didn't love him --
But you didn't hurt --
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
How did you feel when he died?
You like playing games, don't you?
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
What's your new book about?
I told you -- I quit.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I quit.
I don't smoke.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
If that's the way you want to play it.
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Was there anyone with you last night?
Did you go home with him?
Did you leave the club with him?
Were you with him last night?
How long were you having sex with him?
How long were you dating him?
I'm De...
You did.
Thanks.
He had a girlfriend?
What kind of talk?
Was she ever a suspect?
Nilsen?
Do you remember his name?
Routine.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Were there ever any suspects?
What was the weapon?
I'm going with you.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
Catherine told me what was in it.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
You're my friend, Gus.
I don't believe it.
Catherine says you don't like her.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
I don't know.  I'm just not.
I'm not afraid of her.
You feeling better?
You don't like punk rockers?
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
I wasn't there last night, either.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
I know what that's like.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
I don't think it's funny.
You think I --
I don't know.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I got tired of being played with.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
Was she ever suspect?
What are you doing here, Pop?
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
She misses me.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
It was an accident.
You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
She killed him.
No.
What about me?
Fuck you, Phil.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Now what?
I'm sure.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
So what do we do -- nothing?
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
Are you kidding me?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
What was it?
He was shot.
Can there be some mistake?
Can you check again?
Did you check all four years?
How old was she when this happened?
Who are you?
Why do you think he's dead?
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
