I hate rugrats.
What do we do now, Nick?
The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
I told you.  She kills him.
I finished my book.
Somebody always does.
Somebody has to die.
It won't sell.
What happens to them?
Really.  What are you writing about.
What are you researching?
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
Come over here and tell me no.
Did you miss me?
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Liar.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
Did you?  What's she doing?
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
Of course I knew.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
Funny.
What did he say?
I'll convince you.
Do you believe me?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
About three months before I met you.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
You won't believe me.
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
No.
I never have before.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
Make love to me.
Everybody that I care about dies.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
You're in over your head.
You shouldn't play this game.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
Fine.  How's your back?
Do you want her to join us sometime?
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Did you think it was so special?
She's seen everything before.
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
Why take the risk?
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
To see if he can get away with it.
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
It's not the same thing, is it?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
What if I call you Nicky?
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
Please.
Fine.
Not me.
Why not?
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Do you?
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
There's a name from the past.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
I don't know.  But you do.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
No.  Come in.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
You know all about me.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
I'm tired.
Thanks.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
That's right.
No.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
I loved him.  I hurt.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I have nothing to hide.
Did I miss something?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
It won't last.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
Yes, you do.
Do you have a cigarette?
Only when they make interesting reading.
Are you arresting me?
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
Yes.
Yes.
About a year and a half.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
I know who you are.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
No.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
No thank you.
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
Cocaine.
Sometimes.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
It teaches you to lie.
Yes I am.
Why would I need an attorney?
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How?
How did he die?
