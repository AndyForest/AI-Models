What?
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
What are you doing here?
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
I had him in two classes.
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
She told you, didn't she?
What do you want, Nick?
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
Sometimes I really hate you.
Nilsen.
No, Nick, please --
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
I thought you quit.
We were in some of the same classes.
Catherine Tramell.
What was she like?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
You don't look so okay.
You okay?
Yes.
How's not smoking?
No?
How about the coke?
How about the booze?
How is your -- personal life?
So -- how are things?
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
How are you, Nick?
