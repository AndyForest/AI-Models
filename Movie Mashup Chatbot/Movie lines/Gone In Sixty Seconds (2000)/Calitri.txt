Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...

You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
Yes ... Kip ...
