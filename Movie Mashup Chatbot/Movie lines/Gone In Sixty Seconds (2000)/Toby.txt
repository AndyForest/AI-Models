You've been pre-booked...
Yes, sir -
I know, sir ...
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
What am I supposed to do?
I dunno ...
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Sure -
You goin' home?
I'm cool -
Hey, Kip, what's up?
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
You sure I can't go with ya?
Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
How come ... ?
What about me?
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
So she flies -
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
Who's "Eleanor?"
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Yeah, I'm cool ...
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
Which way's out, man -- ?
Checkin' it out
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
