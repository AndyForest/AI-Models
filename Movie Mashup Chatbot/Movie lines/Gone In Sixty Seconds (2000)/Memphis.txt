Point-five ...
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
I think about that night a lot...
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Fish.
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Jesus ...
Who was the job for?
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
It seems she neglected to mention it
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
What kind of job... ?
Tell me about Kip -
Six years ...
What about?
What are you doing here?
How's the leg?
You got no choice. It's over.
What do you mean -- ?
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
Get out --
Get out of here, Ray --
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
And if he doesn't make it -- ?
Sound it out for me.
I'm just here about my brother.
I'm not interested --
They gave you only four days?
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
I don't want him hurt...
It's about my brother ... Kip...
How ya doing?
Double-meaning intended --
Consider me gone, Detective --
You know my back.
What do you want from me?
Not my girl anymore
I'm on the move -
I don't think so, Detective ...
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
You know my back.
And this has what to do with me?
Kip.
No...
A little family emergency --
You know my back.
You have my word...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
Let them go --
How's Atley -- ?
You know my back -
Not at all ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
The other day....
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
How's it going -- ?
And there she is --
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
Forget that ...
You know where the others are?
How you doing, man?
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
You remember that, Kip?
Mother -- !
Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
What time of year?
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
You getting my checks ... ?
He's in some trouble ...
Why didn't you tell me?
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
No.
How's Kip?
You, too, Ma...
Thought I'd go for a ride -
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
You okay -- ?
Move over ...
You boost her -- ?
Where'd you find this one?
What are you doing here?
I know ...
I know. I've missed you, too
Come here -
Come here -
Come here --
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Too early to tell. Nervous?
You okay -- ?
Having fun, Kip?
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
What era was that -- ?
Dad'd be proud --
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
Thank-you ...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
"Shadow games?"
You hear me?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
What are you doing here?
You don't think so, huh?
You?
You?
You can handle it?
You can handle it?
He's gonna kill you -- !
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
What happened to you?
I can see that -
"About what?"
So what are you gonna do?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
What do you got ... ?
Okay --
Yeah --
Something like that -
Yeah -
You sure you're okay -- ?
Sure --
You okay -- ?
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Just hold-on there --
You all right -- ?
Kip -- ?
You, too
Hey, Kip ...
DO IT! NOW -- !
Call 911 -
How's it going?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
We're going shopping -- !
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Take it back, Freb --
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
He give you an advance -- ?
Bench seats.
She does have one thing you don't.
What -- ?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
I dunno. I know a place.
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Yeah ... You -- ?
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
And Tracy's on the move ...
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
Let me worry about The Club ...
Hear you roar ...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
Now... I'm in ...
I do ... I cut "em...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
The alarms go off ...
Unlock your button ...
Slip it in ...
I take out my slim-jim...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
No. Open her ...
Ready -- ?
Oh. Okay. Right.
No ...
No way ...
Very good...
I always thought you'd follow me up.
Okay.
That what you want?
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
What's wrong with her -- ?
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
I understand -
Six or seven...
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
Kip's in trouble
And here I am...
I left town. I didn't leave you.
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
On account of Mitch?
So I was replaced by Mitch?
"Mitch?"
Buy you a drink?
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
I'll see you soon --
What happened to Sway?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
Okay, then... Otto?
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
No we don't -
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
And the moral of that story is -- ?
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
Is he still working here ?
The hard part ...
Tell me...
You think it can be done?
He's gotten involved --
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
Of course. Hi, Junie --
Hello, Otto ...
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
So what's in there -- ?
She soars -
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
How old are you now, Toby?
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Excuse me --
Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
You know what you got here?
