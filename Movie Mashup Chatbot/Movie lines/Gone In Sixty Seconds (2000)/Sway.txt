What's that?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
This time it's for real?
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
What are you doing... ?
You okay -- ?
Where to -- ?
How is he -- ?
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
No worries ...
What about The Club ... ?
Wrong preposition...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Cut 'em...
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
"Unlock my button" ... ?
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Oh, God...
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
So, you seeing anybody?
Deodorant.
What the hell's that -- ?
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
Oh, yeah.
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
No ... ?
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
You mentioned that in your letters
That's what I want ...
I go with you --
She's trouble --
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
Hey.
Hey -
What the hell are you doing -- ?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
And you got some Italians -- ?
What kind of trouble -- ?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
A distinction worth noting ...
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
On account of me.
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
Mitch.
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
You look like you lost your sheep ...
What's with the look?
What are you doing here?
