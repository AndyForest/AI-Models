You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
How is he?
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
You betcha --
I'll catch you later, Randall --
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
I know you.
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Your girl works in there ...
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Something like that -
What are you still doing here, Randall?
I know you.
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
I know you.
Get out of here, then. Now.
I don't golf...
You'll leave -- ?
How's that?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You want to come along quiet?
I know you --
Right ...
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
What's wrong with it -- ?
What's this -- ?
Castlebeck.
