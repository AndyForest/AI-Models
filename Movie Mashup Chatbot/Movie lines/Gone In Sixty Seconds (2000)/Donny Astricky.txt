Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Donny-nothin'!
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
We're partners here --
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
Yeah?
What's the matter?
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Good.
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
Well, that defies the point, don't it?
How'd it go?
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
What color?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
What about him?
You guys have any skills at all?
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
It's arright ...
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
Most of 'em are late-model...
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
I think so too --
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
There's no one left ...
Yeah...
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
