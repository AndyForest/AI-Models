No. That was Higgins ....
Gray.
Peugot convertible ...
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
Hey, Donny --
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
Remember who my brother is?
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
We'll take it.
We'll take it...
Whatcha got left ... ?
Any more, O -- ?
Just hold on... Hold on ...
No...
Any more ...
Don't go there, Toby --
Damn crooks is everywhere --
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Yeah... You want a ride...
What do you say, Toby?,
Where you off to -- ?
You want me to buy her?
Sure, man --
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Toby...
Toby...
I've missed you, man ...
What?
What?
I don't know. What -- ?
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
Nah.
I'm cool.
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
Price of doing business...
The era when crime didn't pay --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
The family that steals together, deals together...
De nada ...
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
Shadow games ...
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
Otto called -
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
Me...
Me.
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
Hey, now -
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
What?
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
About what?
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
Hey, you want something to eat ?
Nah. It's a scratch.
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
I heard you were pumping gas -
Cool. So you're living up North?
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Yeah ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
Hello, Memphis --
Hospital.
Shit ...
Now, we go -
I gotta get my tool --
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
No problem -
