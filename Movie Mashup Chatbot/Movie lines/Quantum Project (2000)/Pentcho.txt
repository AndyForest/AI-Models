Mia...?
Excuse me???
You did miss --
You did.
Dad...
You taking any medication?
Why?
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
How?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
A quantum one.
Could be.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
It's an experiment.
That's the physicist's playground.
Where to?
I could go out of town.
Okay.
Could we go somewhere?
I've been dreaming about you.
