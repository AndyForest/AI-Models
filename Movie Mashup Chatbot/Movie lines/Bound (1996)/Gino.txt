Give it to me.
Gimme the gun.
We're family, Caesar.
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
Caesar!
Caesar?  What is this?
We know how this was done, eh?
Johnnie, what did I say?
Hey, Johnnie ...
Done.  We go now.
Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
