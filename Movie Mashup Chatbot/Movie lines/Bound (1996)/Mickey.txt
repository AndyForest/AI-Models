Leave your phone on the hook.
You got the key?
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Where in the hell is he?
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
Is that the money?
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
Cease, can I ask you something?
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
We was worried about you, Cease.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
Caesar, you still got the money?
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
What?  They ain't there?
Yeah?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Are you okay, Violet?
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Violet?
I think everything is okay.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
