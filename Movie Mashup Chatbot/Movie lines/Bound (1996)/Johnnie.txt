You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
Where's what?
I think you're fucking crazy!
What are you talking about?
How the fuck can I open it?
All right!  Where's the key?
Know what?
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
Just admit it, Caesar.
The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
You shouldn't have hit me.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Pop?
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
