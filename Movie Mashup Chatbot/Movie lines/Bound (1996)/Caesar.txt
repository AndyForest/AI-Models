Where is it?
The next one blows off your dick.
The money!
Where is it?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
The same way you did before.
You don't need a key.
Open the case!
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Admit what?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
What's that, Johnnie?
Two point one seventy-six.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
You want to get into this now?
Here, put this in his mouth.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
I can't.  I can't.
No!
Stay away!
Sit down, Gino!
No, Gino!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Yeah, I know.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
You know he would have done you, too.
Now that's teamwork.
Sure, Gino, sure.
Yes, I understand.
I'm listening.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
They were in a car accident.
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
What?
Shut up!
I had to.  You made me.
You betrayed me!
I saved you.
What did she do to you?
Shut up, Violet.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Stupid cunt!
Violet!
Shut up, Violet!
Where is the money?
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
We're going to need some time.
Where, then?
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
Fuck.
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
...  maybe three hours.
Tell them!  Tell them!
Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie.
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Violet, I won't let you leave.
I need you ...
You can't leave.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
He didn't see you, did he?
He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
Violet, please!
Got to think this through ...
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
It's impossible!
It couldn't have been.
What?
Why?
No!  They're still on their way.
What are you, drunk?
What are you talking about?
There's no time.
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
Why?  'Cause you know him?
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
Not bad.  What for?
What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
So, you just got out?
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
Oh, shit ...
What the fuck is going on?
All part of the business.
Good idea.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Oh, right.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Why?
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Where is it?
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Another time.
What?  How about a drink?
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
How many'd you do?
You're helping Rajeev?
Where's the fucking money?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Yeah, that's it.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
Yeah.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Me?  Why?
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
Okay, sure, Mick.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Hey, Mickey.
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
