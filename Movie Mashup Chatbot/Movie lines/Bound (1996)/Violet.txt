Caesar, you don't know shit.
Caesar, don't.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
I should have let him kill you.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ...
But everybody is all right.
We were in a car accident --
Good boy.
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
You murdered Gino!
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Everything you couldn't.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
You need the money just like we do.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Not until he has the money!
He can't kill you --
Don't tell him --
Just hurry.
Who are you going to call?
What are you doing?
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
It's not here, Caesar.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
What happened to them?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
What?
Caesar, what are you going to do?
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Caesar ...
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Caesar, this is crazy.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
The hell I can't!
This is insane!
No.
But it could be anywhere.
The money?  The money's gone.
All right, Caesar.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Caesar, what are we going to do?
But you know he did it.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
It was him.  I'm positive.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
That doesn't make any sense.
You mean they weren't up here?
They just left, didn't they?
They were early.
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
What are you going to do with it?
Caesar, what happened?
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Jesus, Caesar!
She's doing the work herself.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
I didn't expect --
All part of the business.
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
...  thank you.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
All right.
How do I know you are cops?
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
Hello?
No.
I'm here, aren't I?
Hey.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
I was so afraid you ...
Oh, thank God.
okay, all right.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
What if he doesn't run?
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
It's me.
I won't.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Jesus, that's beautiful.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
Why?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
I'm just asking, what if?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
What if he sees you?
Shit!  Oh shit!
Where will you be?
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
He does it right in front of him.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Yeah, twice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's his brother.
Gino Marzzone.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Johnnie?
Yes.
It's in a case, on his desk.
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
To let it dry.
He hung it up.
Yeah.
Do you think you know me like that?
Is that what you think?
You think I'm lying?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do.  I suppose that's why he's good at it.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.
Yes.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
You mean Shelly?
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
Work.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
What you heard wasn't sex.
I don't.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Because it's the truth.
We're not that different, Corky.
I don't understand - ?
What are you afraid of?
You didn't want to see me, did you?
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
What's wrong?
I'm glad you did.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
I'm already in your bed.
The redistribution of wealth?
What?
Yes, it is.
Almost five years.
Basically.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
You have to ask?
...  I needed that.
I wanted to apologize.
I had to see you.
...  yes.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
A beer.  Of course.
What do you want?
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Sure.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Yeah, come on in.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
My pleasure.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Oh, really.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
I knew it.
Truck.  Of course.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
You're doing everything yourself?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
I guessed you were straight black.
So this is temporary for you?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?  Get away from all of this.
I know you will.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
Oh, God.
Caesar wants me to stay.
