I could be lying.
You can't kill me yet.
No.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
Lick me.
Sure.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
I should be going.
Five.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
...  Me neither.
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
How'd it go?
Hey.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
I'm still here.
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
What happened?
I think we're going to find out.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
Thank you.
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
He'll have to run.
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
Not Caesar.
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
There is no going back.
If he does ...
Trust me, Violet.
He won't.
An accident.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Fine.
Any bodyguards?
What time did you say they would be there?
What did Gino drink?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
What happened?
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Sweet Jesus.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
...  shit.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Who is Gino?
Why?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Good.
Does the case lock?
And where is it now?
What?
Then what?  Exactly.
You said he washed the money?
I think ...
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
I am, but ...
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
How much money?
What choice?
For what?
Mickey?
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
He was in love with you, right?
Even though he knew about you?
I think so, too.
I suppose he just wants to watch.
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
What about that guy this morning?
What was it then?
What the fuck was it?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
Is that what her daddy tells her?
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
I'm not afraid of anything.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
Shit, here we go.
Nothing.
So am I.
I guess I wanted to.
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
The redistribution of wealth.
Five years is a long time.
How long have you been with him?
He's a launderer?
How did you meet him?
No.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
Tell me about it.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
No.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
Why?
Maybe.
Curious, maybe.
No.
A beer?
Okay, one drink.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
He said you lost something.
Not exactly.
Thanks.
Caesar is your husband?
Do you know him?
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
'63 Chevy.
Truck.
Yeah.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Are they really?
Oh, I'm sorry --
A favor?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Good guess.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
Who?
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
