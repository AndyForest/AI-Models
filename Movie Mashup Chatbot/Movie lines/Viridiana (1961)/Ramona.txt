It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Yes, sir.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
What's the matter?
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Yes, sir. Good night.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
I don't know, sir.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
How do you feel?
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
