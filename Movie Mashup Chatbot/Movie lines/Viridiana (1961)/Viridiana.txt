You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
Let me pass!
Go away! Leave me alone.
You're lying.
Don't go!
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Maybe ...
Unfortunately ...
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Wasn't that cowardice?
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
Whatever you like.
Thank you, Uncle.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
And this innocent child.
Evil.
How could anybody behave like that?
Don't you ever see him?
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Only because you want it.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
Come down.
Who is she?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
No.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
Ramona! Ramona!
But why? Why?
My God, what have you done to him!
That doesn't matter; I like it.
It's very good.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Me?
Why?
Is she coming back?
And ...your friend?
Yes. Why?
I'll be ready.
Are they going to work here too?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Leave him alone.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
Well... is it so urgent?
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Are you Jorge?
Stop this!
Don't say that.
Are your parents alive?
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
How are you today?
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Where?
Why not?
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
What's going on, Moncho?
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
Forgive me if I have offended you.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
I had so many things to think about!
Mother.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
All right, Mother.
Mother?
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
Don't talk like that!
Good, then let's go!
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
What about you, Manuel?
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Have I slept long?
What happened to me?
I have a headache.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
How did you see me?
What?
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Hello.
