Canelo!
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
It's for people!
