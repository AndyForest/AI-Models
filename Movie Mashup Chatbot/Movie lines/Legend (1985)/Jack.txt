No, wait... please... listen...
Oh no... Don't you understand?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
It's terrible.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
East of Mercia?
Cathay?
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
I didn't know... I --
I'll try.
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
I was with the Princess.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
A good day for singing...
He'll not escape me.
Sapphire!
I could have struck off his head just now!
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Hurry up!
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Can't we move any faster?
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Will you explain what's going on?
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
What weapon?
Did you bring me here to sup?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
I don't... understand.
Can you save her?
The wound is mortal.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
It doesn't matter.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
One more turn...
There must be some way to get it up there.
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
What magic have we on our side?
There isn't much time!
Water doesn't burn...
Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
The chill is worse this night.
Can we trust him?
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
We'll find it.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Wait!
It bodes evil.
There's the way, mates.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Certainly understandable.
Ogg's footprints!
My God!  Look!
Nice piece of work.
Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Good.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Stealing his arms?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
What know you of fields of war?
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
This is ogre's magic.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Beware.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
We must follow that bird.
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
The colt's still too small.
Damn them!
It would appear so.
What is it?
Shhhh!
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
By the grace of God.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Knaves and robbers...
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
And who might that be?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
The princess is dead.
And if she thinks me a liar?
What do I do?
Are we here?
Will you lead me to her?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
There must be an answer somewhere.
Don't you care about what's happened?
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
Don't you know?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
But... but, why?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
What does she want from me?
I fear she's lost.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
It's bluebells!
And if I cannot?
I meant no disrespect.
No... I... I need to rest.
Enough!
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
Faerie ring?
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Gump, is it?
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Everywhere!  Ow!
Pinching me!
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Lili... I love you!
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
You're teasing still.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Sunlight?
What?
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
No!  I won't let it happen...
They told me you were dead.
I thought you were dead... I --
What have I done?
Lili!  No!
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
I have no wife.
Tis not fit for a princess.
I'm afraid it may storm.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
My lady mocks me.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Tis the truth.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
Its powers are strong.
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
He did run?
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
They tricked you.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
Who?
What happened?
To fetch your napkin.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Are you honest?
They rival the angels of paradise.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
Shhh!
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
I'm not its master.
I'll go search for it.
What's the matter?
Be patient.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
Stop complaining.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Unicorn?
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Sport, indeed.
Or perchance...
I may have said perhaps...
Never.
These for me?
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
Sigurd's sword...
His feet shall never cross my lips.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Honored to make your acquaintance.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
This is sad news, be it true.
I don't believe you.
No!
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Exceeding fair.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
What became of the princess?
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Not very precise directions.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
How do I get the horn back?
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Heading north still?
Be fair, Oona.
And as barren of love as stone.
Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
Please...
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
I'm promised to another!
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
How so?
That was in jest.
Wondrously so.
In every way.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
And charmed, of course.
I'd be honored.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
No fear of that now.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
This is not the time for squabbling.
I pray God grants it me.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Where?
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Praise be to God.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
I think she's about to foal.
We wait.
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
You're with us in battle.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Oh, but I have.
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
You've been inside?
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Can you show us the way?
You do know where it is?
Simple as that, eh?
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Is he a friend, then?
I'm sending you back to Hell!
