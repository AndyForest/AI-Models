True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
You... you... you mortal you!
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
And sweet?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Jest with me then.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
And am I not fair?
Do I not please you, Jack?
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Only that?
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Sorry.
Courage, Jack.
