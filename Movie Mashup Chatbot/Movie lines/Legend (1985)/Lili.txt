To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Might we watch, too?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
What was that?  Did you hear that?
You're a beast!
I don't expect you'd understand.
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
I see...
What will become of me then?
And then?
Oh, yes...
What do you want from me?
Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
No more... please...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Do it now!
Damn you!
I'd soon die.
Why have you brought me here?
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Like some vile toadstool.
Protection?
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
And you... are you not also afraid?
You... you're a beast!
God protect me.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Grotesque... monstrous...
But I'm hideous!
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
What do you want with me?
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
I can't see a thing.
Pinching?  Where?
Biting you?
What's the matter?
And I love you, my husband.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
And I... love you...
In the dark... where I join him...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
You've freed me, Jack...
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
Only what's right...
Jack... Forgive me...
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Then, perchance you'll me.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Oh, la...
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
I don't want it on me.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
My own father...
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My father and the Baron.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Where are you going?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Jack!
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
How much longer?
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Oh, dear.
What shall we do?
I detest serpents.
A gentleman would offer water.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
A promise is a sacred oath.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Liar!
But you did... you did!
You promised!
If you like.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
