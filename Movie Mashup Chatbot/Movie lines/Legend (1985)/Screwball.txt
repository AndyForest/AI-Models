Sorry.
How're these?
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Aye... my Lord...
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Three cheers for our champion.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
You see!  You see!
No, no, no... this is different!
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Sorry, Jack.
Hello, Jack.
Or a kite...!  We could make a kite... Let the wind do the work --
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
What care the bones when the soul is free?
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Up ahead!
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
What's she doing?
What do we do now?
The fastest in the world.
