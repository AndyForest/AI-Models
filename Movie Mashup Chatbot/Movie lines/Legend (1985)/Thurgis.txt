May God protect you.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
Uhm... fine work.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?

Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
