What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
You'll visit again?
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Dead, dead, dead.
She's dead!
As fair as me?
Is she fair, this princess?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Ask away, sweet man.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
What's this now?
