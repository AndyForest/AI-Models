I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
There are only three or four left.
Here come six more... grid two!
It could be worse...
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
No!...
They'll find its weakness.
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
And you?
He'll be well cared for.
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
