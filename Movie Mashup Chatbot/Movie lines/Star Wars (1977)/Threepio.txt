Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
I read you sir.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
