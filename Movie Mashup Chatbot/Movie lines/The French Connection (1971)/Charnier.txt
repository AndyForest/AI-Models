Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Did they follow you?
Did you pick up the car?
Henri c'est gentil d'�tre venu.  Je vous pr�sente mon associ�, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
It's your problem.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Twelve o'clock... yes...
... Salvatore?...
Allo... Salvatore...
That's a relief.
Are you sure it is dead?
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Non!
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de s�renit�. Elle m'a demand� de tes nouvelles et si nous �tions heureux.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass� voir Fran�oise.
Pour moi?
Avec �a tu pourras le supporter.
Encore du sho ping!
Si tu veux.
Tu sais j'ai r�fl�chi longuement � ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-m�me.  Tiens.
There'll be someone else.
Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
We must follow it.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler � la t�l�vision.
Une erreur!  C'est g�nial.  C'est une vedette � la t�l�vision.  Il peut aller partout sans �tre soup�onn�... En plus il a besoin de fric.
Il est en retard.
Sale boulot.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Who financed it?
It's beautiful.
