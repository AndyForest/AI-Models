Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.

This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.

We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.

Policy man in Queens.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
Drink this.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
