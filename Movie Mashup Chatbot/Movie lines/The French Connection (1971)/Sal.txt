Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Yes --
Who's this --
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
