Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
When ya go back on?
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Yeah!
Why not?
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
