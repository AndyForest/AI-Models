Then what do I do?
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
THE WHITEFOLK?
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Thank you.
Yes sir
I don't. I have my own.
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Yes?
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
Don't pay to complain.
They good whitefolks?
In case of what?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Ya think?
I miss her.
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am..
Yes ma'am.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Oh.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
May I come in?
No..No that won't do...
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
No. I mean work work.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Mama?
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Mama let me help you.
But mama..
MAMA!
Morning, ma'am.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Won't you be late for work?
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Should I wake her?
That was fun.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
