I will.
Well, good luck with the job.

You think she sure 'nough your sister?
She gone like they say?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
Your mother all right?
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
You on your way home?
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
Leave off..
You don't know what I think.
Jesus.
What yard? When who-
I don't want to know.
There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
You remember your price, Stamp?
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
Just me.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
For what?
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
What, baby?
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
You got to get up from here, girl.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
Yeah. Look bad?
Sethe?
