We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
Aw, Baby.
You still know.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You saying nothing counts?
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
Say the Word!
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
Well?
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
Here, let me carry that.
Folks came.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
That's so.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
I run him off.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
Ella.
You was friends.
Aw, no, Ella.
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
It's her, ain't it?
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
The church!
Can't locate him.
True.
I know what I see.
I know Denver.
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
Oh I been out.
All he can. All he can.
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Who is she? Where she come from?
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
She was only-
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
It ain't what you think.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
I don't believe that. I won't.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
No use thinking these things now.
Never found out.
You planning to do anything about it?
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Yes sir.
