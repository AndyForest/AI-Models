What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YOU HURT ME.
and she is mine...
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
I want somethin' sweet.
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
You don't sit with me!!
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
YES.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
