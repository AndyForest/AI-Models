..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
You remember Halle.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
No. Sorry.
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
Baby, don't be like that.
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
WILL YOU STAY?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
No...no...no..
She likes this dress...
Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Go upstairs I said!!
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Morning.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
No, let her rest.
Could be that fall you took.
Back stiff?
She was my best thing.
She left me. She's gone again.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
No, You looking good.
You shaved.
Paul D.
Make it the way I always do.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
