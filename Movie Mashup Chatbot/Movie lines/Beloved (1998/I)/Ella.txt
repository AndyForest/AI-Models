You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
He knew Baby Suggs?
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
You?
What run him off? Tell me that!
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
Till she showed herself.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Her who?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
I don't know him that well.
He ask, I give him anything.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
He's sleeping in the church.
Better ask Paul D.
Might see anything at all at 124.
You sure?
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Out where?
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
