Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Omar, listen to me--
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
Omar--
Your Raoul?
You hate Raoul?
We got any shots?
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Since when?
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
