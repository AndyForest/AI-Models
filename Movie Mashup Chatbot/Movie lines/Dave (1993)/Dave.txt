I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
Fine.
Fine...
Yeah.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
I'm... not... nobody...
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
Great.
Well it's a last minute change.
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
That shelter was in this bill.
No...
What the hell is this ?
I mean,  if it's a problem...
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
... Alright.
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
Great.
I promise.  I won't.
A month.
And we're going away for a holiday.
What's with her?
Don't worry.
Oh... Okay.
Holy cow.
You're kidding?
First Lady...
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
The usual...
Is this dangerous or anything?
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
Right.
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Well -- take care.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
So what do we do?
You could buy it on payments.
Choices?
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I am the government.
And who's gonna find out?
I don't think so
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
It's fine.
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
So you want to go swimming?
Now he's making stuff up about me.
She knows.
We've got to fix this.
Alan...
This is wrong, Alan!
What do you mean you made it all up?
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
We vetoed that?
Quick.  Gimme a quarter.
Gimme a quarter.
Fine.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
At a press conference.
Presence.
Oh.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
A teleprompter.
I see what you mean.
In the car?
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
I'm not sure... I might have.
Really?   Crazy?
No.
Will he be alright?
Oh my gosh...
What happened?
Oh my God...
Extend things?
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Why?
Perceptual?
Does it make the cars any better?
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Oh... Kinda the same way.
Really?
You know.  Your first campaign.
You ever think back to how you started.
... Sometimes they do.
Yeah.
Oh... Hi.
I just fired Bob Alexander.
They re not my attack dogs.
The Fidelity nonsense...
Something like what...
Certainly.
Ah.
What are they?
Oh... Thanks.
Thanks, Duane.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Well...
Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...
Who?
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
You're kidding.
What's that?
I was waiting for that jack.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
You ever use it?
You got a gun?
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
Oh.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
Really?
Really?
What?
You're not?
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
It could be fun.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
I missed...
I never thought I'd...
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
It's nice.
Hi.
What?
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
What's wrong?
That's okay.
I know. I'm sorry...
What?
Well I guess...
It was okay?
I know.
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
I run a temp agency.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
I guess.
That's a secret.
Just wait.
I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.
Are you hungry?
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
What?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
I don't mind.
Truman used it all the time.
How were you gonna get home?
I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
Where's home?
Where are you going?
You're leaving?
They asked me to help.
I don't know.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
Anybody would have done it.
No.
Oh... Yeah.
... . Ellen.
Look.  If there was some mistake...
What's wrong with a magic trick?
I don't understand.
... How could I what?
I care about the homeless.
What?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
You bet.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
Uh...
