Die, you pond scum!
Fine?
You're fired.
Oh... I'm fired?
... what?
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
Share...
What do you think you're doing?!
Choices???
.. Nothing.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
) Listen, you little...
Alan
The Washington Post.
What the hell is this?
Mr. President...
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Dave...
I'm not certain about...
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Right and don't embellish.
For a month.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
Don't worry about it.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
It happens.  This is where you'll be sleeping.
They barely talk anymore.
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
How much do you usually get paid?
No more than the usual.
What?
Don't say a .
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
You understand what you'll be doing?
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Are you threatening me?
What do you mean by that?
I'll lock him away for good.
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
What I told him to?
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
I'm going to kill him.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
Oh.  Fine.
What's with the cameras?
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Three years.
You're kidding.
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
When does it break?
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Oh.  Excuse me.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Are you out of your mind?
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Nobody's got clean kids.
Check his kids.
What about the wife?
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
What do you mean, he's clean?
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Fine.
And...
What about her.
Is that everybody?
What about containment, Alan?
I was a senator, you know.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
We think so.
A condition...
Soon.
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
TilT we figure something out.
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
I don't give a shit.
Just don't call him, Alan!
Don't call the Vice President!
Nightmare...
Where's the girl?
I can't believe he'd do this.
