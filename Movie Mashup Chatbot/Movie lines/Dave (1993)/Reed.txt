Jesus...
Uh-oh...
Sort of... Yeah.
Just what you think I mean.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Don't do this.
Bob...
He was only doing his job.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
He's only doing what you told him to.
Bob...
You can't kill a President.
What are you gonna do?
I don't think so.
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
It's a homeless shelter.
Uh, let me get back to you...
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
Clean.
Clean.
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
Clean.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Yes.
Exactly. A condition.
Up and around?  Soon?
Mild stroke?
Like how?
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Till what?
Bob...
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
... What?
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
I know.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
He's not.
`Dave'?
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Wrong...
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
President vetoes works bill?
What?
Fine.
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Dave!
Dave...
Thanks, I wrote it.
What?
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
I don't think so.
What?
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
In the car.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
I'm afraid so.
Oh, yeah... probably...
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Extend them.  C'mere for a second.
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
All set.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
We're all set,  sir.
We're doing our best, sir.
We're working on it.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
