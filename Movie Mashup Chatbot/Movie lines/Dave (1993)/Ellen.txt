Yeah... It could be fun.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
So this is it?
... Me, too.
I know.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
Hi.
Yeah.   He's a good man.
I sure fall for some weird guys.
You really believe that?
They're crucifying you out there.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
I can't.
Yeah... Bedtime.
It was inspirational.
But you could go to jail for it.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
You find people jobs?
Yes.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You have a lot of secrets.
I really don't have much of an appetite.
What?
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
It's just so strange...
Oh... Okay.
Thanks.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
You sure this goes somewhere?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
You1re leaving, too?
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
Home.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
You weren't in the state legislature.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
That was quite a thing you did today.
Mind if I sit down?
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
You made their funding disappear!
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
You don't change, do you, Bill?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
I'm outta here.
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
What are you staring at?
