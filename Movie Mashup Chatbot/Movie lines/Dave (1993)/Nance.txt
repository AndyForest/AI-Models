How'd you get started?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
What?
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
What do you mean?
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Fertility beads.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
This is from the people of Burundi...
