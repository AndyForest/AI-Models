Where, the mall?
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
He... Sam Lombardo?
What?
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Kelly.  What is it?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Okay, what's the matter?
Whichever one I want.
Sam!  Hi!
Is that Sam Lombardo?
You can't...
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
Who is it?
That's right.
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Shit. Here we go again.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
