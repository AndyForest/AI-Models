You okay?
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
About Suzie?
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
