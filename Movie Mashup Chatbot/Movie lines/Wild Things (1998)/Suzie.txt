He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
He did say something.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
I guess.
Yes.
No.
Yeah.
About a year ago.
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
This wasn't my idea.
I said he did.
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
I wanna go home now.
Yeah... okay... he did
I wanna live at the beach someday.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
What are you looking at?
What brain?
You are.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Davy.
Shut up.
Get away from me.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
About what?
That's cop bullshit.
You got something against cigarettes?
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
Will they?
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
What?
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Are you mad at me?
Yeah, right.
But I..
Sam...
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
