I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
I want a full-scale investigation.
Where's this coming from?
Why?
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
You didn't cuff her?
She bit you?
Just tell us what happened.
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Oh, Ray... no...
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Are you crazy, Ray?
And what do they say?
What about witnesses?
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
Your Honor... Please...
I'm sorry?
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
Ms. Toller?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
What did you do then?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
