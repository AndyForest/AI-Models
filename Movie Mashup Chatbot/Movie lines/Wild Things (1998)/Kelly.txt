I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
Shit.
I think we just need to get wasted.
Nothing.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You can trust me.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Get off my property.
Police -- God -- get a life.
You're out of your mind.
Excuse me?
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
Is there some reason why you're here?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Yes.  God, Mom...
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
No you don't.
I miss Dad.
No thanks to you.
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
You notice my new jumper?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Hi, Mon.
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
I'm running away.
No little girl can ever make me come.
Say you love me.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Okay.  I love you too.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
God, I've been calling you.
Hello?
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
I'm here.
You know what it takes.
Why can't you come...
Yes.
Stick?
Do it to ourselves?
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
How much?
So you got my mom's money.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
Don't forget the car wash.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
