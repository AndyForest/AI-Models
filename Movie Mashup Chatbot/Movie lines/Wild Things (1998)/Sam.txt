How you doing, Artie?
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
This is insane.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
Talk to me Artie.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
I'd like that.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
You look pretty.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
Kelly.
Eat a power bar.
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
I don't know what to say...
Maybe she used another name.
How long?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
No.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
A ride.  You want one?
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
Thank you, Jimmy.
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
You think that's wise?
I love you.  Now give me the line.
That's not your line.
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
And you believe her?
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
Duquette.  Forget him...
Hello.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
We have to stick with the plan.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
About six and a half million dollars.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
Kelly...
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
So, where you off to now?
In back of the garage.
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
I won't.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Just like that?
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
I just want my life back...
There's nothing for them to get.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
What's that supposed to mean?
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Forget it.
Good thinking.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
Jesus, man... You okay?
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
That's right.
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
Yes.
Yes.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Story's the same, Detective...
I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
How...
We?
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
What's wrong?
That was the same thing Ray said.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
That was about as grim as it gets.
No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Put Kelly on too.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Goodbye, Sandra.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Didn't you see her this morning?
No.
Sandy... What's up?
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
Hi, Sandy.
