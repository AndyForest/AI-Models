Yes I do!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
No! That's not true!
God help you, Lynette!
Lynette, where's Sid?
No. I never feel like that.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No way... Would you?
What do you mean?
I haven't made up my mind.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
He ask you out for next weekend?
How did it go with you guys?
Everything was different.
Yeah... Mmmm...
Great.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
That was you guys, huh?
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
One more minute.
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Because he's my friend, too.
I'd like to come with you.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why'd he do it?
So?
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Twenty-two years ago.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
That's okay. I'm used to it.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Are those for me?
When I'm good and ready.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
I've seen all that a hundred times.
What's the matter?
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Does it still hurt?
God.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I don't want you to move.
Want me to get a towel?
It sure was.
Any time, sailor.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
I know who you are and what you want.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
He didn't give you much choice.
I vote for the motel.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Not me.
You got a girl?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
Really?
Seriously.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
