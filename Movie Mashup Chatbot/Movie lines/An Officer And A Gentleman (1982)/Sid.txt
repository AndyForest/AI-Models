Zack, don't!
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
No, sir.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
No, sir.
No, sir!
No, sir.
No.
I didn't call you anything before that.
I called you Sarge.
Pardon?
How're you doing, Sarge?
Well, I'll be goddamned.
What?
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
How late?
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Or we could do that yeah.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
You're sure it's okay?
Something tells me you've been here before.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Yeah.
He was. He died.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
It's mine.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
But it can't wait.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
Thanks for covering for me.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
A little.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Yeah.
Sure.
Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
Shhhh...
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
Could you believe those girls!
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
