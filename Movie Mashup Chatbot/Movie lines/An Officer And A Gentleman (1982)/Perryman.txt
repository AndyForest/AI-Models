Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
He said he grew up poor?
Yeah. All week long.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
How do you figure that's your bunk?
