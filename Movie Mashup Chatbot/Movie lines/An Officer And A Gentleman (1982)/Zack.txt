Naw. That's over with.
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Nobody. It just came to me.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
I joined the Navy.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Neither have you, pard!
Hi, Byron.
Thank you, sir!
What for?
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
Great.
I been calling for four months.
Yes, sir.
Yes, Sir.
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Good morning, girls.
Great. You can go in my place.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
Well, goodbye.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Yes, sir!
Aw screw it...
It's important, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Yes, sir!
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
No, sir!
I want to fly jets, sir!
I want to fly, sir!
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
I'm doing okay, sir.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Not exactly, sir.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
No, sir!
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
And you turned him down??
What did you tell him about the baby?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
That's brilliant.
I bet you do!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Why?
I don't know where that is.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I'm looking for Sid.
I know that.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Your real father?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
What would you do differently?
No. Is that what you want?
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
No, they're for your mom.
Hi.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
What's stopping you?
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
I'll get it if you want.
That was great.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
I've never had a girl.
You're better than candy.
That's it?
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
I'm starving.
You stayed after all.
Be a friend. Leave.
Forget it. Just get out of here.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
There's always a choice.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
My kinda group!
Me, too.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Do you go to school?
Yeah? Why're you here?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
I can't risk it.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Sid, what happened?
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
Do you know that for sure?
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
But she expects you to marry her?
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
No problem, but who's Susan?
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
That isn't true, is it?
Naw.
Hey, you guys still awake?
You okay?
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Jets.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
I've seen better.
