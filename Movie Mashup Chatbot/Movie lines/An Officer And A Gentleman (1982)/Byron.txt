I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
I never said any of that!
I wrote. Not every week...
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Great ass.
Who's that?
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Who gave you this idea?
Why?
You... in the Navy?
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
Okay, okay. You win.
Come back here, kid!
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
You, Zack?
