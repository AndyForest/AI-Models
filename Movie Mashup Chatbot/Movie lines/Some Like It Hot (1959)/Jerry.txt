A what?
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
No --- how does it go?
Fresh!
It's entirely mutual.
Thank you ever so.
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
What did he say?
Manhattans?  This time of night?
It's private.  Go away.
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
What'll I tell him?
Did you hear that?
All right - so what do we do now?
There you go with that we again.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
I may throw up.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
What do you think you're doing?
Sugar?
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Okay, Joe.
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Joe -
What are you giving me with the omelette?
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
That's some nerve!
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
Like right after the ceremony.
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Like what?
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Security.
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
You think he's too old for me?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
I am.
I'm engaged.
Have I got things to tell you!
What are you doing with my flowers?
Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
You can both go take a flying jump.
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
With ME?
And where's he going to be?
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Oh, he does!
What message?  What motorboat?
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
You know - the old shell game.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
You - you -
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
But this is so humiliating.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
And I'm not even pretty.
I got pinched in the elevator.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Good night, Josephine.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
What are you doing?
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
Men?
You tore it again!
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Polish?
Now you tore the other one.
You better come help me.
Tore off one of my chests.
Now you've done it!
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
And I'm Daphne.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
You going to call the police?
That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
Where are we running, Joe?
You don't see any blood?
I think they got me.
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
You mean it's a girls' band?
We're not too late, are we?
Right.  We have the same blood type...
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
With me?
Yeah - where were you?
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Hey, Joe!
But suppose it doesn't?
But suppose he loses?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
We're not?
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
You're right, Joe.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
Thirty-four.
I always did.
How did you get that bracelet?
What for?
Did he get fresh?
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
No!
No!
What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Josephine -
Oh yes, we do!
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
Yeah - Josephine.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
I'm a what?
His yacht?
Vanity Fair?
Okay.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
What's that?
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
You betcha.
Here you are, Sugar.
I'll carry the instruments.
Not you, Sugar.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
Who needs vermouth?
No fair guessing.
We better have a drink first.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
Half-full.
I'm fine.
I know where to get some.  Don't move.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
I'm not that sick.
I'm a very sick girl.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
Isn't that ridiculous?
That's ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
No, no.
Interesting.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Stay as long as you'd like.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
And that's one of them.
Oh, I can think of a million things -
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Oh - Sugar!
Honey - she called me honey.
Good night, Sugar.
I'll say.
We'll take a rain check.
She sings, too.
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Terribly sorry.
I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare.  Something I ate.  I'm not at all well.  See?  Hot water bottle.
I was it.
Yes.  For a whole year.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Oh - here and there - and around.
Brand new.
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
We could -
We could dye our hair.
We could pass for that.
What's wrong with us?
It's about the Florida job.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
And I can never have children.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Flower girl.
Come one!
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
Sorry.
Yes, Osgood?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
About that roadhouse -
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
I'll throw up!
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
This is where I get off.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
Why?
Wanna bet?
Most of the time I slap it.
Bull fiddle.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
I'm not surprised.
You're not sure?
You invest in shows?
You don't say.
Personally, I'm Type O.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
Me too.  Bye now.
I am Cinderella the Second.
Help yourself.
