Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.
Wanna see my driver's license?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Okay, doll.
Are these your bags?
