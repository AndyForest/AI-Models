Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
What's with him - he drinks?
Yes, I'm holding on.
- and you got to be girls.
- you got to be blonde -
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
The Florida job?
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
William Morris!
You got to be under twenty-five -
It's not the backs that worry me.
The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
