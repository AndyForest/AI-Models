Where were you guys?
What happened?
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
I don't like no witnesses.
You ain't going nowhere.
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
You and who else?
I sleep with my spats on.
I cut myself shaving.
Why?
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
Big joke!
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
I never join nothin'.
Go where?
What for?
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Why wouldn't I?
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
