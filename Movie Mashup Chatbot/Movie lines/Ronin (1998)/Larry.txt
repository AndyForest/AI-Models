Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
What is?
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
How do we know that?
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
So what's the deal?
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
Who the fuck are you?
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
Why don't you go do better, then...
Is that right?
Not for long.
Gets the job done.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
I don't think so.
Not in mine.
Is that right?
Where is this broad?
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
Eat shit and die slowly...
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
Who's they?
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
