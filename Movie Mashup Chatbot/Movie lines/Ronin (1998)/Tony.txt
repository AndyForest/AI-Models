Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Gonna be tough.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
You sure?
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
The Russian would be easier.
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
I might know where you could get a copy.
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
Why don't we step into my office...
Doing well.  This is?
My man, how you doing?
