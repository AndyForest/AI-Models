If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.

He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Bad company...
Not so fast.  Who's that?
