If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
And you respect him.
He's tough, your American friend.
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
You seem one to me.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
But first you have something to take care of?
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
