Do I need to repeat myself?
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
About time!
Lose them!
From Interpol?
What in bloody hell is going on?
Nothing.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
I thought I did.
It's been known to happen.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
What's a little hate between business partners?
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
You slept with the fucker!!
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
Why didn't you kill him?
