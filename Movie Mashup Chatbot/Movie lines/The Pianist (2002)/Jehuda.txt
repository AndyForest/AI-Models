Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Why didn't you come to me?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
There are always notices going up.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
