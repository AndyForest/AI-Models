Who told you?
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
It costs.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Tough luck.
I haven't seen him.
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
We're recruiting.
