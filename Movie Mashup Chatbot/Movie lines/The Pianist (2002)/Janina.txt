What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
