He's still a doctor.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
I'm going to get a doctor.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
Dead.
Just over a year.
He'll be here soon.
He'll be back before curfew.
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
Sit.
Come in! come in!
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
No one plays Chopin like you.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Really?
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
