Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
Not yet.
We're getting out.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Show me.
Where are you hiding?
A pianist.
What's your work?
Where do you live?
What the hell are you doing?
