That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
I'm on the run!
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Here.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
