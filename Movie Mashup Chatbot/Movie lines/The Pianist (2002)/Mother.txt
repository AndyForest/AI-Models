Boys, boys...
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Do they?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Stop it, Wladek.
God forbid!
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
Out of Warsaw.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
I've been worried sick.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
