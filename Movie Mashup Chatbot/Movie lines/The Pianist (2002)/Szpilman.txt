A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Yes.
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Who wants me to stop?
When's your baby due?
And how's Yurek?
How long have you been married?
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
I need help.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Dorota.
I'll see you...soon.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
How are you doing?
Dorota!
Wladek, please.
Wladek, please.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
It's nothing.
Who are you?
Hello.
For what? For my tie?
How will we sleep?
Let me see this.
Let's find out.
What are you doing?
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
What's happened?
What's happened?
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
I'll be fine.
wish I knew you better.
Funny time to say this.
Halina?
Calm down, what, what is it?
What's happened?
What, I'm working, what?
People I know. They said you're an important man.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
I've no money.
Can you help us?
Can you help?
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Henryk's in there.
Very appropriate.
What are you reading?
Otherwise what?
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
They were taking you away.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
You're out, aren't you?
What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
It's not funny.
I know.
That's better than yesterday.
You sell anything?
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
Just shut up.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
We use what?
That makes a change.
It certainly was.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Yes, but what good did it do?
Yes, so did the Germans.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Can you help? I've no money...
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Not this week.
Toilets?
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
But I want to help, I want to.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
So, what's the news?
You're amazing, Jehuda.
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
You made contact?
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
If you need help...
How long have you been here?
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
I'm not going anywhere.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Out of Warsaw. Where?
Where are we going?
It's a little cut, nothing.
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
Sorry, I don't remember.
No, I don't think so?
Szpilman.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
What about you?
I don't know how to thank you.
Are the Russians here?
What's happening?
What's all that gunfire?
In the attic.
I am... I was a pianist.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
