From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
It is the work of incendiaries.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
The first reports came in at about ten.
Four o'clock.
May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
