But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
What is that?
Oh?
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
