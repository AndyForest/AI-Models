This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
General Bonaparte?
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
