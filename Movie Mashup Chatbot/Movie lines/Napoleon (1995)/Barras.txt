Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.
You realize what is at stake?
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
There are none here.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
About 5,000 troops.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
Please...
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
Yes -- who spoke up?
