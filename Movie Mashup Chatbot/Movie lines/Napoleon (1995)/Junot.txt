I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Yes.
Yes.
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
I know.
God help me -- yes.
My God, what do you think?
About Hippolyte Charles.
I couldn't face telling you.
Yes, I wrote it.
I wrote it.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
That's all I can say.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
There's probably some explanation.
I believe you sent for me.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
