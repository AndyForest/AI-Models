If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
