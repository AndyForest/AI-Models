My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
No, sir.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
