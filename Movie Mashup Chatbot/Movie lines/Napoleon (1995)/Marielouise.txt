No.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Do you like music?
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
And, where did you see my portrait?
Oh, then you are...
