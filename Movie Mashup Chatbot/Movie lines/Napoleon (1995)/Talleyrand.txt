Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
And where do you place Alexander?
What I am talking about is moderation.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
