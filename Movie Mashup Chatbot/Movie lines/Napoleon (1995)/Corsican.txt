Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
Have you been back recently?
Bastia -- and you?
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Yes, sir?
