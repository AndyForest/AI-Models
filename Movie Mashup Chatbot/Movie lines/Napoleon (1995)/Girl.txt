Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Lisette La Croix.
Lisette.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
Do you have three francs, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Yes, I am, sir.
Yes, it must be.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Good evening, sir.
