I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
