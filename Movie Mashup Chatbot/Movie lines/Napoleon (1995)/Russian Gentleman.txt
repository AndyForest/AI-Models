If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
