It's time for tea, Grandma.
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
Can I make sandwiches...?
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
Daddy, why can't I...?
But you always let me....
Watch me, Grandma....
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
That's what grandmas are for.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Good night, Daddy....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
I didn't.
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
It's not nice to be evasive.
Who's coming?
You're silly....
I'm still five....
Mommy lets me....
I like Grandma's cooking....
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
Can I ride one sometime...?
You can stay in my room.
What's going on?
Yes I can....
Hurry!
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
You're the man who drives the plane.
I do....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
They had them on the big one....
