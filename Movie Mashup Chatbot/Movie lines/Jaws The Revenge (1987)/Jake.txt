He knows what he has to do....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
We're going down.  All of us....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
What difference does it make?  It's here....
You have something to say about everything....
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
Michael!
Michael!  This thing working?
Keep it steady....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
Get her started....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
You sure you know how to do this.
What do you mean, it'll find her?
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
You got a better idea...?
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
No way....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
I forgot my rubber gloves.  Let's do it.
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
All the time....
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
What the hell are you doing?
Holy Christ....
You told me what?
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
You don't like my voice...?
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
'A Moray eel....'
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
Just trying to be helpful....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
She's not going to like it....
What about Carla's gig?
I don't like it....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
We lost it....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
Half don't...Bring her about....
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Who?
Bring her to starboard.
As long as he's been here....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
What?
Shit....
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
So far..
Lots of times....
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
The shark will get it for us.
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
Okay...we got it together....
When I invited you...
When I got the grant.....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
Gave them the day off....
Down here....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
Holy shit!
What?
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
Stop busting my hump....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
You're afraid of the competition out there....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
Money is money....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
Bad boy....
Where the hell's the beer...?
They won't fight with me....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You didn't stick them on right....
I made them, man....
The readings suck....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
We'll pass around cigars....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
You tagging them...?
How many...?
Try the area around the wreck....
Stop farting around....
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
Woman has taste....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
She's in management....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Happy birthday, darling. ...
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Who grows more beautiful....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
