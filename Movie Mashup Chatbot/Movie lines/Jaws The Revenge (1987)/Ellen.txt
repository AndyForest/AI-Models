You make sure they come?
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
Beginning of what?
All he did was kiss me....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
I'd be afraid of losing....
You caught me....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
I can't help it....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I like it.  Really....
I'm not on vacation....
Don't be late.
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
He heard that.
I'm on the phone....
The fish.  Check it....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
Are you all right?
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
I see what you're doing....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
That....
Stop that....
I'll miss you....
I'll be in to read you a story.
Thanks for the consultation....
I almost forgot....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
You're coming, aren't you...?
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
Thank you....
I never....
It's too dangerous....
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
Yes!
In a minute....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
Promise me....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Why'd you come out here?
You hungry?
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
You and Sean used to make....
You look tired....
It's late....
Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
I enjoy his company....
I am.
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
You could teach...You could....
I want you to give up your work....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
I'll be all right, Michael.
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
How are you doing?
I'm fine....
You were a monkey....
I didn't mean to start that....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
I don't want you in the water anymore....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I want you to get out of the water....
You guys must be starving....
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
I can't....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
You sure you don't need glasses?
The whole idea is preposterous....
I'm sorry...I....
Why?
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Won't you get in trouble...?
What?
You're always taking time off....
That's hard to imagine....
I have my own little island.
Good.  I have two left....
You'll be sorry.
No!
You're not going to bet it all....
A big one....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
You promised me a drink....
I'm terrific... Come on....
I'm fine.
Nothing....
It's wonderful....
The plane's turning....
You're impossible....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
Where do I pull off...?
What are you doing?
I don't know how....
I can't....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Doesn't matter....
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
It was no accident....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
Flies the plane....
Can you just go off...?
You must get bored easily.
No....
