I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
Where's my mother?
Where is she?
Sweetheart....
It went away....
But it went away...We would have known....
What's wrong?  What happened?
They're at the beach....
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
Off....
Turn it off....
No fair, I'm not armed.
What the hell are we arguing about?
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
How come it's my responsibility?
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
I'll be right there.
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
Make a list.
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
It sure is....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
No way....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
Nowhere....
It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
Promise me you'll be all right....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Why'd you take the boat?
It got him....
No.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
I don't want to talk about that.
There's nothing to worry about....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
I have to get this finished.
I'm fine....
Trying to write our report....
You just got here....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
Good.
You're not a pain in the ass....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
You're having a good time....
I'm not going to quit now....
Mom, please don't start that again....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
Good.  So will I....
Okay.
All you all right?
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
Come on, I'll show you around.
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
I'm just getting started....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
What?
Sit down, Ma....
Mother....
It needs more time to charge.
What happened?
Come on, Hoagie....
Can't this thing go any faster?
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
I wish there was something I could do....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
Inch by inch....
We'll be done pretty soon....
Still chasing fish?
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Matt?
Jake.
It's my fault...I have to....
I'll do it, Jake.
Your equipment has crapped out again....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
It'll work....
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
I've got to get to her....
Mom....
Screw you, Jake....
I don't like the song.
Stop that!
Shove it....
Shit....
'Snuck up on me....'
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
Funny, Jake...Funny.
How come only me?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
You getting a reading on them?
I'm going down, Jake....
I didn't ask you to....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
I'm coming...How close is it?
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
Maybe it's gone....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
I am...You must know something about him....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
What's so funny about that?
What do you know about him?
Hoagie.
How long has he been here...?
How long?
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long have you known Hoagie?
What she's got.  Nine knots....
And it's always worked?
You sure you've done this before?
I don't know shit about electronics....
So did I....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
We got it together, Jake....
When I signed on....
When we got the grant....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
What happened to Clarence and...?
Where is everybody?
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
Spade's a garden tool....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
How many?
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
They put bombs on dolphins....
Forget it....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
I didn't do it on purpose....
Maybe I missed you too....
Put me down, damnit....
Put me down....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
Hey!
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
I stuck them on, man....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
The females have eggs....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
Will you leave me alone...?
Stop busting my hump....
