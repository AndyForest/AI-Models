Yes, I did.
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
Come on, sweetheart....
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Don't bother Hoagie....
Thea....
You'll spoil her.
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
I don't know....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
You knew...?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
Thea was attacked by a shark....
Where have you been...?
Close the door.
I have work....
No....
Then don't come any closer.
I don't know...You...I don't know.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Because....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Tell Matt he should be here....
We need beer....
We need milk....
We forgot to stop at the store.
It sure is good to be home....
Like mother, like son....
Chicken....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Where are you going?
He was doing his job....
He told me you both did....
We'll be there....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
Whatever happens next.....
It's beginning....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
You want to try your hand at something...?
You're not interfering, Ellen....
Henny Youngman....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
It'll grow on you.
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
