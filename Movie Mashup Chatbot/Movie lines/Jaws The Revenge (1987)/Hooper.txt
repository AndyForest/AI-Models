You too, Michael....
Let me speak to Ellen....
Feathers all over the place....
Oh, boy....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
She's a tough lady....
How's Ellen?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Still tagging conch?
Yeah....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
