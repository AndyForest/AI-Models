Yes you can....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
My vision is perfect....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
I borrow it without telling him....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
I like to travel....
I could take some time off....
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
But it gets cold in winter....
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I have two right feet.
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
A big one....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
No, you're not....
What's wrong?
How do you like flying?
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
It's just like driving a car....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
No one does till they learn....
Sure you can....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
Depends on where you want to go....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
It could have been an accident....
I always listen to my feelings....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
Just like that?
You the architect?
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
Want to go for a little ride?
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
I'll get it back next time.
I have coffee in the thermos.
Aye, aye, Captain....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Grab your socks....
She said it was coming....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
I hope she's a good sailor....
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
What's that....?
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
Good news travels fast....
