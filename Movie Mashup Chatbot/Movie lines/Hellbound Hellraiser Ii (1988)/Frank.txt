Julia.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Shit. Bull. Shit.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
