You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Just get out of your vehicle...
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Who prescribes the brandy?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
