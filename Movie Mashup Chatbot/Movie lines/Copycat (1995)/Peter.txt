Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor?  That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick.  So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you?  Death is the only cure for people like me.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then...
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
No.  Not yet.
You know where.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Oh, I think you will.
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
<u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
