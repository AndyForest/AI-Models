What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
I don't have it...
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
You get me out first.
I never carried a gun!
I never hurt nobody...
I was?  How you spell that?
Who are you?
She's supposed to have it.
The door was already open...
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
