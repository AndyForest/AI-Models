Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
You bastard!
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
You're fired.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Get out!  All of you!
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
I can't, Andy.
About what?
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
I want to die.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
Andy?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
Yes.  I believed him.
When he was seventeen.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
The first two murders.
The same as the first time...
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
I thought he was lying.
He was lying.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
Yes.  Without question.
In jail.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
What book?
Hello, Daryll Lee.
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
You know I can't do that.
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
Where are you, Peter?
Who was the man in the basement?
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere. What does he do?  Nothing.
Maybe you should...
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Who's the married man?
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
What happened to you?!
You do that one, I don't want it...
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
Why should I trust you?
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
Is that it?
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
Ruben.
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Then what do you need me for?
That's no surprise.
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Is it an ongoing case?
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
If he's not out, why are they here?
Is he out?
I think this is number three...
You're calling me a crank?
Who is this?
What else?
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
He was in my apartment!
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
Go and look for a note.
Is there a phone booth there?
Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
Don't hang up!
She on the passenger side?
It's a woman shot in a car?
Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
The lock...
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
Are you always so bold?
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
He can get into my computer any time he likes!  This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
I don't want this.  What are they?
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
