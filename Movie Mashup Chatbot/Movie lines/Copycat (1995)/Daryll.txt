That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
You come and visit.
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
