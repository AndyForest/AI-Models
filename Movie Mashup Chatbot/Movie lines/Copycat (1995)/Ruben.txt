A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Fear of what...
What did I do?
I hate this...
None of your fucking business.
She don't want it.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
Where is it?
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
You know how to use this?
I know, baby.  I know.
Open the door.  Please.
They all have one...
Yes.
<u>What</u>?...
Yes.  I have to go...
I'll get a locksmith.
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Tell me what to do!
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Not yet.
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
Let me get a little action started here.
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Talk to Nikko...!
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
What's Abba?
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Look at him, grandstanding...
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
Absolutely.
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
I like women like that!
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
What's wrong with him?
You came in there with this attitude...
Classy madonna.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
