It's good medicine.
Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Now look what you did.
Only kidding!
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
Hal has it.
But </u>alive</u>!
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
Look out for her.  She's tougher than you think.
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
When are you going to call them?
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
What?  What'd I do?
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
When was the last time you washed your hair?
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
Gaahhd!  What a <u>cop</u>!  You busted me!  The new one, in the Marina.  She has a police radio scanner. It's always on.  She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again.  She's obsessed.  She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
