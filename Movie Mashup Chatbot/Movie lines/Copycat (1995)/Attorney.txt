And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
When was that?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
What pattern was that?
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
