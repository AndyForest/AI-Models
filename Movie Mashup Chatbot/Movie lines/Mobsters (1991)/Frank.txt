But if ya can't catch the guys...
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
He was around...
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
How's Bugsy doin'?
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
You ain't even a man yet.
Long as Charlie says.
I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
That's it.
Well...
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
