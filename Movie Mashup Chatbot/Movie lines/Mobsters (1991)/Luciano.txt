Minimum security. You'll have everything but broads.
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
We're asking you to go to prison.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
You've got the public upset, Al.
Poor, yeah.
Tell me about it.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Charlie Luciano.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Who hired the bastard?
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
You got men on Profaci's place?
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Bastard didn't even show.
Which is why he doesn't need us.
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
I'm doin' business here!
It always is.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
If I look weak now, it's over.
London?
Gives us something in common.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
Have you thought about this?
You got something to hide?
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Same here.
Something came up.
Luciano.
For what?
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
What's the matter?
You here with Bobby?
For being a bootlegger?
I can just imagine.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
Who?
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
You bastards, I said twenty!
I told you twenty!
I'll do fine.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
How soon can we pull this off?
I'll handle the Boss.
Like Don Maranzano.
Like a party for all our friends.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
Meyer.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
So what is the problem?
Meyer just finished the books.
You fellas got names?
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Not stupid. Fat.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
Not if they all die at once.
They're friends of our enemy.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
You gotta plan these things.
Didn't know you felt that way.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
Where we headed?
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
He's trying to make it.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
Never threaten me, Boss.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
Forget it. That's past.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
They do what I tell 'em.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
I don't fuck my partners.
I'll take care of the Boss.
That's why I'm here.
I found that out.
And the Jews?
I got partners.
What about the share.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
I've got friends.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
The name's Charlie.
Don, I'd be honored.
Not a lot ta know.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
And what do you want out of this?
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Okay. I'm listening.
We can operate around these guys.
We were overdue to get hit.
Masseria's been after me too.
I turned him down flat.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
You wouldn't live out the week.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Forget it.
Jesus.
Come on. Be polite.
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Spare us.
Shuddup.
