The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
And I ain't no nigger either!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
Awwh, Charlie.
But I've never served a day.
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
