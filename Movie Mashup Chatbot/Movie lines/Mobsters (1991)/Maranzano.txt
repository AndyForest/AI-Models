No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
You disrespect our tradition.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
The terms will be mine.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
We learn from life.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
You get fifteen percent.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
He's an animal!
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
And how many soldiers do you have?
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
I must know more of you, my son.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Anything!
Kill them! Kill them!
Luciano is dead?
Yes?
