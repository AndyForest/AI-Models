We could lose the deal!
He's got a line on the good stuff.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
What's that divided four ways?
Can't we get a couple whores over?
The deal's too good, Frankie
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
That ain't what your mama said.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
They don't give a shit about us!
Come off it, Bugs.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Maranzano wants you dead.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Fuck 'em.
Hell. It's been four days!
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Where's the stiff?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
Wanna know what I think?
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
Take any one ya like.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
Best we got.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Just wanted ta say hello.
