You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
The kid just called me stupid.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
But that's an hour's drive.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
What are ya thinkin'?
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
And I got it all planned.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
I know about you.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
What the fuck does that mean?
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
This business is about taking risks.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
See if these two are my friends.
You boys carryin' pieces?
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
I'm glad ya come.
Ya piss like a man.
I like that.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
