What did you wish for, honey?
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
Baby, you're scaring me.
Ben?
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
