I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
Is this about the funny money?
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
I got my sources.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
Master Ching taught me.
