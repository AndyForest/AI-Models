Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
I don't think so...
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
I'm busy at the moment.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
