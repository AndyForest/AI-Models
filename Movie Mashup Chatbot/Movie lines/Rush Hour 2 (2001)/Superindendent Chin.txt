Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Are you okay, Lee?
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
This is still Hong Kong.
