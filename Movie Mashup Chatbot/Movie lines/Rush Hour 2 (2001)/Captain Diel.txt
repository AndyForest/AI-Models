No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
