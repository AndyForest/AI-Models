Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
How much is that?
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
What the hell is that?
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
What?
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
So tell me what you know.
How'd you know?
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
I'd like to see you try.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
So what's your story?
Yeah, that's right.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Lee, you okay?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
I said get on your feet!
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
No.  It's my first time.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
That's right.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
I could use a little vacation.
Some Kung-Pao?
The Plaza Hotel?
New York City?
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
It's okay, I got lots more.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
That your gate down there?
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
We made it, man.
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
Just GO!
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
What?!?!
No you didn't!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
Lee!
I'll give it my best shot.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
End of the line.
Now that I believe.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
Hello, Benjamin.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Very nice.
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Are you serious?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Steamed dumplings?
What about a little king pao chicken?
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
How was the sex?
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
Fine by me.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
It doesn't matter.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
Let me see it again?
I wouldn't do that!!!
Take it!
There's people up here!
I don't need a turn!
Pick it up!
She's walking back towards the door.
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Gimme the binoculars.
What's going on?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
What did you say?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Excuse me?
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
You pull a muscle or something?
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
He'll be back soon.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
It sounds impossible --
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
IT IS CRAZY!
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
Ask me if I give a shit.
Forget it.
You're not very good at this, are you?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
What the hell is going on here?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Who?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Who died?
And you ain't black!
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
What's wrong?
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
How you doin'?
I am a tourist.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
You lied to me.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
What'd I say?
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
I knew you were lying.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
I said that?  Which word was "goat?"
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
Fine with me.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
What "revenge" is he talking about?
