Amen to that, brother.
A little Mu-shu.
First class.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
This money is evidence.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
What is this?
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Yes.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
No problem.
It's worth it to me.
Carter...
We have to get to the Penthouse.
Ricky Tan is alive.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
I did!
MMMMMM!!!!
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
No.  I'm going to find out.
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Dancing?
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
What is Mac out?
Let's go.
Red Dragon.
Vegas...
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Who's Benjamin?
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
No mu-shu.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Mind your own business.
No.
I think we should stop talking.
What's a Chinese heaven?
Yes.  We have heaven.
Fine.
See you in the next world.
Fine with me.
Well we're not friends.
I'm not used to having a partner.
Why did you help me?
Shhh, my head hurts.
She saved our lives.
Are you okay?
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
She never even looked at you.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
It's a bomb.
Get it out of here!
Wait!  There's people down there!
It's your turn!
I don't understand?
What is it?
What?
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
I don't want to hear this.
What's she doing?
No.  It's not right.
She's getting undressed.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
Is it hot in here?
Nothing.  I said nothing.
Slow down, baby.
I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
No.  It was my singing.
It's a long story.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
How do you know?
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
You sound like that all the time.
How do you know he's our man?
Who?
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Follow the Rich White Man?
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Why LA?
You said --
I cannot go to LA...
What?
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
No, no, that would be crazy --
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
Good at what?
No.  She's a school teacher.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
I'm okay, you go.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Not Yu.  You!
You.
Carter?
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
I have plenty of dates.
It's my job!
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Where are you going?
Don't look at my ass!
I'm calling for back up!
This is a very dangerous man.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
Well, hurry up.
What are you doing?
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
Hello.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
This won't take long.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
I'm sorry.
Try to land on your feet.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
I'm sorry.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
Carter, get off that stage!
Bathroom.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
No.
No.
Carter, would I lie to you?
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Those girls drove off because of you.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
I didn't know which side you were on.
Are you okay?
No.  But I'll help you.
How do I know I can trust you?
Why don't you go get them?
Just trying to make it look real.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
What's going on?
Excuse me?
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Is this a payoff?
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Do you still have the bills?
Baby Duck?
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
I'll take him.
Thank you.
Did you tell Sterling?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
The Secret Service?  Why?
It's my responsibility.
Any leads?
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
The police can protect you.
Don't.
You must come with me for questioning.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
I know, Master, but...
Ricky Tan?
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Yes, Master.
