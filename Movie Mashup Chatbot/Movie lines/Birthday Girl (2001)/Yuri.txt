The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
I paid for those guitar cases.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
No I don't.
What for?
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
I'm so sorry.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
He wants the money from your bank.
He wants a lot of money.
He wants money.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
John.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
I understand. I'm so sorry
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
How is bank?
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
Do you believe in love?
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
No. It is too judgmental.
Oh nothing.
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
She says she has a secret to tell.
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
You're asking for my documents?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Good.
Oh.  We are Russian.
He says he feels safe here.
What?
Sorry. You've lost me...
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
