No I haven't.
Leave him!
What are you doing here?
Name it.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Say thank you.
Do you like it?
It is. I did it cooking.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Yes.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
It's enough isn't it?
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
My name's Sophia.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
Maybe you will find out.
Tell me about it.
It's more like a date.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
It's what you came back for.
It's not mine.
I'm sorry.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Something else.
Goodbye.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Thank you.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
You know you can come under the blanket.
What was her name?
Except for Small Eyes.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
I'm trying to quit.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
She's alive?
What?
I'm sorry.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
What happened between you and the blonde?
Not really. Maybe a little.
No.
No.
I don't have nothing.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
I wasn't saying anything.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
You are throwing me out.
Excuse me?
You don't understand you either.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You didn't mind too much.
You...
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
So now you hate all women?
Why?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
Sometimes neither.
Sometimes.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
And who says what is wrong.
And? What are you saying?
I don't hate you.
We'll pretend it never happened.
Okay we won't talk about it.
You don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
No. But you tend to tie them up.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
He will come back.
But, you know, so what?
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
It's none of your business.
I don't want to talk about him.
I said I don't have any.
I don't have any money.
Yes.
What?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
Where's the restroom?
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I know you just want to punish me --
No I don't.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
So what are you going to do?
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
You don't understand anything.
They go.
They go.
They go. John. They go.
"Frenzy".

Yes.
Yes.

Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
