FUCKIN' "A".
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
You know who it is.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
How ya doin', Pete?
You're my man, Pete.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
You will.
Suit yourself, champ.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
You like pornos?
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
What'd I tell ya.
At sixty?
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
All right!
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!!
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
