We saw you that night, Pete.
No... Here he comes.
Out in back.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Pete, what happened to you?
I want to see him.
He didn't come home.
When he went to work, right.
I wouldn't know how.
He won't give his name.
We know that.
What's the matter?
Do you remember?
Coming up.
