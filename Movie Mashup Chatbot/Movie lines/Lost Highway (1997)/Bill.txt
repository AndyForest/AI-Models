No.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Never saw him before in my life.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
The police called us.
You don't look so good.
Sit down.
Sit down a minute.
Do ya good.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Have you made any charges against him?
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
His condition? What do you mean?
The wife killer?
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
You talk to him?
Where's Pete?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
