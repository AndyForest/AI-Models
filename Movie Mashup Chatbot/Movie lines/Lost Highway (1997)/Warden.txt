All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
No.
His physical condition.
Yes.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
We'll get a tail put on him.
What's the word on the street?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Did you ask him who he is?
Where is he now?
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Repeat that, Bill.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
What about yesterday?
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
A headache?
He's not Madison?
Who is this man?
What is this, Rogoff?
