Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
You killed him.
You all right?
You got him.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Are you my man?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Set.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
So, should I call Andy?
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
Pete... Don't...
Yeah.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
I used to.
No... no.
I don't know.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
He'll kill us.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
I'll call you again.
Pete?
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
I can't see you tonight.
It's me...
Okay, baby.
Can I call you?
I want more.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I was here yesterday.
