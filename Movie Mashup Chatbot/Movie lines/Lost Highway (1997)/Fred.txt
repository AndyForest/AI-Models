I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
I like to remember things my own way.
Yes, I thought my wife...
This is our bedroom.
I don't. I don't know him.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Dick Laurent?
Andy, who is that guy?
The first night... Not the last two.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
That's it.
But my head...
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
No, no. I want to go in.
My... My head.
Where's Alice?
That's absurd.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
No... of course not.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
I told you to stay in the car!
He's got some fucked up friends.
What job?
Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
Let's go home.
Just a minute.
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Where would you feel safe?
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
What?
I wish I knew.
Thanks, guys.
So?
All right.
Don't you want to watch it?
What's that? Another tape?
Who the hell owns that dog?
You're up early.
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
I had a dream about you last night...
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
From the club. You didn't answer.
I called, you know.
When you didn't come to the club.
Same one you were reading the other night?
Good book, huh?
Maybe.
Does it say anything on the tape?
Who's it from?
What's that?
That's why I married you.
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
What are you going to do?
