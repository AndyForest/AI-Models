You just gonna let him go?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Yeah, Mack?
Who is it?
That's not Fred Madison?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
