I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
No.
No. Fred hates them.
What is?
Was there?
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
But...
I thought you were getting me a drink?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Why would anyone do something like this?
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
What was that?!!!
What the hell is going on?!
We will.
Two detectives are coming out.
We've got to call the police.
I guess so.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Yeah?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Called? When?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
What night?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
It must be from a real estate agent.
No, nothing.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
A videotape.
Wake me up when you get home.
I like to laugh, Fred.
I thought I'd stay home and read.
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
