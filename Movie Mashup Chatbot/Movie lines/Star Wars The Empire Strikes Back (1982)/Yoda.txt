No ... there is another.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
Will he finish what he begins?
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
Much anger in him, like in his father.
If it must be.  Yes.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
It is the future you see.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Free your mind and return he will.
Only what you take with you.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
That they are.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
That is why you fail.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
You are reckless!
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
