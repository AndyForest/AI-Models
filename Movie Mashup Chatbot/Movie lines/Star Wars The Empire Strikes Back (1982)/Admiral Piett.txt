Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
My lord.
