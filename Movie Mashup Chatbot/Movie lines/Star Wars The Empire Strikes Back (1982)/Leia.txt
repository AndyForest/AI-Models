Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
... the power?
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
What happened?
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
No thanks.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
You look silly.
What are you staring at?
I don't like this.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
Can you trust him?
A mining colony.
Never heard of that system.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
That depends.  Where are we?
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
You're going to attack them?!!!
No lightspeed?
The entrance is collapsing!
But the tremors have stopped.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Are you crazy!
Outside, in the cave.
There's something out there!
I do not!
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Stop that.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Yes, you do.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Where have I heard that before?
They're moving away.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
How do I look?
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
What is it?
Now you're making sense.
I'm against that.
Good.
I take it back.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Probably an asteroid field ....
Or you ran into something ....
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
I don't know what he's talking about.
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
An Imperial probe droid.
What was it?
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
We are fighting for a cause much ...
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
And what are they, pray tell?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Yes.
Han, we need you here.
Does Luke know?
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
That sounds familiar.
Are the coordinates set?
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Luke!
What'd you say?
We've got to find Luke.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
We have no use for your kind.
And when do you betray us again?
What's going on?
... we're the bait.
What about Han?
It's a lovely outpost.
You're part of the mining guild then?
Thanks.
Not really.
You may call me Leia.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
What is it?
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
I understand.
Let's go.
I thought you knew this person.
Well, what now?
What??
A tremor!
Closer?!
You don't have to do this to impress me.
I'll be back later.
You rest now.
This hyperdrive had better work.
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Where are you going?
What did you say?!
Me too.  I was afraid.
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
