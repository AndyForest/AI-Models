The boy is our last hope.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
He'll learn.
He can do it.
We've discussed this before.
He will learn patience.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
... Luke, you must not go.
Luke ... you are the only hope.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
You must survive, Luke.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
