Howls.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Barks a blue streak.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks a doleful farewell.
Barks his concern.
Barks at Han.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Barks his agreement.
Barks his consternation.
Howls.
Barks his �right on!�
Barks his agreement.
Barks at his master.
