I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
It can wait.
Sir, I was wondering ...
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Oh my, no!
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Closer?!
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
