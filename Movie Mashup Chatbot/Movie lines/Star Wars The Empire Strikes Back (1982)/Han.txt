I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
Well, it's been awhile.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
That's right.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
I'm going to see what it is.
You, too, golden rod.
What are you so grouchy about?
We're in trouble!
I think we're in trouble.
Sit down, and shut up!
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
What is it?
... just remember that, �cause I'll be back ...
Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
I was worried about you.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
You look great.
Who's staring?
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Let �er go, Chewie.
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Here ... near the Anoat system.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Where?
Try and control this ...
You mean a man you can control.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
What are you afraid of?
Why?
That's quite a compliment.
You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
That was no earthquake.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Beautiful.
You don't look angry.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
That should do nicely.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
We've got to get out of this shower.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Forget it.
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
Not you?
We?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Yes, Your Highness?
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
Yeah, you're a real hero.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
Luke?  I don't get it.
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
This ought to be good.
Get out of here, Lando!
I'm sorry too.
Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
How's your mining operation going?
Hyperdrive.
Repairs ...
I always said you were a gentleman.
No hard feelings?
