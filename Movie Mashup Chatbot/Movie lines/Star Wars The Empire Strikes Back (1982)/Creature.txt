Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Mine, mine.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
