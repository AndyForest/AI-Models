You won't.
And that is why I must go.
I feel The Force.
I can help them!
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Ben ... Ben ...
I'm cold ... so cold ...
I can't ...
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
Because of my father, I guess.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
You know the Jedi Master?
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Give me that!
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Yeah ...
I'm looking for someone.
... Like we're being watched.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
About what?
Probe?  What probe?
Thanks to you.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
I've never seen it fail.
He'll survive.
Leia!
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
Jabba the Hutt?
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Han's leaving?
What are you talking about?
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
They're my friends.
Will they die?
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
I see a city in the clouds.
My mind fills with so many images.
Ben?  Ben?
What's in there?
I feel cold.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
But tell me why ...
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
Price?  What do you mean?
But I feel The Force flowing!
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
I don't believe it.
I can't. It's too big.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
I thought I was in good shape.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
I have followed my feelings.
Why not me?
Never.
No! .... Never ....
Time will tell.
I'll die first.
No!
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
