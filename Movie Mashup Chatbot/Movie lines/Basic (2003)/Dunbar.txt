You too?
Shut up.  West's dead.
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
What do you mean, alone?
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
He -- He made me do it --
Jesus!
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
You wanna bet?
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
But not Pike's.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Yeah --
Of course --
I apologize --
I didn't shoot West --
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
I'm serious --
He's lying.
That son of a bitch.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
Some.
I'm not telling you what happened.
Okay.
There's no need...
You did Basic here?
I don't know... I like the Army.
I just don't like it.
It's... too slow.
I asked for a policeman.
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
Can't do that now, though, can you?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Would you have believed me?
Yeah.
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
The creek bed --
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
There were six of us...
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
So you killed him?
So did we. Why didn't you come?
West... he's dead.
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Put it down!
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
I... I don't know...
They?
His chest was hamburger --
Full clip to the body --
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
Why... why didn't you tell me?
You're lying --
Why?
Bullshit.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
That's exactly what he says about you.
Oh, come on --
If not you, then who?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
You hated West more than any of us.
Yeah...
You know it's not like that --
We just want to check your pack --
Where have you been, Jay?
What do you mean, West's?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
