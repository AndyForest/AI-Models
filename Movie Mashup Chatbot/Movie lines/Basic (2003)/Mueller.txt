West was one thing, but this --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
I don't know!
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
You killed him you fucking faggot --
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Can anybody hear me!
I...
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Jesus, what happened?
Why?
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Pike and I got separated --
You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
The faggot speaks.
Tell him to shut up --
Shut up!
Bullshit --
The fuck are you talking about --
We're not going anywhere.
I used it to start the fire --
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
What the fuck are you doing?
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
