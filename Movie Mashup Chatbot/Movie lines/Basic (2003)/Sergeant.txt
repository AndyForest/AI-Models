Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
