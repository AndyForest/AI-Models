None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Fine.
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
Shut up, Mueller.
HEY!
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
We found him like this --
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Yeah, right...
We found him like this...
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
We don't know. West is dead.
