--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
I am the desert, where water disappears--
You provoke me, Merlin.
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
You are truly magnificent!
Why?
People make you laugh?
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
A lovestruck page!
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
Can it truly be used for magic?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
