I have kept it.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?

Not you, my husband?
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.

--Nothing!
Love demands it.
To me? But why?
Me?
Who?!
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Why?
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
