I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
Father...
