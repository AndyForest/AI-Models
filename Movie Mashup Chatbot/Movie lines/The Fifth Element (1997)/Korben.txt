And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
When is she not in trouble?
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Good luck..
What kind of mission?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
That's what I thought.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
They all like this in your family, father?
So you do know her.
You noticed...
I brought the girl remember?
She dropped in on me... holding this.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Leeloo... is... she's...
Who?
Leeloo..
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Hello?
Uh... at least fifty.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
I don't need one.
Like shit.
I just found a picture of you.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
At least, the cat comes back.
I was talking to the cat.
Yeah?
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...What's your name?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Vito Cornelius?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
...'Scuse me?
...Ma???
Hello?
...Not yet.
Yeah?
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Other than that... You all right?
Yes ma..
Hi Ma...
...Hello?
Found it?
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
I'm sorry..
Thanks for reminding me..
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Is that all?
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
What did you say? What did you do?
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
It's like a cab isn't it?
I'll be right back.
Not without Leeloo.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Six to the left. One to the right.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
I don't think this is a good time...
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Uh... not really.
...Hi.
Oh, yes you will...
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
It's my wife.
...Shit!
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
I'm not going.
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
I've had enough good news for today
And the third one?
Just one... why me?
Where have I heard this song before?
What mission?
I love you...
Because...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Exactly.
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
It's up to you now, Angel!
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
I told you not to read all that crap!
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
It's difficult.
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
Where you going?
You noticed..
You get that off the screen?
Here we go again...
Uh...
Apipoussan?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Which one?
Finished what?
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Oh god!
You hear that?
Uh..you're welcome.
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
At least I won lunch.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
You're welcome..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Been here long?
