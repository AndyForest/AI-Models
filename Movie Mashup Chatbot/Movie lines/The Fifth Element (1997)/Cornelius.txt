I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
You know exactly where they are!
The case was stolen?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
What're you laughing about?
At your service.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
You are a monster, Zorg!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
They are robots!
No thank you.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
...We're saved!
That's what I'm saying.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Leeloo's in trouble?
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
What are you doing?
Of course.
We have to save the world.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
It means, "Never without my permission".
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
She's an exception..
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
He's a she!
The girl?
Who are you?
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
What are we going to do?
Thank you, Mr. President.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Yes..thank God..
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Where's Leeloo?
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Perfect.
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
Yes. Of course..
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
It's a miracle!!!
