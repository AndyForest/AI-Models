I know...
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
...would you like a drink?
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm fucked!
I'm not at the hotel!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
Got it.
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
No... not at all.  Where are you?
