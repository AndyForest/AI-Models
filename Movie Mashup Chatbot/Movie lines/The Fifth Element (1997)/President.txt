This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Is there anything that can stop it?
And then?
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
One more reason to shoot first eh?
How much time is left?
I want your best man on this!
...What do you mean?
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Gentlemen?
Recommendations.
Options.
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Is that better?
Staedert, do you read me?
