Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
You little sleaze bag!
Have you pulled yourself together?
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
