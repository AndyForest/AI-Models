Frank!
Is he there?
Open it.
I still think you should go down.
Are you going down there?
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Frank?  I'm frightened.
That's right!
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
No!
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
I was talking to Jim.
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Do I have to spell it out?
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Why should you be the only one.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Good Lord!
And you wanted him to make a list!
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
How!
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Goodbye, dear.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
All right, darling.
That's a fine way to behave!
What?
