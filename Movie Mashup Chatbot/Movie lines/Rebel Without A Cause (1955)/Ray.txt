You sure?
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Excuse us a minute?
What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
You don't?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Chicken?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Pretty mixed up?
What?
Things pretty tough for you at home?
But you don't think that's a solution.
So then you moved?
And your folks didn't understand?
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
Try the desk.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
No.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Grandma?
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
She's being called for.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
That one?
Do you think your father means that?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
What?
Judy--we're ready for you now.
