Good luck, Buzz.
Feel okay?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
I'm glad they let you out.
A new disease.
Steady Marlon!
They're killing him!
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
After he tried to shoot you?
We have to go back!
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
I never felt so clean before.
You smell like baby powder.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You don't need to do that.
Are you?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Hi.
I don't know.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
You can't talk underwater!
See, we're very modern.
There's just one thing.  What about--
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
Oh, Jim!
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
I'm never going back.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
Why did you do that?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Why?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
No.
Neither can I.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
I'm numb.
No--I was just--maybe--
It doesn't matter to them.
They'll be looking for you.
Goodbye!  See you!
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
The kids take me.
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Dig the square wardrobe!
You going there?
Won't mother be proud.
Who lives?
Where what was.
"Life is crushing in on me."
Now that's true!
Bully for you.
Hi, Plato!
It's all right.
Plato, where's your father now?
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
What's he like?
Is he your friend?
You said you'd call my father.
My mother?
What?
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
I'll never get close to anybody.
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
No.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
He hates me.
He hates me.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Why?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I was talking to Dad.
I didn't want to stop.
Didn't you forget something?
Good evening.
Daddy--
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
How did you know that?
