Head-shrinker?
In my mother's drawer.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
Plato.
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
I shot at one of them.
Who's that?
Come on!
Why?
You promised to give it back.
I need it.
My gun?
Can I keep it?
No.
You sure?
Here.
Why?
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
I'm fine.
I've got a gun.
I'm here.
Get away from me!
I don't want you for my father!
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
I came here before.
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
Isn't he schizoid?
Man, you're schizoid!
Come on!
There's only one key.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
Isn't it crazy?
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
I'm here.  Shut up.
Help me in!
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
They're looking for you!--
It's me!
Jim!
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
I hitched.
What?
Are you really going to meet them?
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
They're still there!
No.  It's perpetual motion.
He has a knife.
You scared?
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
Plato.  It's a nickname.
What's your name!
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
You shouldn't monkey with him.
What?
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
You remember me?
Hi.
Hi.
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Okay.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Yes.  My best friend.
