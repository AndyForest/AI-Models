Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
Yeah.
Sure.  It's fine.
Hi.
Jim Stark.
Stay there.
Where can we meet?
You satisfied or you want more?
Machismo?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Chicken?
Meaning me?
I'm cute, too.
You watch too much television.
You know something?
He depended on me.
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
I don't want to learn that!
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
You don't want me to go.
Except yourself!
I don't think so--
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
I was in it.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
What can you do when you have to be a man?
We don't have time.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Blood.
What would you do, Dad?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
I'm not hungry.
Yes.
That's funny!
And you dropped it?
Yeah!
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
You make any sandwiches?
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
You can't protect me.
Tell him why we moved here.
I'll wait for him.
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
Plato!
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Just a guard.
They like you.  Okay?
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
What do you think?
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
No.  At dawn.
That's swell.  How are you?
I know.  Light a match, will you?
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
Plato?
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Your father!
Plato!
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Who?
When was that?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
Not lately.
Hey!  How 'bout that!
I'm what?  What?
Let's see how long we can stay under.
We'll take it!
What?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
No.  I'm scared.
Come out come out wherever you are!
Hey where'd you go?
Judy.
We know.
Yeah?
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Who's that!
Yeah.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Who has?
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
No.  It's okay.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
How'd you get here?
What's a chickie-run?
Who knows.  Plato?
No.  In the morning.
I'm here.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
I just don't want trouble.
I know.  That's why I came back.
Jim.  What's yours?
I don't want to make friends.
What?
Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
Boy!
No.  I don't think so--
Hi there.
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Just tell a little white lie?
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
What's that got to do with it?
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Mom--I'm not--
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
'Bye, Mom.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
I'm sorry.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
You serious?
Okay--
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
If he could--
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
What a zoo!
She eats him alive and he takes it.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
They never do.
He called me chicken.
Mess that kid up?
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
I don't know why--!
Leave me alone.
No.
Wash up and go home.
Get lost.
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Plato!
Listen--
Yes, ma'am.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
No!  I got to find him.
No!
It is for me too.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
So do you.
What?
You disappointed?
What a relief!
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Why?
What?
Hi.
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
Should we explore?
How many rooms do you think there are?
Ever been in a place like this before?
I bet you hear everything I say!
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Well--we're newlyweds.
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
You can trust me, Judy.
Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
Where you going?
I felt like it.
Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
Sure.  Lots of times.
I'm getting that way, too.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
You cold?
You still pretty upset?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
I'm not so bad.
A what?
Oh.
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
Yeah--why--
Where's Dawson High School?
You're really flipped--aren't you.
See, I'm new.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
See?
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Hi.  I saw you before.
