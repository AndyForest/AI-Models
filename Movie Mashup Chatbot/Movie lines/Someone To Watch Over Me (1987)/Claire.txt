Occasionally.
It's terrific Win.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
You didn't like him?
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
Hello, Win.
Say goodbye, Mike.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I'll miss you, Mike.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
I don't know...
So.
Everyone's all right...?
Mike...?
... Mike.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
"To"... Forget about you.
Long enough.
... Don't explain.
I know.
I know.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
Do you?
What a memory.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Oh God, that's great!
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
What do you want to do?
You told her?
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
They called here after you left...
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Let go!
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
You put me life in danger.
I can't open it.
What do you want?
Good night, Mike.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
I'll miss you, Mike...
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
Tell it like it is.
You don't like him, do you?
But "nice".
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
And "is"...?
So it was "love".
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
So, this could be your last night, huh?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You were reading my Renoir.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Urdu and Hindi.
Hmm...
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
He said he'd kill me.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Listen, that was my fault.
Yeah.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
Let's get a drink.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Put it on my account, please.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Would you pick one out, please?
Are you nervous?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.
You live in Manhattan?
What did he say?
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
There's a phone in the car.
Can we go then?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Straight ahead.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Not if you don't want me to.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
And I'm making mine.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
... I don't want to talk about it...
