Tommy...!
Absolutely.
I don't know Tommy.
Sure we are, let's go!
Nothing.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
I'm all right.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
What's the difference?
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
I watched TV.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What was that?
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
Did you hear what I said?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Mike, take it easy...
What?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Coming to bed?
Why?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
She took you shopping for a tie?
It's not your taste.
Where'd you get the tie?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
I'd identify him.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
She's got to identify him.
Honey.  You got him.
What shit, honey?
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
I can still use a gun.
For how long?
So how'd it go?
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
My ass is falling.  It is.
My ass if falling.
Mike?
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Too kinky.
