You take care.
I do.
I like your coat.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
You don't have to, now.
You still going away?
So.
Yeah.  It's all over.
Claire!
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Yeah...
"For"...?
How long you going away for?
I'd miss my life...
It wouldn't work.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
They guys treatin' you all right?
Pretty bad.
Do you dance?
I'll think about Wednesday.
Claire...
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
When can I see you?
Where?
Oh that thing in Queens.
Are you okay?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
You don't want to know.
I don't know.
Not exactly.
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
I don't know you...
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
Yeah.
I do care about you!
Stop being nuts!
Stop, will you?!
Claire...!
Claire, will you calm down?
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
Open the door, will you?
Claire?
Sleep good.
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
You could do better.
You asked.
What's to like?
What about Neil?
Very nice.
No dog.
No dog.
Yeah.
Yeah.  It was.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Could be, I guess.
No kidding.
They're kind of fuzzy.
How did you know?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Yeah, what a woman.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Claire?
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Sooner, the better.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
I'm sorry about what happened.
You all right?
I came on at 8:00.
I'll come with you.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Not too sure about that.
I got money.
Beg pardon?
No, Ma'am.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Queens... You know Queens?
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
I'm supposed to call in.
Right.  That's true.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Uh...
Hi.
Hard to find doors in this place.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Me neither.
Ellie...
No.
What about Tommy?
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
Let me drive...
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
You talked to his wife?
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
What did you watch?
What did you do tonight?
I'm sorry.
What're you talking about --
You heard me.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
Did you hear what I said?!!
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
I'll be right up.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
She bought it.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Ellie, it was a formal party...
I had to follow her to a store.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
What did she say the down payment was?
Bought it.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
I might stop you.
I think -- she's crazy.
Why?
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
You don't want to hear about it.
Oh, some shit.
Okay?
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Hey.  The neighbors.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
You got no idea...
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
Get in bed.
What are you talking about?
Your what...?
What?
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
It should've been me...
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
What about when she identifies him?!
Even Joey Venza?!
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
What about when she goes out?
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
I just sat and listened.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
No, I need'm now!
Koontz!  I need you guys!
At my house...!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Not Koontz.
You in this with me?
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Who's Joey Venza?
Right behind you, T.J.
... Hard?
Yes.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
Is she injured?
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
No, sir...
Watch your step!
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Let my kid go.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
I'll prove it!
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
Take care, pal.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Shooting?
So, what are you doing tonight?
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
She's what?
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
How about dinner tonight?
How are things going, pal?
Yeah, I think so.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
How do you know where the gun is?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
