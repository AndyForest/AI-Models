She's not alive, but she didn't die.
She grew up.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.

I am going back.  I see myself there.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
The other two will die without me.
I have to go back.
Where are we going?
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
Please, I want to go back...
Anderton --
What is it?
Please --
Anderton, leave.
Wait.
He won't.
No.  Follow him.
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Drop some money.
Can you see the balloon man?
Take it.
They're inside.
Is it now?
Is it now?
Can you see?
