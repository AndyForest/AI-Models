Hold your breath, Dad...
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Good-bye, Dad...
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
Once I even told him I loved him.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
Wanna hear something funny?
You gotta have faith, Dad.
Come on!
Okay... now let me time you.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
I won!
I scored a goal!
