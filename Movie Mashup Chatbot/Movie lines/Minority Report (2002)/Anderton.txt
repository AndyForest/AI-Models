What --
Oh, Jesus...
She's still alive?
She died?
Who wanted her little girl back?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Why?
Someplace safe.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Oh, God...
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
I can't.  I have to know.
He's here.
Agatha...
He'll turn around.
Forget that guy --
What?
Agatha --
Agatha...
Who?
What?
What?
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Wally!
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
Anne Lively...
Because I found out about her...
Somewhere.
Just some guy... they found.
-- but he didn't.
-- go blind.  I know.
The nano... what?
I can't even stand up --
How do I find the --
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
You set your patients on fire!
You made those tapes...
I put you away --
From where?  D.C.?
We know each other?
It's all I could safely move.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Yeah --
Right.  I know --
That's comforting.
Lara --
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Try again.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
... Graveyard shift.
You the only sentry?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Victim's a white female.
Drowning.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
You the sentry?
Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
Everybody runs.
I'm not getting halo'd.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
Can you fake the cerebral output?
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
We won't let them.
I'm fine, Lamar.
I go running down there.
I'm fine.
What?
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
Yes, sir.
I understand.  Sir.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Hang on, Lamar --
Uh-huh...
Don't worry, Lamar.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Everybody runs.
I show a cop on horseback.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
You're kidding, that's today?
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Take your time.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
Confirm with trig and image.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Red Ball?
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Go back to work.  All of you.
Uh-huh.  Jad?
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
Did Marks close the front door?!
Did he close the front door?
Now look at him...
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Georgetown.
No maglev system.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Run the subscription list...
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
You gonna tell on me?
You set me up...
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Just a nickname.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
To Hineman?
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
You're certain?
Why did you catch that?
Yes, it is.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Just go to the beginning!
Are these all of her previsions?
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Wally, listen to me...
She said...
She spoke to me.
She was looking right at me.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
Rufus, play it back...
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Stop --
They don't belong to anybody.
So now I need you to hack into her.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
That's right.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
I need help with her.
I need your help.
Sean, wait...
Who are you?
I wanted to.
I was looking for you...
I forgive you...
I forgive you.
Sean --
Oh, Sean --
You're alive?
What the hell.
It's a little late for that.
Sean -- you're not real.
All right, I'll try...
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
That's great.
Good-bye, Crow.
Let go of the gun.
Tell me!
Who made you do this?
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
What about the picture --
What the fuck is going on?
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Who said I would?
The precogs were wrong.
No.
NO!
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
He's alive?
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
Do you know who I am?
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Which one is that?
How do I even know which one has it?
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
You're insane or you think I am.
-- and then walk out.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Where?
What safe place is that?
You said they're destroyed.
Why should I trust you?
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
You want to bring it down.
I believe in that system...
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Why?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
What?
So you won't help me?
Not if I stay away from him.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
You say some of the children died?
And how did Lamar become involved?
You're talking about the precogs...
Heal who?
You don't seem all that proud.
What's so funny?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
I'm... not... a... killer.
The what?
I'm a little dizzy...
