John?  What is it?
I know... I do, too...
About who?
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
Found?  Where?
Then who was he?
Then how did he --
Oh, God, what did you do?
John?
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Lamar --
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
He also said Crow was a fake.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
I thought you were retiring?
You look great.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
I haven't seen him in two years.
To what?  Trap him?
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Yes.
It was nobody's fault.
Since right after we lost our son.
That was our apartment.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
No.
I don't have any sugar either.
We used to, every summer.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
Yes.
I know who you are.
