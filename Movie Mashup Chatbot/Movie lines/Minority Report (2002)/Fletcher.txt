You don't have to do this, Chief.
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Uh, sir...
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
Seventeen minutes.
How many?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
I don't know, why?
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
We can stop him.
Two?
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
They're everywhere.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
What?!
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
John Anderton was my friend!
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
Knott!
I think you're swell company, Knott.
