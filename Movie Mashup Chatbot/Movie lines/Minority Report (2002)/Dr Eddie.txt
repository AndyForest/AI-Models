I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Here --
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
They were performance pieces.
Yes, you did.
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
Oh, yes.
You don't remember me, do you?
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
That's not much.
Whatever you say, John.
Why?
And replace them with new ones.
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
