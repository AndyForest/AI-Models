If I find anything I'll call you.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
You got to be crazy.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Marty, what are you doing here?
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
