Get out of here!
Can't shut em' down from here.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Bomb?
Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
What?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
You just keep an eye out.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
You got that right.
Not a chance.
Yllo, what's your head count?
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
My job.
Jesus what the hell is that?
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
You're a teacher.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
We need weapons.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
I'm with you kid.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Kicker, anything?
Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Jesus, God!
I'm pulling, damnit!
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Give me a break! What happened?
Where is everybody? What happened?
