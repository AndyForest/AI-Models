Hey, easy now.
Boeman, the ships not here.
Earth II.
It bought us some time.
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Then what do we do?!
Then stop talking and work faster!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
How many?
We'd need charges.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
You okay?!
Rizzo, pull away!
I know you.
Did you like it?
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Rizzo, you okay?
You'll be fine.
You wanna release your air tanks?
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
You?
See? We're not so bad.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
And what happend to ...?
Were you close to your father?
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
That's why I'm here.
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Rizzo?!
What if we don't?
We're screwed!
Med-kit?
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
No you don't!
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Rizzo, he's out there.
Outta here?
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Where are you going?
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
Oh I like her a lot.
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
That's really funny.
She needs a little time.
Spunky . . .
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Now what?
Shut up, Thorgan!
Well, do something!
I'll help you in.
Okay?!!
Again?! Jesus!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
He's right behind us!
We're screwed.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
NO!
They'll make it.
You lost the charge?
Push off toward us.
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
GO, GO, GO!
And what's with the headgear?
