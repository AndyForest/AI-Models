Sergeant!
But I didn't see...
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Yeah yeah. Got it.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
Wait a minute...I need...
Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
What the hell are you doing?
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
I am an expert!
Get them in the lab!
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
Well?
She broke my fucking nose!
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
It's time.
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
Thank you.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
Just get us to the ship!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
I'm missing two!
Crutch?
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Jesus!
Later.
No! He's coming with us!
Kicker!
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
We're missing two of the kids!
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
I'm sending you the files.
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
You're crazy!
4You're not going anywhere.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Are we locked down?
You're not going anywhere.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
Azrael can you repeat that?
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
That's right, now if you could...
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Nanotechnology.
Obviously so.
