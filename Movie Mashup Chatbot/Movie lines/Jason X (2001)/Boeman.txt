Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Minimal.
What?
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
We don't have a choice!
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
What are you doing?!!
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
Could you show a little compassion?!
Goodbye old friend.
We're not leaving Crutch!
What do you mean, not enough time?
Duck fuckers?
Sergeant!
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Rizzo did.
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Where the hell were you?!!
Where have you been?!!
Thorgan, pull us in.
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Uh-oh.
Thorgan, suit up.
Let's move out!
Two more charges to go.
What are you doing back?!!
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
I'll need system four converters.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
Shit!
Everyone okay?
Better let me.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
And you said high school was boring.
Creepy.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Suit up.
And now we're all out of it.
Hurry!
I don't know!
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Where is...?
Thorgan? You coming?!
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
We could convert fission transistors.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
