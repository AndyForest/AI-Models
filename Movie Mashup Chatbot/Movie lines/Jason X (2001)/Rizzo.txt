Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Delongpre! Out of time!
Done?
We made it?
I don't know. Nothing.
His mother?
Can we blow it with just two?
We can't lead him into the other hull!
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
What's that?
No.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
It's locked!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
We don't have time to argue!
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Where is he?
I get it.
Old woman?
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
I'm stuck!
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
I think so, why?
I think I had some when I was eight.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Okay, good tip.
Eat me.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Oh sure, all the time.
Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Not so bad.
I couldn't save them.
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
I thought you meant...
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
What's this?
Hey!!
Hey.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
What if you miss?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
I guessed.
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Guys!!! The shuttle?
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
I hope so.
We have to get off this ship.
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
You killed him?
Are there any other shuttles?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Barbie from hell...
Robot huh?
I gotta go back.
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
Then open the doors!
Keep trying!
I just know.
Ssh.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
Three...two...one...
How do you open the damn door?
Guys, please come with me!
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
More soldiers?
What good will that do?
You wanna die?
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
Get him out of there!
I didn't say he was alive.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Are you finished?
Jason? He's on this ship?!
But...I...400 years?
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
30? How long was I out?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Guys, he's right behind us!
Can we get through these?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
What have I done?! Idiots.
Old Earth?
Hockey player? He's not a ...
