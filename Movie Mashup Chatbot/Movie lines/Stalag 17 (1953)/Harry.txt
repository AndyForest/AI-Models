It's a mouse trap.
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
You should live so long.
Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
Jawohl!
Then droppen Sie dead!
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Say, Schulz --
No. I want to draw.
Let me do it, Hoffy.
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Why, sure!
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
You're crying, Animal.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
I'll open mine now.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
It's not good for you, Animal.
What do they always say?
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
Bombs away!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
So what? There's other women!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
No, Animal.
Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
Betty Grable!
You want Betty Grable!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Shut up, Animal!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
