You want to go?
Betty! Betty!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
May I have this dance, Miss?
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
It's that song, Harry!
Let me alone.
I'll open mine, too.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Do Grable.
Grable, not Gable!
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
That's what I wanna hear.
What do those broads say?
Harry -- I'm blind!
She'll never forgive me!
You did?
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
You'll fix me up!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
He's the grrrrreatest!
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Where'd that come from?
No?
You're teasing me again!
Me? What if she don't want me?
What's the award?
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
Let me go!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
Let me go! Let me go!
Lay off! The blonde is mine!
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
You can say that again!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Stop it, Harry!
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Oh.
Yeah?
Just what makes you so popular?
Nothing for Kuzawa?
You can tell Father Murray to --
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
You heard him.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Have a nice time over there?
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
Is it all right if we smell it?
A chicken?
