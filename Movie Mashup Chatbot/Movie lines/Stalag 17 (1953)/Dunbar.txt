Let's!
What are the chances busting out of here?
It's on me.
Yeah.
Not you.
Sefton!
My legs are frozen.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Twenty-five.
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
I'm okay here. Why bother?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
I'll live.
105-353.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
