We did not.
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
What's wrong with him?
They never caught on.
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Is you all little Adolfs?
Is you all good Nazis?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!

And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Any news on Dunbar?
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
