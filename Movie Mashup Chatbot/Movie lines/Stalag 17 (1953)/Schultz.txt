You are talking crazy!
Which one of you is what?
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
And this?
What is this? This is water?
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Some are not bad at all.
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Jawohl.
Jawohl?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Give me the radio.
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
No! No!
I do not want those cigarettes.
What guy?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Fine -- fine!
Good morning, Sefton.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
That is my wife.
This is me in Cincinnati.
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Russian women prisoners?
