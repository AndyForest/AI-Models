Brother, were we all wet about you!
We're looking at it.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Thanks.
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
You make my mouth water.
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
And maybe a little something else?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
You stink, Sefton!
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
How much more do we have to take from him?
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
Okay, Security -- what happened?
I'll call the whole pot.
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
Don't wear it out!
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
