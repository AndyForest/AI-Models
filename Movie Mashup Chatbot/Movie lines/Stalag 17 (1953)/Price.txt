Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
What's the match gag?
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Why the south latrine?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
What about Schulz?
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
What are you going to do?
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
Not yet.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
The what?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
December seventh, forty-one.
I'll kill you for that!
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
What did you say?
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Are you questioning me?
Thirty-fifth.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Ich weiss alles.
We have no radio.
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Which one of us is the informer?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
