You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Plenty.
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Get going on the trap door.
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
Okay. Move on.
Ready?
Come on!
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Then we're all in on it?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
How did he get over there?
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Break it off!
Come again?
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Any objections, men?
We've all done a poor job of it.
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
We'll take care of Schulz.  Come on.
Good.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
What radio?
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Shoot!
What's the decoy?
You taking Dunbar?
What are we going to do with him?
Go on.
You off your rocker?
Who did?
How do they know?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
You starting that again?
Okay, Price. You stay.
Right.
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
You heard that, Sefton?
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
We did it.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
Lay off, Sefton.
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
Says me.
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Are we boring you?
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
Stay out of it, Sefton.
