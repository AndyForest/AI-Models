What?
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
The sensitive type.
Was that her top?
Shit!
What is it with this guy?
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Dead.
Yeah? Display?
Did you talk to him?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
And what's he do?
Who's that?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
No. No one special.
Revenge.
Hmmm.
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Mm-hmm.
I'm taking over a TV network.
Yeah, mom?
I found it! I found it!
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
That's bullshit.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Blow me.
Shit! Come on!
Nah. I don't play well with others.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
We did it!
Oh, shit! He got me.
Okay. Let's go shopping.
Fucked if I care, man.
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
It nibbles. You see this?
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Burn!
How did you know that?
Razor and Blade.
What's going on?
No.
Crash Override.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Wanna go for a swim?
You look good in a dress.
Yeah.
What?
I'm trying to help you.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
Yeah.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
Shit!!
I'll hack the Gibson.
I'll make it up to you!
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
I didn't know what was on it.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I know, I know who wrote it.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
I have to tell you something.
Kate, listen.
Okay. I'll copy it.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Do my ears deceive me?
And you have to smile.
Make it our first date.
And if I win?
Your slave?
Name your stakes.
Yeah.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Yeah. RISC is good.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
It has a killer refresh rate.
Yeah?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
I'm Crash Override.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
I said give me time.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
I'll give it a shot.
That's a nice score for a girl.
Yeah! Sure.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Homicidal?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Excuse me.
