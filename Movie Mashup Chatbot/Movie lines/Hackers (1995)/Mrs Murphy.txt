And unpack.
Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
What did we learn in school today?
How was school?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Up all night again, huh?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
What are you doing?
Dade?
