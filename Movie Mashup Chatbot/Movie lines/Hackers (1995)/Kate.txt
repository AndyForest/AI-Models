Go fix the phones.
Cereal.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Dreams?
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
I can't believe they decided you won.
You would have looked better.
Oh, wow, she's great.
Thanks for your help.
Dade.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Alright, let's boot up.
Ready?
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
There they are!
Alright, so what have we got?
It's my subway defense system.
How?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Why did he come to you?
You what?
What?
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Uh, hold on...
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
We need your help.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
You're not gonna win.
Make it my first born.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
If I win, you become my slave.
Are you challenging me?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
It's too much machine for you.
What the hell are you doing?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
What?
He's not enrolled in this class.
He's not in this class.
What the hell is going on?
Think you can do better?
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
No, you're not in my class.
Here's your class.
You think they're going to bust us?
Phreak?
Hello?
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
What is he doing in here?
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
