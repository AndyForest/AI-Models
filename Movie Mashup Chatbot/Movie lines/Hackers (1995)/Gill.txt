Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
How's it going, Ray?
You're welcome.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
We caught 'em.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
I think we've got something.
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
