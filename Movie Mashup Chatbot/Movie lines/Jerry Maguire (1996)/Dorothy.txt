Still going.
He's asleep, right?
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
I think we made a mistake here.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
I don't know --
I don't need you to "stick."
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
It's my fault.
Why do you love me?
Okay... I will...
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Fine, I just --
Oh God.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Good night.
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Maybe you should call her.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Oh good.
I'm relieved you said that.
Yeah, what happened there.
You don't have to explain.
Plus, you could use that commission.
Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Good evening.
I may not sue.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Yeah, I did.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Well.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Truth?
-- especially one like this.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Beer okay?
Sure --
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Too bad.
Oh my God.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Hey you.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Call me later, hon.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Well, I'm happy for you.
I just got goosebumps.
We are?
... light.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
That took guts.
Absolutely.
No no, I know --
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
Oh tsht. Yes.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Oh no.
And have fun at your bachelor party.
Well, thanks.
My son... my mind...
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Oh, tell the story.
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
Please, if I start talking --
No--
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Thanks.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
As opposed to twenty angry women?
That's the girl I love.
Thank you.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
He's coming over.
Wait. Where is he?
Of course I know --
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
