And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
Thanks for coming.
Jerry!  You made it --
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Beautiful.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
I think so.
Why not --
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
That's an answer.
I'm sorry I asked.
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
I'm asking you a question --
You don't want to go home, do you?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
No.
I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
Well, this was another way to go.
You never had The Talk, did you?
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Good deal, man.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
No tell me. _ 84.
What's wrong.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
You're telling me to dance.
Is that your porty or mine?
No, I air-dry.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
--  the kwan.
Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
You are not allowed to act this way.
No.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Huh?
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
You love me now, don't you?
I might call you later!
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
Let's do it again.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
