Oh Jerry.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
No one has ever dumped me.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Didn't hear it.
No.
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
I have to finish my job --
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Oh honey.  It's spun.
I just heard.
Jerry!  Do something --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
You are not a loser.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
Ugh!
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Who told you?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
Don't ever stop fucking me!
