You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Murderer?  Really?
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
Thank you for sharing that charming image.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
