Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
You don't smoke.
Feeling great.
Where we going?
What day is it?
They... they shot me.
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
Dean Martin.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
What?
What's the plan?
That's sick.
Wh... what... ?!
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
That's them trying to kill us.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
No offices are gonna be open today.
Where you gonna be?
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
I got him.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
I'm just saying...
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
Jiminy Christmas.
We should slow down.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
No you can't.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
That wasn't my fault.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
You shouldn't litter.
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Lay off once, would you?
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
She's fine, as if you cared.
He tried to kill us.
Bummer.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
You could start over again with cash like that.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
General Jim Beam, then.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
I'm waiting till the time's right.
You're lying...
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
Can't you say something nice once?
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
Then, why'd we tie him up?
No, we're stealing.
I can't believe we're stealing.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
Where we going?
How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
What the... ?!  What was that for?
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
What was I supposed to do?
That's him alright.
Hey...
It doesn't say that.
What's mine say?
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
Bullshit.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Wha... ?
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
