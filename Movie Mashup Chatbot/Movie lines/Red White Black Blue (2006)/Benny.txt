I don't know, okay?  All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Kittle...
