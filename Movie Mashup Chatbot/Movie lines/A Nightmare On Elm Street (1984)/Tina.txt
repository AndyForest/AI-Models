What you dream?
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Yeah, nuts.
Rod says the sweetest things.
When did you have a nightmare?
No more fights.
Jungle man fix Jane.
Of course. What's that?
What the hell you doing here?
