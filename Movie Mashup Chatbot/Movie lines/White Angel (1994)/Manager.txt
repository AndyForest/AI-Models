This must be one of the old keys -
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
No - not all the time - I mean
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
That's right...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
Yes it is...
BRIAN...
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
