I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
It's been what, three years?
ANGEL...
Yes - one please.
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Dead?
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
Dr STECKLER?
