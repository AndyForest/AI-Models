Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Can I help you?
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Not classic, no.
I suppose so.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
That's right -- Topol.
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
Who?  Someone famous?
Cappuccino as ordered.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
