That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
And what would you say...
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
The truth is...
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
Sorry about that.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
You were saying...
What's the thing?
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
Thank you.  Shall I...
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Hello.
Okay.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
That's spectacularly unfair.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You do?
That's not true.
I don't know what happened.
How are you doing?
Undressed like this, yes.
Don't ask.
Stay forever.
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Who was Gilda?
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Well...
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Wow.
No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
Oh please sod off.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
You have a stunt bottom?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
No.  What's that?
Yes.  Always have had.
With a goat playing a violin.
You like Chagall?
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Yup.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
Cartwright.
Eleven.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
Well done you.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Oh no no -- no.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
This is the place.
Come in.
I think goodbye is traditional.
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
Your boyfriend?
Why?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
No, you were brilliant
I'm sorry.
She saw through me.
She left me.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
Exactly.  Here we go again.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
No, I didn't.
Nothing.
Whoopsidaisies.
Ahm...
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
I thought you were leaving.
That's fine.
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Okay.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Are you busy tonight?
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Absolutely fine about it.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
I brought these, but clearly...
Hi.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Here we go.
Oh right.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Orange juice -- probably not.
Coffee?
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
Here, let me help.
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
Sorry about that...
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Fine.
Yes, I think that one may be.
Tony -- what do you think?
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Bella -- this is Anna.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Is Miss Scott staying here?
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
What?
Yes -- sort of...
Bernie.
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Da Vinci?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Is this your first film?
What do you think?  Good move?
Well, thanks, that's great.
Blimey.  What's that?
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Ahm... Bernie.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
Right.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
I'll see what I can do.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Ahm... room service.
This is Henry James film?
Yes?
The others?
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
I agree.
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Any bit in particular?
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Martin -- your customer.
Right -- want another one?
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
So it could have been neither of them?
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Topol.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Oh God no.
No, don't think I do.
I believe I have.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
She's perfect, perfect.
Really?
Buggered?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
No -- did you?
So I get the brownie?
Definitely no comment.
No, it doesn't.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
Max.  This is Anna.
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
How about Miss Flintstone?
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Hello.
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
No, no.  She doesn't.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Right -- let's talk about rent...
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Right.
Was it you?
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Just take my work for it.
I wouldn't go outside.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Spike!
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Yes.
Yes.
Maybe.
Spike.
Oh my God...  Hello.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Sort of.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
What?
Which was?
What did she say?
Right.  No one else?
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Two?  That's it?
So -- any messages?
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Hi...
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Good luck.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
What are the choices?
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Fabulous.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Oh.  Right.
Are you sure you...?
Which floor?
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
The one down your trousers.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
Bad news.
Excuse me.
