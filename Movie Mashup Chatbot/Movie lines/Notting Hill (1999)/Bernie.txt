Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
... get fired.
No.  Not true...
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
The movie star?
Anna Scott?
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
That's nice.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
And we intend to use them!
Shame!
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
