What happened?
You daft prick!
I was called and I came.  What's up?
Well, yes.  Groovy.
Me?
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
What's going on?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Why not?
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
No -- you're right.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
And you get on very well.
And she's in your house.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
No, 'fraid not.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Try 'Flintstone.'
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Absolutely not.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
You want me to write down all your messages?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Hey.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Cool, huh?
Point taken.
Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
