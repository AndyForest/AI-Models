Lovely to meet you.
I'm a vegetarian.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
Hi.
Night, night, Honey.
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
That was such a great evening.
Well... a shot at it.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
And then I... right.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
I'm not listening.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Fifteen million dollars.
Films mainly.
Well, they can be.
I'm an actress.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I thought I'd give it to you.
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
Well... how have you been?
You disappeared.
Hi.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
But... wait... there are things to say.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
This is certainly... ah...
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
Excuse me?
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
How do you think I'm doing?
Jesus.
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
What?
Damn, I forgot the jam.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Oh.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
You and every person in this country.
What?
Okay.
Right.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Both.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Big feet -- large shoes.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
You've got big feet.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
You think I should do Henry James instead?
What do you think?
Well, get a message through to him too.
My son's name is Johnny?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
I have thought about you.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
A bath would be great.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
Hi.  Can I come in?
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
You've got to go.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
I don't know either.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
Why?
So who left who?
Step aside.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
Yes, you did.
What did you say?
You abide by rules like that?
Let's go in.
I was.
Busy tomorrow?
Too complicated.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Floppy, huh?
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
Okay.
If that's all right.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Okay -- fine.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Yes.
And what happens next in the dream?
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Hello.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Oh -- Okay.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Hi.
Bye.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Thanks.  Well...
I forgot my bag.
Thank you.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
No.
Really, no.
No.
No thanks.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Oh Jesus.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Really?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
I haven't decided.
Nice surprise.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Yes...
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
What's your name?
Yes.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Is that right?
