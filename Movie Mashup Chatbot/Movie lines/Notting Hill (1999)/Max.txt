No!
Now you're lying.
I'm delighted.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
And this is William.
Christ, what is going on in there?
Does the girl have a name?

Where's Bella?
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.

Bernie -- this is Anna.
Hello, Bernie.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
So not over her, in fact.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Any more announcements?
Is it someone we know?
That's not fair.
Well?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
I think you do, yes.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
Do you ever masturbate?
'No comment' means 'yes.'
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
