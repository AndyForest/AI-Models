You know who I am.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Sit down!
Sit down, Jake.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Oh?  Where you going?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
You can have anything you want.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Jake, what is it?
You look upset.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You've lived with me for two years.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Sit down.
Sit down, Jake.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Please.
Bullshit!
I can waitress. I'm good.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
It's so hard to believe.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
What's gotten into you?
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
How?
Who was that?
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
It might be for me.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
I want to know. You tell me!
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Who else were you expecting?
It's just me.
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
He said you didn't have one.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
While you were in the shower.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
How come? The army?
Remember that.
I know.
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Here. I'll do it.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Lie down!
What kind of man are you?
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
That's your decision.
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
He's coming right over.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Get your clothes off!
Get your clothes off.
The numbers stop at 107.
It's gone to the top.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
Can't you stop it?
Hey, I'm here.
Why? What for?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
We're at Della's.
Oh, come on. It's early.
You okay?
Come on. What were they, Jake?
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
I enjoy crushing into you.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
What's wrong?
Jake!
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
I don't like things that make you cry.
Is that the one who died?
Not to me.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Why you left.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Lemme see.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
The best.
A good lay.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
I don't let anybody call me that.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
They're weird names.
No. The little one.
Your kid dropped it off.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Did you look around the headboard?
Where'd you leave 'em?
You up?
What happened to you?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
The room!
What do you think?
That help?
I moved the couch. That's all.
Where are you?
Gee, thanks a lot.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
Jake, is that you?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Pour it in.
He doesn't like it.
Bring it in.
