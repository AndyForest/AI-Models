What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
Oh God. I know. I know.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
You've seen them?
What do you mean?
I don't know what to do.
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I just need to talk.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Still married, Jake?
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Count 'em on one hand.
I work in a bakery.
I need to see you.
I need to see you, Jake.
Nothin' much.
A long time.
Paul Gruneger!
Jacob Singer?
