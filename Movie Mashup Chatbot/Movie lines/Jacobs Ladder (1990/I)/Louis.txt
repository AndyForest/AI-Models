Jake, you need to rest.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
What are you doing?
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
I know.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
What?
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
Wiggle your toes.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
You should go back to her.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
Not much. She's like you that way. Two clams. No wonder your marriage didn't last. Put your hand under your head. Take a breath and then let it out.
Who?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
A bit.
I saw Sarah the other day.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
