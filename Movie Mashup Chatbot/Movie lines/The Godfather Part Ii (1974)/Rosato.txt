That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
What about Michael Corleone?
We got friends in the commission.
We got no choice.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
The same assurance we got from you.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We worked it all out beforehand.
Sitting right behind you.
