Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
Not good.
I just left our friend in Miami.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
