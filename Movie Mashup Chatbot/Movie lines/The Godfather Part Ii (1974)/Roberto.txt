I won't keep you another minute...
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
