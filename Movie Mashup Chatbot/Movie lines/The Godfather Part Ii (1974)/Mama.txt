Connie.
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
Bought at the airport.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
Yes, thank you.
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
