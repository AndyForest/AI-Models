Thanks...friend.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
No strings.
What the hell are you talking about?
...and the tape will be running.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross...
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
Some water.
I thought we would meet alone.
