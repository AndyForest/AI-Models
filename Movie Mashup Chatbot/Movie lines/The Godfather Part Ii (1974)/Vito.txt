Who is the greatest man you can think of?
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
We have no money for a rug.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
You must understand, this is all new to me...
My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
Chi?
And he agreed?
Why?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
What?
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Beautiful.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
He's an Italian?
I accept your generosity...
What was that?
Yes.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
How much more a month?
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
