The committee is adjourned until further notice.
This meeting is adjourned.
The witness is excused; take him out.
Is he related to the witness?
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Very well.
I don't think that's necessary.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
