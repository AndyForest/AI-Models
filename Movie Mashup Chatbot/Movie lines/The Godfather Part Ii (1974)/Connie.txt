Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
I got surprises for everybody!
How are the kids?
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Is Kay coming?
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
Because I need MONEY!
You're not my father!
Michael...
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
