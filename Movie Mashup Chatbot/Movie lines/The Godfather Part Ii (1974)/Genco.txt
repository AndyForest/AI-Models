Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
The 'patrone' is here.
He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
I bet you can't guess what happened?
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
Beautiful.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
A pig of a Neaponitan.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
