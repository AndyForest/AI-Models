She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Really?
I'm Adam Webber.
Thank-Q!
You like it?
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
Hi!
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
Yes, ma'am.
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
For how long?
Come where?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
How do you do?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Please excuse this interruption.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
How do you do?
My mother's like that.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
Hi, Eve!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
It was at least as good as the sky.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Yes, Eve?
No.
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Thanks.
I know first aid!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
What?
I know...and I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry!
Eve?!
But, Eve, I would--
Eve, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
You wanted to see me!
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
That's ridiculous.
Really?
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Okay. I like that.
How 'bout this one?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
What about her?
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
I like her.
I thought I was here to meet women.
Good-bye!
Do I look crazy?
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
No it's not!
I certainly do!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Hey, Eve!
Okay!
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
About clothing?
The guy with the underpants!
The what?
All right.
May I please be excused?
In the house?
He has a computer?
Where's he gone?
Good for you.
Wow.
Yes!
Um-hum.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Thank-Q!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
I like it.
Is this your house?
You said it would be easy!
I told you I've never driven before!
Sorry!
Yes, ma'am!
The engine is still running.
Of course.
That's what I was afraid of.
Two weeks.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
One who's not a mutant.
It didn't used to be that way.
They're all divorced?
I didn't know that.
It does?
Bites what?
I don't want to be alone.
Because I want to get married.
Yes.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
This is for me.
Then forget it.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Okay.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
I guess we'll need another locker.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Sorry.
Wait! Wait!
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
My Mom and Dad.
They like Dr. Pepper.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
What's fair?
Two weeks.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Why not go to work for me?
...Okay.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Why doesn't it never work out?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Watching television in color.
I think it's the eyes.
Thank-Q!
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I haven't brushed yet.
Okay.
I can't, it's yours.
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
Right.
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Oh, I could die...
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
It's Perry!
Wait!  Wait!
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Heck, no!  What?!
Yes.
Yes.
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Nope.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Do you own a car?
It was amazing.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Again.
Right.
So far?
Oh, that's nice.
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
I came on a bus.
I just had a mental picture of...
Dickhead?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
No, I'm lost.
Where are we going?
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Get out of here!
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Of course!
A card?
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Nothing.
Is this because of the radiation?
Gee-ma-nee!
Is that a birthday cake?!
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
I promise.
How do I leave here?
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
I've got to go, now.
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Are you all right?
Uh, I think they have.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Yes, sir. It's true.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
I'll try.
I promise. Is that all?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
Yes, father?! Yes?
Merci!
Shit is a French word?
Well, do we just go on up?!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
No kidding!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Then why go there?
Why?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Like one of Mom's?
Like a painting?
What's baseball?
These are wonderful.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Gerade aus dann links!
Tempus fugit!
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
And thanks for always being happy!
Bye, Troy!
Goodbye.
Does that work?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
What?
You bet!
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Oh. I see.
Why did you park way back there?
I LOVE THIS!!
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
The recovery is very impressive.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
No.
I just don't want to.
I'm not wearing his pants.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Yes. He likes windows.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
That would knock my father out.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
No.
I don't think so.
It's so small.
This must be very new.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Juneau.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Russia.
1959.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Right on the button.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
I love Lucy!
Not particularly.
You have very nice ceilings.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
How old do I look?
Thirty-five.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
My father is a genius.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
Of what?
Just look!!
Up there!!
The sky!!!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Good!
How do you do, ma'am.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Hello.
Yes.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
We have to go.
I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Mom?
Right.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll be all right.
I'll go up.
Dad!
Sorry, Mom!
Yes, ma'am.
