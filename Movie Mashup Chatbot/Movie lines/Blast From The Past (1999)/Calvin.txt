Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
Uh-huh.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
That's what everybody believes?
You're sure?
Uh-huh.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Well, in that case...of course, son.
But, I don't understand.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
...the pipe tobacco.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Blow out the candles!
Because he must!
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
No. Sit down.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
No, son. A pitcher.
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulï¿½!
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Really?
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Some time.
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
I thought ten years.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
He's smart.
--do as I say!
--and we will--
Well, I am the head of this household--
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Yes.
We stay down here.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
Yes.
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Should we say a little prayer first?
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
In the generator room again?
Sure.
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
If we still have one.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Well, we did in my family!
If he tells, it won't come true!
And I made these!
You bet.
Coming!
Hi, honey!
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
What?
Yes.  Well... yes.
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Right here!
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Yes!
No.  I think it's just right.
I've noticed.
Is there a problem?
Honey?
What?
I told you! I've got everything!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
How could you?! This is just like home!
Really?
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
To go up.
Then after that it's safe.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
The locks.
Home sweet home!
Yes, dear!
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
You hear that?!
No.  They all do.
It shuts off automatically.
It's time.
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
You bet, hon!
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
