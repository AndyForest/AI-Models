We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
No.
...I do.
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Neat. Goodnight!
Really?  Okay!
My pleasure.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Uh-huh. Adam?
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
Sing it to me.
Is that what you call it?
There.
Well, you had better!!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Goodnight!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
I'm leaving, too.
I don't blame you!
Adam?!
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Did you?
What?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
No way.
What have you ordered?
And don't be so obvious!
Not that one!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
Yes!
No!  Not crazy!
Look unimpressed.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Yeah.
That's boring!
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
So, what are you seeing?
Uh...yeah.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Sure.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
What?!
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Yes!
I was wrong!!
Never drive again!
You almost got us killed!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Now, get out!!
Get out!
Thank you.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
When do you need her by?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Everybody's divorced.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Sure.
The big one!
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Why?!
What for?
A wife?
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Name it.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Thank you.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Night!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
What?
Very funny, smart ass.
Who are these people?
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Sure.
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
What's the pay?
How long would you need me?
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Doing what?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
What?
See, ya.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
No.
Okay!  Damn!
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Why are you doing that?
Take it. damn it!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
I know a short-cut.
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
Over this?
How's that?
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Perry?
What is it?!
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
And that's it?
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Get away from me!!
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
You don't?
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Yes, I'm right?
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Here, pick these up!
What's wrong with you?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
You're lost?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, you get out of here.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Are you French?
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
Oh, my God!
Stop it, you two!
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
You came back for these?
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
What are you doing here?
Stop!
Adam!!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Come on.
What?!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Then what?
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Have him committed.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
We'll find him.
Give it back to him.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
Gay.
Oh, no!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Coward!
You're goddamn right I am!
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
What?!!
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Where did he get all that information?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
What?
Or have perfect table manners.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
To bed?
Where are you going?
Those sluts!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Who did he leave with?
What's that mean?
He go back to the hotel?
Go to the bathroom.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Just be yourself.
That water's freezing!
No.
I think...it...works.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Well, that's blunt!
What's that supposed to mean?
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Give me your hand.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
I knew you'd like him.
