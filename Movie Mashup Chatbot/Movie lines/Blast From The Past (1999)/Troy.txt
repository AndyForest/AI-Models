What?
Bye, Adam!
Good-bye, Adam.
Yeah...Seems to.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
So, did you buy a movie?
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
What?!
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Almost all of them.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
Okay.
Why not? He has great pants.
Not on him.
True.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yeah?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
Yeah.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
What's the capitol?
When did we get it from them?
Who use to own it?
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
She's right?!
That's right?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Really?  Since when?
And it's called...?
You nut!
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Where?!
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
We came back to the house!
To get some frozen poultry.
I don't know. I like to think so.
Yeah! That's thinking.
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
What's wrong?
And if we can't find him?
What do you want to do with it?
Fallout shelter.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
What?!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
I don't think so.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
He left with Sophie.
He didn't leave with them.
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Yes, you do!
Uh, yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
To bed.
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
What's it to you?!
We did not leave together.
Uh..he might of.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Um... Eve?
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Eve?!
Always good advice.
He's from Alaska.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
Well, what do you think?
What do you think, Adam?
Alright, I will.
That's what I'm sensing.
I see "elegant."
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
You're serious, aren't you?
I don't know.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
Oh, my God...
Oh, yes.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
