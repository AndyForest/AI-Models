No.
Well, where are you --
This is your bedroom?
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
What?
A psychiatrist?!
Are you in trouble, son?!
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Yes?
I just hope this is still good up there.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
You're my brave boy.
I'm afraid you've got to.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Elbows, Son.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
What can I offer you, Eve?
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
How long will you set it for this time?
Amen.
Yes, dear, I know.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
I want him to at least see the sky!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
Excuse me.
We do?
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
I don't believe it!
No.
Mutants?!
Yes! That's right!
Yes, yes it is!
Just open the door.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Would you excuse me?
Yes...
Let's eat our cake.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
What did you wish for, Adam?
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
Get the presents and do the lights.
Calvin!
Hi.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Watch this!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Why?
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Calvin?!
If I...you know...
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
What shall we call him?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Oh, no.
You have tranquilizers?
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
I'm not hungry.
All our friends...
No.
To go up.
It's safe.
Thirty -five years!
The locks?
What's that noise?
To you maybe.
As long as we've got that straight.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Days??
How long will we have to stay down here?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Yes.
I never know anymore.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Well, put it down and come in!
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
