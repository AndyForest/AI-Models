Eve? I'm leaving.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Do ya?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
What?!
Oh, brother...
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
I forgot some of my stuff.
What are you bitching about now?
