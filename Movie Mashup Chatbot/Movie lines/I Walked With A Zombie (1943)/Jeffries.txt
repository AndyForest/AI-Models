That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Why?
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
