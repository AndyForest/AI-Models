Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
That's nonsense, Alma.
Where?
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
What's this?
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
Thank you, Alma.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
Thank you for waking me.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
You mean a figurehead.
Alive?
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
Mrs. Rand...
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
But you didn't have to come up here.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
But, Mrs. Rand --
Mrs. Rand.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
You don't believe in it?
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
I'd love to.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
I'm afraid so.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Thank you.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
She can never be cured?
Does she suffer?
But it's so far away...
The West Indies?
That will mean another interview, won't it?
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
Yes.
No, Wes.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
But she's not dead, Wes.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
Of course, Wes.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
That doesn't sound like him.
I wish I hadn't heard --
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
Wait. I want to listen.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
But don't you have to work?
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
It's my day off.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Mr. Holland?
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
-- But, you're an American?
Thank you.  But who sits there?
I like her already.
Is she a doctor?
Yes -- on the boat.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
You want that?
That's past -- that's over and done with...
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
You wanted to warn me...
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
She was beautiful.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I told you.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I wanted to help you.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
I imagined this so differently...
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
You didn't drive her mad.
I love Fort Holland.
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I heard you playing.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Good morning.
I've never given it much thought.
I suppose so.  Yes.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
I'm sorry...
Of course not!
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
I am not a frightened girl.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Why was the maid crying?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
Can't I take it for you?
Yes, thank you.
You can't really believe that.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
