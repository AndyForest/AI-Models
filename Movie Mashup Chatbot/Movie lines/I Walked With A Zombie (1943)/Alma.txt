Yes, Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
At the Houmfort.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
Good morning, miss.
