That's rather nice, isn't it?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.

Where were you trained?
You're single?
