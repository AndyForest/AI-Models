What are you doing?
That's nice.
I'll get us out of here.
Awwww...
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
You're lovely.
Yeah, sure.
They can?
Oh no!
You've changed your mind.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
She works for them.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
I have been... I think you're right.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
Looks like you can have all you want.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Where've you been?
What happened?
I don't know.
Do something.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
There's a lot you don't know.
Dieter!
He aready made the deal..
Holy...
Aim what?
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
I can't handle that thing.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
And Dieter?
Where?
He hung us up dry.
Well...?
haka xuki. What's that mean?
What was it? What'd I say?
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
You sure this will work?
I was afraid of that.
Come on.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Probably.
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
You were with GRUNER!
nan
What?
I can't see a thing.
Ow!
What are you doing?
...imagine a better grape for the region.
I can't...
What next!
Too late.
Don't worry!
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
I told you, I have a feeling...
You think. That's what you're good at.
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
What do I do?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
Where are you going?
Sapporo..
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
I can't keep up.
On what?
What do I do?
I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
Don't you think I stand out like this.
Osaka?
That's good. It's not better. Where?
You found her.
Why don't you get out of my face.
It wasn't like that.
No. What will you do.
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
It's not your time. I get time off.
She's got the most beautiful...s
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
I don't know!
I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.
You shut down your sensors.
You got any books in there?
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
It's embarrassing.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
Not her. You!
This just won't work.
Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Even Rene?
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
How do you know?
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
I don't know what's going on.
Killer!
Which one?
I feel like an idiot.
Are you serious?
What glasses.
That's a big if.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
Who, me?
That place. By the window.
You have no taste.
The beautiful one.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Why not?!
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Mind your own business.
Not blue enough.
This...is not going to work out.
What is it?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Now, where would I be?
Yeah. I did it.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Rene...
I made it work.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
To the hotel. To register.
...Rene...
...Joe.
What?
Where are you staying?
Wait.
.
What?
What do I do?
Help me out, will you?
Which language?
She doesn't seem to understand.
You're beautiful..
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
She's...pretty fast.
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
A girl.
Beautiful!
Are you screwing with any nerves?
Al, are you doing anything in there?
Where are you going? Wait!
It's sand.
I don't want to eat it.
Eat it?
Now what?
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Little late for that.
Good Idea!
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
...Just beautiful.
Holy shit!
Eating sushi?
The beach?
Now what?
You leave my glands alone!
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Oh yeah, to what?
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
It's just not enough.
They'll know who I am.
...and a license to kill...
I'll get in trouble.
It's illegal.
I can't do that.
I don't have any.
What about money?
We get on which plane?
You mean...just leave.
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
What do we do?
What is it?
What am I supposed to do?
Who is it?
I'm at the airport.
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
Just scratched my arm, why?
Nothing!
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
You need ID in there?
Gone where?
That's not a good idea.
Black suits and helmets.
Like the guys that attacked us.
I can't remember..
The man.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
A lab and equipment.
Where are we going?
Corridor A.
Which way do I go?
Just walk down the hall?
Now what.
Door's locked.
I don't like the sound of that.
I'll sue.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
Find You?
I'm not leaving until you do.
Thanks.
I did. I brought you back here.
What do you mean we.
You are CRAZY!
Yeah...Who is?
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
They could put you back in the tube..
JOE Or what?
Why?
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
I don't know...To get Al.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
Why? AL  You know too much.
I want out.
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
I wouldn't say that.
Now what?
This is a Fiesta!
What do I do?
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Oh...Gooood!
Why not?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Who was that? Somebody out there?
With a man in my head...
Why he's argumentative?
You're gonna explain.
Then I'm crazy.
Hear voices don't I.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Yep.
Kill myself.
Loading a gun.
You said it.
I just went there for a job.
No.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Me? What'd I do?
Are you threatening me?
That a new Datsun?
What are you doing in my head, Al?
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
Who am I?
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
My place, can't you see?
Somebody's been here.
Shut up!
Do me a favor, Al.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
I see...
Your name is Al...
You're in my head...
This candid camera?
Al.
Who?
Who was it?
Arrrgh!
Why not.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Try me.
Where are you,...Al?
Al ???!!!
Who's you?
I know you did!
How about a deal?
Newer, more powerful design.
PEM115!
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
Then how did you know?
I think I've heard of you.
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
...Foreign service.
It is to me too.
Al Viola.
I don't want to intrude.
You...him...UST.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Not...complaining, actually.
Ahhh...nothing.
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
The little man in my...  ...head...
I don't know Who.
Not you. Them.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Oh yeah, thanks...
What?
I will?
I feel fine.
Oh....Sure.
Oh.
Here?
Well what?
Thanks.
How do I look?
Who...are you?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Remember what?
Do what?
Oh...that's okay.
What things?
Oh.
What about it?
What?
Whatever it is, don't do it.
Don't do it!
Thanks, I appreciate that.
A little voice in my head.
Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
The fresh tuna?..
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
Now you know what I know.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
Oh...and who is it!?
Then who did?
What?
What did you say?
What do you want?
Yes...What is it?
Yeah...I have to get away.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
Riuji?
Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
Come on.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
He told me what to do.
It wasn't me. It was him.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
He can't help us.
We just don't stop.
I knew it. I told him.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Her?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
I'll come back for you.
Escape.
Don't worry.
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
Now what?
What?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
Why did you, then?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Nothing we can do.
What a mess.
Why?
Now what?
What did you tell them?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Are you alright?
I can't fly it.
Sure I can, can't I?
Why not?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
So do I.
You coming along?
You've  been there?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.
Why'd you ask him.
Oh.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
What?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Where would you go to sell a chip?
Get us one.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
We figure out if it's in here.
He plays it all the time.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Beats me.
And you?
And Dieter.
Who was?
What's Gruner like?
You think I'm like that?
Then why are you smiling like that?
You don't believe me.
Get your things.
What is it?
Got to trust someone.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
We're very close.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
You know where he went?
I'm just on vacation.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Why?
Food doesn't agree with me.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Who did?
He didn't.
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
Were you working for him last night?
You work for Ryuji?
Why did they leave?
What did you tell them?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
Who else is interested in me?
Why?
Why did you stay with me?
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you leave?
Why'd you run off?
And you, what do you like?
How often they come here?
Hires you for what?
Is that Ryuji?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
...Naw. Made that up.
Just Okay...
And how'm I doing?
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
Promise you what?
You are.
I am sort of scattered.
Disinterest?
It's not apparent.
Why?
Me still. They left you alone?
And you?
Yes, of course.
Wait. What's your name?
What way?
What's so funny?
Let you leave without it.
I can't do that?
...right here too.
Dinner...tonight.
I'll be right there.
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
The poet...something he said...
...Blake
No. No one to speak of.
...I'm looking for someone.
What about the others.
Why'd you invite me here?
Why are you on to him?
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
...Piece of mind.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Thanks.
A drink...
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
