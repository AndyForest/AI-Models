Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
You're a lucky man.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
She is beautiful.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Now, you're too suspicious.
Rene?
About what?
Keep thinking.
Gimme a minute.
Never mind that, where are we now.
Be quiet.
Losing power. The laser drained it.
What exactly?
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
This may hurt.
And don't let her know, either.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
...Shit! It's just money.
Aim just in front of his face.
Are you alright?
Don't worry, I can.
Do it.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
While he makes the run.
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
Left...The one with the red dot.
Cash.
haka xuki.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
Not sure at all.
I've got an idea.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
It's him.
I don't trust her.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
No. You can't trust her.
He was with Gruner!
Never mind, just say it.
Neither can they.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
A hard left. A hard left.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
You have to! Quickly!
Drink lots of water.
...drink it.
Don't touch a thing.
One of your instincts?
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
Relax. Let me do this.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Just stay here and rest.
That's not funny.
Come on, she's getting away.
Run, stupid!
Follow her.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Osaka.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Bingo.
Some agent you are.
You been had. We have.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
You get time off to sleep.
And on my time.
Shit! You're in love.
Is that all?
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
What Happened?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
Oh come on.
What am I supposed to do?
What if she says something important?
What is it?
You're doing great with her.
What is it, your charm?
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
She's the toughest to read.
Voice stress analyzer.
They're all in it.
Joe, be careful!
Don't get too cute.
He recognises you, throw him off.
It lends you an air of mystery.
Just don't show fear.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Just hold them close and stay still.
Follow that busboy.
The drinks...Stay on them.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Get close to them.
They both look good to me.
Which one is she?
Doesn't.
What did that cost?
Not that tie with that coat.
It is my business. It's my name.
Much too blue.
You really like that shirt?
Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
Is something glinting?
But what's it look like?
What are you looking at?
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
Well you did it today.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
It worked.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
Without your pants.
Where are you going?
What happened?
No...you idiot!
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
Touch her.
Where is she staying?
Wait.
.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
Don't just stand there, say something.
What can I do? You're on your own.
How should I know?
Try another language.
What's happening?
What is it?
You're out of shape.
Follow it.
What was?
What? What do you mean?
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Why not?
Eat it.
The sand.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
You eat it.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Swim.
Do you notice anything.
What is it?
Just get there.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
The beach.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
You'll be me.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
We'll change your appearance.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
Who cares?
Why not?
Use my credit cards.
What about it?
We get on a plane.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Nothing. You just do nothing.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Good. Get to a phone.
I'm back.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Don't know.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
What do you mean?
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
Who did?
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Take a left and your next right.
What does it say.
With Authority!
Go out, take your first left.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
We have to get out of here.
Sue them.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
You gotta help.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
I am. You are.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
It can't take that long.
Did you hear that?
No. Don't tell the guards.
Calm Down! Act rational.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
Too late...They want you.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Then what are you stopping for?
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Outrun them.
What'd he look like?
What's that?
Behind us?
Anyone there?
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
I'll tell you what to say.
I'll talk to them.
No they won't.
Why don't you?
You weren't listening!
What was that?
Yeah.
You'll be alive.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Yeah.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Of course you do!
You're not crazy.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Are you crazy?
What for?
What are you doing?
I know...it sounds insane.
Then how'd I get here?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
You've heard of the PEM114...
I told you, my name is Al.
Quit screwing around, this is important.
Yeah...Who?
Who are you?
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Right.
No.
Where are we now?
Yeah?
...I need to make a phone call.
Why don't we go home?
What street?
Where are we?
I just got here.
What is your name?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes?
Al.
Me.
It wasn't him.
Don't do that.
What's going on?
I'm...inside you.
You're not gonna believe this...
My name is AL.
No, not her. Me.
I said something.
You just got a Mickey.
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
It's all we've got.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
I knew you were trouble.
Then what?
What kind of a deal?
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
Don't worry.
I'm against it.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
Good.
No!
Don't give her your name.
Do what? What'd you do?
The best part. She'll love it.
Doesn't matter.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Sorry...
Not that truth!
