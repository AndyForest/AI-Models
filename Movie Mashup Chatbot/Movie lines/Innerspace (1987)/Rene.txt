Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Let us get to the border!
Nice?
I didn't do anything.
I'm...scared.
Can you fly this?
I insist.
Dieter?
Oh, I can't.
What is your name?
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
What part what?
It'll remind me of you.
Aren't we all.
What a nerve!
ya hyutn slulptsa?
In him?
What happened?
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
He's not an ordinary man.
It's just money.
Yes. Joe.
I have a new client.
We met on the beach.
I know a nice island.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
He wants to apologise.
What is it?
I told you, I work for him.
That's twenty feet high.
If he was able, what would he say.
But you did it. It was you.
It was you.
You are, I've seen you.
Do something!
Now what?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
Kiss her you fool.
You're gonna laugh.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
Just like that?
Why not, what are you going to do?
I love you too.
I've never met anyone like you.
How?
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
For you.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
It was my choice.
Can't you do something?
What?
You can say that again. What do we do?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
That I really don't know.
They asked about you.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What'd...you forget?
What happened?
Can you?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
This going to work?
I know the territory.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Chiang Cho?
What?
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
I asked him.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
Hong Kong.
Where what?
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
That must be him. Water taxi.
How?
Now what?
What?
Then where's the chip.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Where we going?
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Ryuji and Gruner.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Oh sure.
Hiroshima.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
How do you know you can trust me?
One chip?
What'd he steal?
He must be a good friend.
What's he done?
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
This business is over.
I'm leaving too.
You're leaving.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You did.
No.
No, he didn't do that.
Last night?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
There's not much to tell.
They kidded me a little.
What do you mean?
You seemed interesting.
Wanted to get to know you.
They left. I had to go with them.
Joe! What happened to you?
That depends...
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Trans Ocean Travel.
Who do you work for?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
You're doing...Okay.
You're talking to me.
You did.
Why do you do it?
You talk to yourself.
That you're not crazy.
Are you alright?
Can I help?
As if your mind's not all there.
...and sort of...disinterest.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
...I...don't know.
I waited for you.
You again.
I just work for the travel firm.
You mean from it.
...Rene.
Like there's someone else here.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Without what?
Do what?
Haven't seen you around.
And you.
Oh...I can't. Business.
Where?
Blake said that?
Yes?
Blake?
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
Is someone else here?
What do you do about what?
