I don't know.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Excuse me?
What could you find in this place?
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
