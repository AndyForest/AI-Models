Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hello, again.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
What's the matter with my place?
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
You're in a hurry.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
I'm candy...
