No, don't!
I feel nauseous.
You two better quit it.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
Awww. That was so cute.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
I'll try to manage.
Such a sordid state of affair.
You're kidding.
Why aren't there any lights?
Can I use the bathroom?
God, isn't he great?
So where is he?
Dick.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
You can hold me down.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
She said not to come home until graduation.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
Oh God...
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Stop this. This isn't funny.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
How'd you get here so fast?
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
You're such an asshole.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
He's not invited.
Sang.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You mean, on a date?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
You work in a market, all right.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
Look how full of yourself you are.
You don't have anything to do with it.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
I just told you.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
I'm giving him his ring back.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
I love a macho faï¿½ade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Was I right?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
No.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Well... kind of, sort of?
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I'm not pregnant.
It's not what you think.
You saw it?
You're just going to lock the store like that?
Train. It took eight hours.
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Just now.
