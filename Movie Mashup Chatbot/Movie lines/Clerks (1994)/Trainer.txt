Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
To you?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
How much can you bench?
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
I like the way you think.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
Really?
Yeah!
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
Because he's out of shape.
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
Feel that.
I do about three-fifty, four.
I think the lady called it.
He is.
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
