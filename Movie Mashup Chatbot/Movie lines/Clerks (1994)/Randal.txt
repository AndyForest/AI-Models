Why?
Nobody! I swear!
I was here the whole time.
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
He was?
Am I missing something here?
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
There's no light back there.
No, this is great.
He went home to change for the big date.
Exactly.
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Can I join in?
Can I watch?
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
I take it she likes the guy.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
Yeah.
Peptic ulcer.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
What's your point?
Annoying Customer.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Lenin's Tomb.
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Helluva day.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Same time. What about you?
Got one. Just pulled up.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  "I'm not even supposed to be here today."  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
It's not like I'm miles away.
To talk to you.
Like ten after.
How do you figure?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Why do you say that?
You still didn't have to choke me.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
You didn't have to choke me.
It's hard to swallow.
How's your eye?
Lovely story.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Make them change.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Am I right or what?
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
It's the same thing with Veronica.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
You should shit or get off the pot.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
Thirty-seven.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
This life?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
I think four.
Around three or something.
She said she did all the work.
You just fucked a total stranger?
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
Fuck you.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
You're a snake.
Hey, what about Veronica?
What happened to title dictates behavior?
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
You're kidding.
What did she say?
Now I know you're lying.
You're happy to get a fine?
You're happy?
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're lying.
Then how come you got the fine?
Holy shit. That girl?
Really?
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
You're bullshitting.
No way!
I like to expand my horizons.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
Get to work.
I know I'm your hero.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
Not yet.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
If you must.
Let me borrow your car.
What's that for?
I want to rent a movie.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Let me borrow your car.
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
Listen to you.
I never tried it.
What, your dick?
Reach what?
Yeah, but at what a price.
Balls resting on his lips.
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
I swear.
Bible truth.
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
Broke his neck.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
An embolism in a pool.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
You were saying?
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
I'm going with you.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
If you go, I go.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
It's today.
No, you're not.
You've had sex with a dead person.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
No, I'm serious.
Julie Dwyer died.
You know what Sanford told me?
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Helluva game!
Then where're we gonna play?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Are you gonna lock the store?
Design major.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
At least we're stuck here together.
See? There you go again.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Because you buckled.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
Why'd you apologize?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Vermont?
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Thirty-seven!
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Why not?
All of them.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
The milkmaids?
Let's hear it.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
What did he say?
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
The quest isn't going well?
Perfect dozen.
What's he looking for?
She's in here?
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
So they build another Death Star, right?
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
All right, Vader's boss...
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
Blasphemy.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Return of the Jedi.
You know what I just watched?
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc�.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
What about Veronica?
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
You think things would be any different now?
Oh yeah.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
That's frightening.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Your mother.
That girl was vile to you.
Oh, my God.
What do you mean?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
She called you Brad?
That's cheating?
Eight and a half?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
What do you two fight about?
Did you tell Veronica?
You called Caitlin again?
I wanted to use your car.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
What smells like shoe polish?
What time do you have to stay till?
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Why are the shutters closed?
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
You'll be missed.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
I hope it feels good.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
No, I wasn't.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
He didn't ask me to...
You're not?
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
Twenty bucks.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Says who?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Which one?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
