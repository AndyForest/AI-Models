Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
Yeah, but not in here.
That's it, everybody out.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
I think you'd better leave now.
Hey, now wait a sec...
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Fifty-five.
Excuse me, but...
Beats me.
Sure. Go ahead.
Thanks. Have a good one.
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Call the police.
Are you sure somebody was back there?
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
No.
I'm serious.
Was it you?
It wasn't me.
Um... okay.
Like what?
I left like an hour ago.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Who doesn't?
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
I'm just kidding.
So what are you saying?
He's your fiancï¿½.
Sang.
What about Sing?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
You have a better suggestion?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
Let me take you out tonight.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
But can we date?
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Jesus, you're caustic.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
You lie.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
There's more, isn't there?
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Sang? His name is a past tense?
What?
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
But you were.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
How like her.
No, you're not really getting married?
So you're really getting married?
How do you know that?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
And you said yes?
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
Very dramatic, I thought.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
I can't believe you're here.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
My God. I haven't seen you since...
When did you get back?
She thought it was me.
What about Caitlin?
Well he asked me for it!
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
Nobody. It was closed.
We did.
Just me.
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
So I'm told.
To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
Yes.
That's easy to say from over here.
Like you're better!
Who are you to make assessments?
I can pass!
In a second!
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Excuse me?
Yeah.
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
You only brought one ball?!
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
Get the fuck outta here already.
To say the least.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
I'll call you. Let you know.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
Do you work tomorrow?
You need a ride?
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
What time did you get to work today?
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Jesus.
Thanks.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Leave me alone.
Leave her out of this.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Oh, like your life's any better?
Leave me alone.
As if it's that easy.
What responsibility?
Fuck you.
What are you talking about?
I should shit or get off the pot.
I was born.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Why do I have this life?
This life.
What time did we go to the funeral?
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Shut the fuck up!
Could be.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
There's no lights back there.
Who eats cock?
I'll read the book.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I'm not.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
I'm not. She just left.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
I'm happy.
Because I'm happy.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm here.
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
I don't; you did.
Living proof.
Five hundred dollars.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
And this is what you rented?
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Please, get the hell out of here.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
What?
Jesus!
What the fuck did you do that for?
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
Exactly.
What?
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
May I be blunt with you?
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
You work in a video store!
You want to rent a movie.
Why should I loan you my car?
I don't want to talk to you.
Just... go! Go open the video store.
Her fucking body fell out!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I can't fucking believe you!!
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
You know.
I could never reach.
He made it, hunhh?
His dick was in his mouth?
Who found him?
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
No!
Oh, my god.
Stop it.
Shut the hell up.
That's embarrassing?
How'd he die?
An embarrassing way to die.
Twenty-two; same as us.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
I can't close the store.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
She meant nothing to you!
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
You hate people.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
You hardly knew her!
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
What!?
Why not?
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Number six.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Jesus.
How? When?
Oh, my god.
Yeah, right.
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Exactly. They drank it all.
Gatorade.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
We're not playing in the street.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Can we not talk about this?
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Pull my laces tighter.
You've got a customer.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
Sorry.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
I'm going to miss the game.
You know what pisses me off the most?
I don't back down.
I know.
What?
FUCK!
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
Can you believe this?!
The best Burtless movie ever made.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Veronica!
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
No.
Which ones?
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
The milkmaids.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
There aren't.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
Can we talk about this later?
What kind of show?
I guess not.
Nudie booth?
What's a jizz-mopper?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
Each egg has to be perfect.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
Wait.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
So?
And the second time around...?
Basically.
And you figured it out?
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Yeah.
There's more?
I think they were Catholics.
More or less.
It would stand to reason, yes.
Yeah.
I guess.
How do you mean?
The Emperor.
What's that?
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
Empire.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
All four?
I think it's safe to say yes.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
I'm talking to myself here.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
Allan Harris.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Great story, isn't it?
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
She called me Brad.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
Eight and a half.
Five years.
Seven months.
You win.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
She called me.
You don't want to know.
Why?
No, thanks.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Shocking abuse of authority.
Go open the sore.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
That's what I said.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
You're late.
Jesus Christ, what next?
THE GLADES MOTEL?
You know him?
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
Do I know you?
I don't have love handles.
I know I can bench more than that!
Thirty-fire.
Yes.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
I... I don't believe this...
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
What?
No, she's getting married.
How do you know that?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh for God's sake!
I don't know.
I am not.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
They are not.
I don't think so.
I didn't strain. I sighed.
Excuse me?
Meaning?
She's my girlfriend.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
Maybe.
Lasagne.
Veronica.
We were going to start again, I think.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
He died in the bathroom.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
So.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
It's not my store.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
Nothing personal.
With you? I don't think so.
I should start.
A half hour.
One seventy-nine.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Go open the video store.
Are there any balls down there?!
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Actually, that's his night job.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
Here. Now leave me alone.
The porno mags?
I said go ahead.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
Jesus... go ahead.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Yeah, but...
Actually, it is kind of rough.
The white kind.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Oh... Can I help you?
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
So I'm told.
I'm trying.
Veronica, I love you...
Randal...?
I don't want to go back with her...
I don't want Caitlin...
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
Would you let me explain...
A couple...?
It was only a few times...
What're you talking about?
What the fuck did you do that for?
Sure.
What time do you get finished?
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
Thank you for the lasagne.
...it isn't there. Yes.
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
Really?  You're the best.
What is it?
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
I feel sick.
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
A few?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Hey! Where are you going?!
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Well...?
This is different. This is important. How many?!
HOW MANY?
How many dicks have you sucked?!
How many?
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
You sucked his dick!
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
You sucked that guy's dick?
Yeah, right.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
He requested this?
What do you mean?
Why do you call him that?
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Where?
All right. Name it.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
No; who were the three, besides me?
Who?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Three?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Why'd you hit me?
What the hell was that for?
Including you; yes.
Twelve.
Including you?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
How many what?
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
I touched a nerve.
Something wrong?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
How do you figure?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Really?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Why do you say that?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
What? What is that?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Hunhh? Nothing.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
I hate this fucking place.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
I think it's coming now...
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I didn't do that!
What are you talking about?
WHAT?
What's this?
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
I'm not out of shape!
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
What?
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
