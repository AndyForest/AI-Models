Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
No, he got hit by a bus.
I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Be careful.
