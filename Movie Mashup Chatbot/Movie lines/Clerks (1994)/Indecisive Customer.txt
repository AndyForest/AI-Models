Screw you!
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
You hope what feels good?
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
I beg your pardon!
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
Well, how about these two movies?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
