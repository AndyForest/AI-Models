I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
You used to go out with her?
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
What's that mean?
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
I'm not dealing.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing...
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
Check this out, he's from Russia.
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
I'll see you there.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
That's the price, my brother.
