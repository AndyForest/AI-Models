Don't worry -- it comes off today.
Name me a better photographer.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Yeah.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Jeff --
Something wrong?
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Hello.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Like what?
I'll send you some comic books.
Read some good books.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
With that cast on -- you don't.
You did.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Wrong day?
This is Wednesday.
For getting rid of that cast.
Congratulations, Jeff.
