Where's the office?
They've been in there all day.
Not until the man calls.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.

I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
What's my name?
Don't worry about what we used to be.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.

Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
