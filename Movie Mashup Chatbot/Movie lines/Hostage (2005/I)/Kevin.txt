I'm not going to die for this!
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
It's over.  We have to give up.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
What are you talking about?
Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
There is no way out.
We're fucked.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
Like what?
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Jesus.  What is this?
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
It's about Mars --
I have to tell you something --
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
That woman's gonna call the cops.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Whatever.
Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
You gotta pee?
Mars?  What are you doing?
