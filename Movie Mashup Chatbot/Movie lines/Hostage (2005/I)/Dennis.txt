<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Bullshit!
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Then we might as well die rich.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
Not if they're looking at something else.
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Okay.
We been through that.  Forget it.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
That you, Talley?
You're a funny guy, Talley.
What?
I'll give you these people.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
Talley?
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
How about the cop?
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
They're fine.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
We're cool.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
You with the cops?
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Use more ice.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
Who else is here?
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
Fuckin' A.
You got something to say?
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
What the fuck is that?
We don't have time!
The cops are comin'!
Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
We can take it with us.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
