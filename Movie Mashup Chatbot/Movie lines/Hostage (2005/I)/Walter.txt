You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
You won't die if you let me help.
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
I'm going to my desk.
The car.  All you want is the car?
Who sent you?
Jen?  Are you all right?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Did you find the disks?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where are my children?
