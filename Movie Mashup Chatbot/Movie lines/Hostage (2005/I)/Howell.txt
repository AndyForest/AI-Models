Are you out of your mind?
Donuts here any good?
We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
What hospital?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
What do you mean?
Give me an ETA.
You'd better be kidding.
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
All right.  Now the second one.
Where is it?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
What do you want?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
How did you get this number?
