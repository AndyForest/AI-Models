I know.
Shh, they'll hear you!
I'm not gonna leave you!
We can't carry him.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Be quiet!  Listen!
No!  They're right here --
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Yes, sir.
I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
He has lots of disks.
What do you want me to do?
Okay.
I think so.
Is my daddy okay?
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
In my room.
We're okay.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
