Smith will know.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
Where's your gun?
