I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
