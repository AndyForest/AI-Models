Get to work.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
Keep trying.
You get anything on Smith?
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
What'd you find out?
Talley.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
Give up.
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Let me come get him.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
I gotta piss real bad.
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I'm here.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
You have his address?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
Can you identify this man?
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
Close.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
You said they would be here!
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Yeah.
I think you got no choice.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
I'm scared shitless.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
Can we talk some more when you get here?
I still see that boy's eyes.
I need to work out some stuff.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Keep your head down.
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
Holster your guns!
Are civilians inside?
Another minute.  Please --
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
Just one question.  Please.
Smith!  Wake up!
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Is something wrong with Jane?
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
That's not enough.
Where are they?
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Stand by.
What's wrong with the radio?
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
You have her cell number?
Go.
Tell her I'm almost home.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Louise?
Get a phone number for the Smiths.
Louise?
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Let it go, Captain.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
You want me to stick around, I could --
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
He says that his father's hurt.
That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
Go, Mickey.
It's mine.  Talley.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Go, Mickey.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
The kids are in here!
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
We've got to get those kids out of there!
What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
What are you people going to do?
Special Agent Jones.
What?
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
Are all of you named Jones?
Are the disks still in your room?
Who is it?
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
Can you open them?
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
Can you get into the office?
I thought they locked you in your room.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
Where are you right now?
How about you and your sister?
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
How do I reach him?
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Yes.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
They're still in the house.
These disks . . . where are they?
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
Marlon and Al....
You can let go.
What do you want?
Who are you?
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
What do you mean by that?
Your phony FBI assholes.
I guess we do.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
