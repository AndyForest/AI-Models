What do <u>you</u> use it for?
What the hell is that, anyway?
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
You can't fight'em that way...
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Ready as we'll ever be.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Howdy, Rhonda.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
So...now what?
No.  We go straight.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
You know, up the jeep trail.
You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Yeah...but no ties.
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Road's in!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
What the hell are you doing?!!
I want to live for the three days.
Use the fucking bomb!
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Like hell you are.
We got a plan!
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
I'm gonna kick his ass!
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
You go north, I'll go south.
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
Don't he have a home to go to?
Well, folks, what's the plan?
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
I think we wait right here.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Prairie dog burrow...
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
This is one big mother!
What the hell are they?
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
<u>Why</u> would they do it?
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
A man who plans ahead.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
You're hung up again.
Val!  Val!
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Oh, Jesus!!
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
You got that right.
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
You're full of shit.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Adios, bridge!
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Has a lot of rain.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
You didn't cook breakfast?
