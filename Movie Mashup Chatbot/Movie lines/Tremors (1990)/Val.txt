BACK OFF, BURT...!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Burt, can you hear me now?
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
You are so full of shit...
What?
Somebody paying you to do this?
Civil?  I'm civil.
No ties.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Not yet, not yet...
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Only if something happens to me.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Its tires are flat...
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
We need another plan.
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
I'm gonna help you.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
Right.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Me, too.
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
Son of a bitch!
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Little sons of bitches.
We'll take your word for it.
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
You got <u>that</u> right!
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Sons of bitches!
Oh shit!
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Great.  Thank you.
The rifle.
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Fuck you!
I am not!
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
I'll go with that plan.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
Jeez, look at that guy.
So long, cactus!
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
That's the plan.
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
I'll call that little bluff.  How close?
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Well, sure.
Why?
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Do not talk to the driver.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Hell you did.  Your turn.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
Burt!  Heather!
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Twenty.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Could be.
LET'S DO IT!
Good point.
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
They're working together, too.
What's it doing?
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Think it's still following us?
You okay?
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Around here?  Why would they?
Yeah, geography.
