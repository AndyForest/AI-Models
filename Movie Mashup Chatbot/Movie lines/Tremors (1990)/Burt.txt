My cannon.
Cannon fuse.
How much you think?
You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
Roger that.
Yeah, still got one poking around.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
No problem.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
You guys all set?
Some kind of mutation...?
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
I think I scared it!
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Well, who put you two in charge?
She's got my vote.
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
In a minute.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
What the hell you doing back already?
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
