Thank you. Goodbye, John.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Have you discussed this with them?
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
What's in it?
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
John, how are you?
