No. I'm sore.
Can you use these?
OK.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
They don't scare me any more.
I don't think so.
About what?
I am.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.
Mm.
Mm.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
Trask wants to talk with you.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
I called Trina.
Where'd you spend last night?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Go down in my room.
Bree --
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
Drop it.
Don't touch anything.
I was wondering what that was.
What?
What am I supposed to say?
Yeah.
Yup.
Mm.
My bed.
I don't like getting splashed.
We did this before.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
How can you do it to yourself?
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
The same as Jane McKenna.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
But if it's someone else I do.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
What's the matter?
Don't worry.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Thanks.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Mm.
Not much point to this, is there?
It's kind of late.
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Yeah, you got to me.
Well --
No, I said what did you think.
And I don't think that was Tom.
Try some other ways.
I don't see anything, do you?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
You said you wanted these.
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
No.
Is that what you gave him?
Well, let's go down and ask him.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
What do you think?
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
No thanks.
-- OK?
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
OK.
-- OK --
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
How else do you meet them? Pimps?
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
What about everything since?
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
-- Tuscarora --
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
Could I ask some questions?
No, I'm look --
Mm.
Mm.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
My name's John Klute.
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
Well --
Just send me a money order.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
Yeah.
Well as a matter of --
Well there's a couple --
How is it back there?
It's got to make sense some way.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
I better keep looking.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I believed her, Pete.
Goodbye, Pete.
All right.
I wanted to give it to you first.
It's in the report.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
It's not so bad.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
She told me.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
I've just got a few --
I think she's trying that.
Has she talked with you since prison?
Did she talk about him to you?
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
No.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
No.
No.
We grew up together. Kids.
I know Tom Grunemann.
Town Police.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Nobody's seen that.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
I don't believe Tom's alive.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Yeah.
I looked it up.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
