Like for you to look for the man.
Here please.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
No, that's not --
I guess he figured it was better.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
Well we're pretty --
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
A few more days. We know who did this.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
What else do you know?
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
Think this is our guy?
Well?
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
