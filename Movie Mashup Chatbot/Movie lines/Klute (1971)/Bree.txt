Did he come around often?
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
Uh uh.
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
-- May I? It's so --
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Do you always have to repeat?
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
I do not love him.
Guess!
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Look -- could I use your phone?
No.
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Oh no.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
What was better? I made better bait?
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Why isn't he locked up?
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
So do I.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
I said yes, I see.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Will you let me go then?
Yes.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
-- Yes.
Yes -- all right --
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
What?
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
You could at least look at me!
You wanted to, or you are?
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
You're going back?
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
How do you know how bad it was?
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
With Trina.
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Right back at the start, right?
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Oh look what he did in them.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
You and I -- a relationship.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
Is that all you have to say?
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Please.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
No.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
I don't get you.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
Why?
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
How?
-- Then you don't need me.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Arlyn Page.
When?
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Goodbye.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
You said it was!
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
What're you gonna do next?
Is there anything more I could --
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Well -- she's dead.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
He never told me.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Can't you get him?
Well do you think it was him?
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
I go on rounds.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
What? This?
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
How would I remember?
Most of them.
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
I can't say he was anybody!
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
You remind me of my uncle.
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
Honest?
Why?
Gee.
Who?
You said that.
What about?
What is it?
