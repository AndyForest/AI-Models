Shut up!
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
Bartok... a question.
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
I cursed then all!
How do you know?
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
What?
I'll show you!
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
You gave the orders!
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
