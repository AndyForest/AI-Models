Then come find me.
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
I have to go now, before it gets light.
I'm not sure but look. . .
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
Poor Meetoo!
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Not you. Him.
You'll laugh.
No! I look ridiculous!
You must have.
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
Who's Sophie?
I'm fine.
Noooo....
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Well, I don't have any money . . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Don't let me go!
Dmitri?
I'm glad you	did too.
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
I'm so scared...
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Oh! I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
You said you wouldn't laugh!
What a beautiful ship!
The dessert fork!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
No!
HUH?!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Why?
I'm going to stretch my legs
By pulling my hair?!
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
I have my reasons.
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
And this is my future. This is who I am!
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
Why does everyone have to act that way?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
