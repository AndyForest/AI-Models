I'll never let go!
Anya... where are we?
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
No! Well, yes, but
Anya, wait!
Don't be
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
Nervous?
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Sad?
It's not you - it's the dress!
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
It's the best fork of all
Every Russian family has one..
You are the Princess.
You must enjoy causing me pain!
Come on!
Now just get off the train.
Trying... to... breathe...
Come on up!
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
I was all out of dynamite!
I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
You never thought of the possibility?
Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
What happened to your parents?
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too
Who are you?!
That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
Watch me.
What do you mean?
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
It worked in Odessa...
How is our current financial status?
See? The Princess is under there ...
Pray he's color-blind...
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
You're a princess...
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Hurry up with those papers.
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
Look!
It's her.
What was that?
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
Run, Anya -  go...
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
What do you want?!
Rasputin!
And tell me that she's happy.
Promise me she'll have her home.
I should go
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
No. Empress, you --
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
Please, if you'd just listen...
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
