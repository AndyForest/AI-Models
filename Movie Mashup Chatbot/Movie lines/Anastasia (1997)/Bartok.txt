PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
I'm getting a chest cold..
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
You'd lose your security deposit?
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
Trust me, it's her!
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
