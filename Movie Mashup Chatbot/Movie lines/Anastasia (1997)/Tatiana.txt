Get on! Anastasia, get on!
When you're older . . .
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
What were you showing her?
Why were you so late tonight
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
Yes, you do. You do.
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Is it? Is this what you want?
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
Don't you, child?
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Do you remember this?
Who are you, child?
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
She does.
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
You are the boy ...
Young	man, I...
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
Remove him at once.
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
