No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Yes, your highness.
Yes, your highness.
I shant!
Come out! I can do alterations.
Did I tell you that?
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Is everyone all right?
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Good day!
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Who did you hear it from?
So where will you go?
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
Are you feeling all right?
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
The "Odessa Dunk"?
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
Ah! Let us begin!
What do we do now?
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Ew. . .  the honest type.
He's her?
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
Perhaps you could convince her?
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
