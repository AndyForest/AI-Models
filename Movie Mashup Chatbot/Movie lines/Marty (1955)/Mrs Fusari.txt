You should be ashamed of yourself.
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Well...
I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
