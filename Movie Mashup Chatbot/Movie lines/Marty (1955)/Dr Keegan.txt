Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
What?
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
No, I'm not kidding.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'll see you around.
Where you going now?
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
