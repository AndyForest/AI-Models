I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
I gotta work with these women.
Loretta, don't do that.
Airport Ho-Jo!
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
Okay.
Really?
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
Loretta, never have kids.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Really, Loretta?
Oh-yah.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
So, what do I say?
Oh God, I'm dead...
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
Where is she?!
Is Mom okay?
Yah?
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Your parents'd kill you.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Mrs. Leeman?
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
I'm gonna need more caps.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
It's okay.
Bye mom.
I love you much.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
Ow!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Mom!
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
This, this... This is bullshit!
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
I hate her!
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Bitch!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
I just did.
You heard me. Where is it?
What're you doin' here?
Yes, Leslie!
Yes...
Yeah...
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Here, I didn't get any.
Bye.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
I know.
Then it must be Wednesday.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Hi.
