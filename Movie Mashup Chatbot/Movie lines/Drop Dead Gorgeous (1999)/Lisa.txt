Oh-you-beccha.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Amber? Here.
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
Oh, Amber...
