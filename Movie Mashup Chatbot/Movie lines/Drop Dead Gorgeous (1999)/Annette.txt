C'mere. I love you so much.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
What?!
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Go on! Get out!
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
Oh shit!
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
They told me to practice.
We was robbed.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
You don't know where this is gonna...
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Loretta, shut it.
This here's Loretta.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Hi.
You could be quiet.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
