Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
This came for you, sweetie.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
What is wrong with you?
Thank God for bunge cords.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
You-betcha.
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Yeah, you betcha...
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
You're what?!
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
She's right over there.
She's alive, sweetie.
Annette, just use your hand.
Okay. Take her purse.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
Anyone?
So? Be real easy.
I got a hairdo.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
Oh, naw. Hi.
Hi.
Are we on "Cops" again?
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
