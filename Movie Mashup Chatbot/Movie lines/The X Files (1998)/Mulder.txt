Sorry. Don't have one.
Does what?
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
Yup.
I need your clothes, Byers.
They took her --
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
When was that?
Penetration but not perforation.
What am I doing here?
No. Don't bother.
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
What's that?
I'm looking for him.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
Have you examined them?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
You didn't know my father --
You've been using me --
You told me you had answers.
Your guess?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
What did it look like?
I'm not sure. A virus --
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
How can I reach you?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
Negotiating with whom?
A plague?
I'll know soon enough.
What killed those men?
What was it?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
How?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
Not according to the men in blue.
I think you're full of shit.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
Before the bomb went off?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
He just let it explode.
And what's that?
Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
Who sent you?
You a reporter?
How'd you find me?
I know the name. Why?
You follow me out here for a reason?
Do I know you?
How's that?
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
We've got to keep moving.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
Scully --
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Scully...
What? What happened?
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I need you on this, Scully --
Just like that --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
You can't quit, Scully.
What? What's wrong?
I don't know.
Come on!
Run.
Scully....?
Maybe. Maybe not.
You hear that?
For the purpose of what?
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
Very weird.
I have no idea.
Been where?
It may be extraterrestrial.
This virus -- it...
Yeah, well they may this one.
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
What?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
You think they went left?
Where would they be going?
What are my choices?
And where are they going with it?
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
This looks like new grass to you?
And you've never seen anything like that?
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
How was it contracted?
What did you find?
You said you weren't coming?
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
What kind of infection?
What did you find?
Why are you whispering?
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
I'd been told as much.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
It's like jelly.
According to this tag.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
Get dressed, Scully.
Is that what you'd like me to do?
What are you implying, Scully?
I was until about an hour ago.
Why not? It's three AM.
I wake you?
You're... quitting?
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
They were the ones that put us together.
Why?
What? What are you talking about?
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
Something's not right...
Scully?
...thirteen fifty six...
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
I'm in the vending room.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
No you didn't.
It's locked?
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
How's that?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
What happened to playing a hunch?
I think they have that covered.
You're looking for a bomb.
What's wrong, Scully?
Did you find something?
Where are you, Scully?
Thank you.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
Well, call General McAddie.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
On whose orders?
We're going to the morgue.
I've got to find Scully.
Are we being watched?
How deep does this go?
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
Where's Scully?!
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
And they want to blame us?
She was with me.
About what?
What about you?
What alien environment?
How?
Let me out. Stop the car.
Where is he?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Why are you telling me this?
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
What do you mean, walked?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
A virus?
You're lying.
What is it?
I want to know where Scully is.
About the conspiracy?
Is she alive?
Where's Scully?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
