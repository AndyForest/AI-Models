What?
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
So what?
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
We think you'd be good at it.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
