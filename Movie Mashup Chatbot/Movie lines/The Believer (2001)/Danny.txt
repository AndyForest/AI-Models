The Nazis did everything the fï¿½hrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
What's a fascist?
They only kill them when they love them?
Just don't.
Yeah, but not on the letters.
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
I don't, but...
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Oh, please...
Yes.
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Then I won't bring you....
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint.  Give it to me.
What do you think you're doing?
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
I don't care about money.
People still need values, beliefs....
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
I have a job.
You gotta get out of here.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
And be crushed.
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
You want a punch in the mouth?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Nazis talk about it all the time.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
No, I think you shouldn't.
You shouldn't.
Don't curse in front of it.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
No difference.
V'asitem...
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
Even though his dick is so big?
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
You can't curse in front of it either.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Yeah, it's stupid.  Put it on, or I won't teach you.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Why?
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
What do you care?
No.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Your father??
When can I see you?
Why won't you talk to me?
Then how come you're talking to me?
Oh, really?
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
What's he care about?
Is he a Nazi?
Are they still together?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
You want it to be an event.
I just read it....
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Too difficult?
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I didn't realize you cared.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
I'm stealing it.
Nothing. Let's go....
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Who's Eichmann?!!?
I'll go look....
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to --
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
It's the truth....
They're liars and cowards.
I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
Obviously.
Get the fuck away from me.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
What were you, following me?
No.
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Listen to me....
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Who? How would I know him?
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Those aren't Jews.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
And? WHat did you notice?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
I agree.
What about Curtis Zampf?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
Fucking kike.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
I can't say that.
But I wasn't.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
You're lying.
A forty-five.
With the shoes... There was more than one?
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
How did you...?
I can't help what I think.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
To hear them read Torah.
I always won.
No!
Don't tell me what I --
I don't do that.
How did you get the fucking number?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Fine.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
From the Rhineland originally.
It's German.
Daniel Balint.
Steve's going to explain it.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
What about chicken?
I've got to get back to the --
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
What kids?...
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
They're not my people....
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
Who knows what that is?
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
Who told you that?
<i>New York Times</i>...?
Hello...?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Just do it.
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
I have an idea....
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Mrs. Moebius.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Not too fast.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Here...
Shut up. Fuck you....
What is it?
The mother.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
You could do it.
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Which was his room?
Get out of my way.
Shut up...
Wow, that's uh...great...
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
JTS...?
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
How?
How did you know they were Jews?
Who'd you kill?
Why me?
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
What do you think you should have done?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
And what did you do?
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Valentine...
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
Adam Sandler.
Howard Stern.
No.
Dennis Leary.
"Do chickens give milk?"
It's Friday....
Do you think I...
I was just trying to make a point. If --
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
We tested the new bomb.
They're not that Jewish.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
Fund-raising??
Oh, fuck you...
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
Eat shit....
