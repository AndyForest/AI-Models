You shut up. Who do you think you are?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Think about your father. Your sister.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
It was a nine millimeter.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
This is me.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
I thought you hated Torah.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
The arguments, anyway.
