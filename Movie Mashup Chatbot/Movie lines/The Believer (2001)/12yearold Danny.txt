Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
