You don't own this place.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
No. What are you looking for?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Lina, come here!
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Do they?
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
You think I should just because there's no reason?
Why should I submit?
Fuck that.
And belief follows?
What's it about?
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
With you there's a tragic dimension.
The sex is better.
Where are they?
It looks a little like a swastika.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
What assholes.
That's stupid.
Why not?
I'm good at languages.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
I want to learn to read it.
What's it mean?
Oh, yeah...
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
How come there's no punctuation?
Where'd you get this?
No.
He's at a home out here.
You can't.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
Who's Linda?
Bigger and better.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
That's stupid. Why would they?
Killing himself.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Why no silencer?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
You're not in school? What do you do?
Which is what?
Disease? What disease?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
