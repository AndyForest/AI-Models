You will.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.

You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
