Yes sir.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
I didn't know sir.
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Yes, Sir.
Fifteen.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
What do you mean?
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
