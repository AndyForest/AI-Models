Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
He's a big boy.
Take good care of my son.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
Who is it Philip?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
Oh, really?
Spying?!
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
