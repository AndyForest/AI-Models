Claiming their place in the world.
Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences.  It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Why did we begin this?
I can take it.
Guilty.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
You sound so sure.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
He would have loved this.
Yep.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
Did we lose anybody?
North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
Carry on.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Well, that's all part of it.
Come in.
It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Good.  Let's go sailing.
Everyone aboard young Bill?
You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
They have every right Chuck.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
Close the door.  Sit down.
Can't do it.
Well, spit it out.
What's on your mind?
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
Uh, huh.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
You all right?
All stop on the engine.
Unfurl the squares!
Speak up boy!
Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out.  I want to know that you've heard and understand.  Raise the mainsail.
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
So is violating international law.
What is it we can do for you today?
And, of course, we are.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
I know.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
She's Cuban.
They'll know about it in the morning.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
A padlock.
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
You're officer of the watch, George.
You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
You do?
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
What's that?
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
Outer.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
Then keep your mouth shut.
Do you have something to say?
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
What are you blubbering about?
Sorry won't cut it.
What's it going to be?
Up you go.  Right now.
Swing up, son.
Yes.
I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
Yes, that's true.
For killing a dolphin.
They are much more than that, sir.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
I can't be sure.
No.
Yes, I was.
He climbed when he was ready.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
No.  I didn't.
I am accountable.
... Absolutely not.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
It wasn't hard.
I understand.
