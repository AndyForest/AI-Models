Thank you.
How old are you, son?
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
What makes you so sure it was one?
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
