I can't go in there.
I can't make it out?
I couldn't.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
That's how he died you know.
It works?
Who told you that?
It was so real...
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
Where are you from any way?
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
My parents don't do it anymore.
What'd you do?
So... What happened?
Come on man, what'd they look like?
Ya know... "It".
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
Forget it.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Fine.
I can't watch this.
What the hell is going on?
Why, man?
It matters to me.
I figured it out.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
What?  Come on...
How would you know?
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
I couldn't do it.
Why'd you jump?
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Phil.  What are you doing?
But, they don't speak English.
What are we supposed to talk about?
How long you been standing there?
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
Aaauuuhhh!!!
I can't.
I don't know...
I'm sorry...
What?
