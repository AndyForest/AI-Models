I know enough.
I gotta go.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
I guess.
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
What's the difference?
Like this!
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Hey, shut up will ya?
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
It has nothing to do with him.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
I can take care of myself.
Why are you here?
I should be eating with the crew.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Me, too.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
About anything.
It hurts too much to care.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
Son of a bitch!!
It's outta here!
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
You've gotta be kidding?
Long enough.
I'm not gonna kill it.
Joy, rapture...
I'm not staying out here.
No, sir.
No.
Suicidal...
Sir.
