When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Fine.
Okay.
Yeah, sure.
Where's Mom?
Yes sir.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Whatever.
Gieg, Chuck.
Yeah.
I feel like... we can do anything.
You know, I never had friends like this.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
Anonymous.
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
Feels different doesn't it?
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
What about you?
Ninety-six.
You okay?
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
You're not a moron.
What?
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
Where you going?
Yeah.
So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
What do you mean?
He does.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Because it looks good.
That's not why he's sending me.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Is it true Phil?
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
Can we talk?
You only hurt yourself you know?
Why'd you do it?
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Shut up, Phil.
It was a bad dream...
But that's not the point...
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
We all have problems.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
Look, I just better go.
Yes.
Me too.
No, I didn't.
What are you talking about.
What are they doing?
Jesus, you never told them?
Who?
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
My dad.
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
How do you know?  They might.
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
No way!
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
Do what?
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
I feel like I got you into this.
I just brought you something to eat.
Good.
How ya doing?
Jesus.
Maybe it's an air raid.
I don't know.
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
Of what?
He killed the dolphin.
Sir...?
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Shouldn't we turn away?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Face what?
It was my fault.  I slipped.
Yes, sir.
Northeast sir!
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Yes sir.
