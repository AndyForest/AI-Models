Who did this to you?
My God, you're shot...
What happened... ?
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
Why are you doing this?
Tyler...
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
Let go of me!
What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
You are an insane person.
What?
Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
What?
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
You got about thirty seconds.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
I've done you enough favors.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
What... ?
What is wrong with you?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Is that what you're calling it?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Is this a trick?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Yeah?
What?
Can I come in?
You're afraid to say.
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Guy or girl?
What is this?  Who did this?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
Hear what?
What do you get out of it?
It was the smart move on her part.
Do you care?
Chloe's dead.
Whatever.
Well... thanks, anyway.
I could check your prostate.
I wish I could return the favor.
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
You feel nothing?
Make sure.
Feel anything?
Here.
Here.
Good.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Please.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
What... ?
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Like testicular cancer?
Really?
You haven't been going to yours.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
I suppose.
Should we?
Looks like this is goodbye.
Deal.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
I want that.
I want brain parasites.
I'll take the parasites.
I don't know -- am I?
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
Really?
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
And I saw you practicing this...
What?
Sure.
