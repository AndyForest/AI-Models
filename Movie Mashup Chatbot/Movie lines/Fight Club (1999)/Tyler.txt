What?
What?
What?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
What are you doing?
You will.  You know you will.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
I'm doing this for us.
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
You need me.
Why what?
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Proceed with remote detonation.
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Damn it!  God-damn it...
What?
What the fuck -- ?
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
One minute.
Defuse the bomb?
Ask me nicely.
What?
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
You want out?
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Green?  Did you say green?
This is not about martyrdom.
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
...to let this happen!
...stop me?
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
What a ridiculous thing to say.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
Um, well... technically, no.
What about Marla?
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
The house is rented in your name.
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
And, sometimes you control it...
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
Is this really news to you?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
Why do people think anything?
Why did you do that?
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Four in Milwaukee.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
You're too young.  Sorry.
... is over.
What are you talking about?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
I want to hear the truth.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
What should I have told you?
Something on your mind?
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Hey.
Imagine how he feels.
I asked you what you studied.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
Homework assignment.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
Fucking sweet.
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Yeah.  Where you headed?
No thanks, I quit.
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
We don't need him...
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
Look at your hand.
This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
A liposuction clinic.
Don't mention me.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
You want to finish her off?
That was three times you promised.
Promise?
Promise you won't.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Hey... don't knock librarians.
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
You're okay with this?
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
You're sure?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
Unbelievable, huh?
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Good answer.
Any historical figure.
Hemingway.  You?
Alive or dead?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Hum.
What car?
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
My dad.  No question.
Anyone.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
This fight, pussy.
The fight.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
But a good strange.
How do you feel?
Like hell.  That counted.
Surprise me.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Go ahead.  Say it.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
A nice, big cock.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
They're called "cigarette burns."
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
Yes, you can.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
You called me so you could have a place to stay.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
A hotel?
Do what you like.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
And, now it's gone.
This is how we fill up our lives.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
Being clever.
How's that working out for you?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
What do you want me to do?
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
Tyler Durden.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
It's getting exciting now.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Pleeeeeease!
You and your friend.
You're welcome to join our club.
Yes, it is.
It's free to all.
There is no money.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Would you rather be dead?
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Animals.
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Why?
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're going to die.
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
