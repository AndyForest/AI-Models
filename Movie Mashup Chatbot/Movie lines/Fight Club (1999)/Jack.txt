No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
What... ?
Right, right.
Where's Tyler?
You are a moron.
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
There's no one else here.
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Yeah, both of us.
Look at my face.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Oh.
Really, what's that?
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
We need to talk.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
Hmm?
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
Some of it, yes.
Yes.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
I'd like to thank the academy...
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
Who do you think could've done this?
This is... really a shock...
What does that mean?
Dynamite?
Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
No, I wasn't aware...
Yes?
I'm in pain.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Can't you give me something?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Yes.
Don't ask.
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
I'm sorry, but I...
Marla...
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I'm sorry, I...
Marla...
Marla, no, wait...
Say my name!  What's my name!?
Say my name.
What did you say... ?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
Answer the question!
We did make love?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
He's not here.
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
... A person.
No.
That... sawing and hammering.
You hear that?
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
I don't know.
When?
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
You... don't have to... leave.
Uh ... nah.
I think everything's okay here.
No... no problem.
Nothing.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
No.
Here.
There?
Where?  Here?
No, thanks.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral in her book.
I don't know ...
What are you talking about?
Goodbye.
It's time for you to leave.
It suits you.
Worth every penny.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
So you're staying in tonight?
This could go on for hours.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
I'm just on my way out...
Look, this is a bad time...
It's for men.
I found a new one.
That's the idea -- we split them.
How did you find me?
Marla?
In case we want to switch nights.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
The girl had done her homework.
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
You can't have the whole brain!
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
You're kidding.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
Please.  Can't we do something... ?
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
It becomes an addiction.
Yeah.
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Why are you doing this?
I'll expose you.
Practicing what?
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.  But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
We need to talk.
... and you come home to this.
Well... let me see... here's the thing...
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
Tyler?
Hello?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
Who do you think I am?
What?
Yes... it's a test.
... You know me?
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
My suitcase was vibrating?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
My eyes are open.
Look at me...
Appreciate something.
Do something for me.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
What have you left for me?
I swear on my life, I won't...
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Why are you doing this?!
... no, no, no...
Noooo, please...
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
Why... why... why... ?
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
NO...
Not exactly according to plan.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb.
Paraffin.
Please...
Can't you call it off... ?
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
I think this is about where we came in.
Yes.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb.
Tyler...
I quit.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Fuck you.
Yes...
I'm pulling the green wire.
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
If you know, I know.
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
Stop finishing...
I'm not going...
I'm going to...
I can't let you...
You... you can't be serious about this.
She's... you... you're fucking her.
What about Marla?
You have jobs.
You took me to the house.
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
What... what are you saying?
This isn't possible...
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
What are you talking about... ?
What... ?
I don't know!  Tell me!
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Why do people think I'm you?
What's this all about, Tyler?
"Training?"  Tyler...
"Applicant?"
"Too young?"
Wait a minute...
... is over.
This conversation...
Nothing.
What?
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
I don't know!  Nothing!
I don't think that's true.
I'm not asking you to.
What the hell ... ?!
Tyler...
What are you doing?!
I want to know --
Look...
You know what I mean.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
No.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Hey.
I feel sick.
Tell him!
Tyler...
What is it?
What are we doing?
I thought you did.
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Okay, and... and...
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
What... ?
Work.  Going to work.
You quit?
... Marla ... ?
We don't... ?
It isn't... ?
I don't know...
No, I'm not...
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
What is this place?
You get rid of her.
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
Huh?
Uh... nah...
I said I promise!
Yes, I promise.
Okay.
What?
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm sure.
No.  Not at all.
He was obviously able to handle it.
You?
Okay... Ghandi.
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Doesn't matter.
If you could fight any celebrity?
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
Show-off.
What are you reading?
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
What?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year.
Where's your car?
Same here.
I know that.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
Anyone?
What fight?
Call what off?
Is it?
Strange.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
This is crazy.
Me?
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
I don't know about this.
You get the idea.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
What?
What's that?
Thank you.
Can I stay at your place?
Would that be a problem?
No, I...
Huh?
I don't follow...
Yeah.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Don't I?
Well, I have to file a claim...
I don't... think so.
What list?
Insurance'll cover it.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
...no ...no ...
There's always that.
All gone.
I guess so.
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
Well, uh... great.
What?
Thank you.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
I mean -- for a living.
What do you do, Tyler?
No, supply oxygen?
This is how I met --
Pardon me?
Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Abort the plan.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Excuse me?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Who is this?
No!
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
