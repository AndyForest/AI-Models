Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
I'll ask the questions, son.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
It means it was homemade.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
The dynamite...
Does this sound strange to you?
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
