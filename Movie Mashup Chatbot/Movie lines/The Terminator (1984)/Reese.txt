Cover...our footsteps...
Sarah.
I don't think I like this.
What are you doing?
Ticklish?
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
It's better that way.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
No.  Never.
Someone?
Good fighters.
No.  I'm not.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Not possible.
My whole life has been combat.
Hot dogs?
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
Is this enough?
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Let's go.  Time to move out.
That's not my mission.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
That's the way it was told to me.
Molecular-memory.
What about it?
Why?
What's that?
Bag some Z's?
About what?
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Good field-dressing.
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
You'll learn.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
I'm sure.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
I volunteered.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
What?
It's okay.  Forget it.
I caught one, back there.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
Kyle.
Come here.
You cold?
Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
There's so much...
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
Right.
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
Do you understand?
Who is in authority here?
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Surrounded by living tissue.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Yes.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
