I won't let the fat kid down.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
Alright!
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Yes, Chuck?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
nan
I thought you did.
I hate the beige one.
You're a big help.
What do you think?
I'll do the same for you sometime.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
What's it to ya?
Aha!  Is she young?
You must have a girlfriend.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
What are you doing?
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
You're not supposed to.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
I bet you're ticklish.
Kyle...
Oh, Kyle.
And so you feel nothing.
So much pain.
A girl.  You know.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
Don't say that.
He'll find us, won't he?
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
I want it to be over for you.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
You must have had a fun child-
What's that?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
Kyle?
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
That's where we're going.
Thanks a lot.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
About where you're from.
Okay.  Talk some more.
You like it?  It's my first.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
You volunteered?
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
What's he like?
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
Reese...you got a first name?
Freezing.
The what?
I don't understand...
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Just let me go.
And you're from the future too?
So, it's from the future, is that right?
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Okay.
I can't sleep.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
