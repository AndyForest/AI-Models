Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
Here, drink some of this...
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Shut up.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?

I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Call her again.
Call her.
Send a unit.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
I know.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Give me the short version.
