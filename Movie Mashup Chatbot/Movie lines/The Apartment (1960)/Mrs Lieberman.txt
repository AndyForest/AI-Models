I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
