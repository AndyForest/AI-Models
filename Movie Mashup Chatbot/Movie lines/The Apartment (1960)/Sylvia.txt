That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Go where?
What gives?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
I told you -- with my mother.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
