You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
My shoes.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Good night?
Not so rough, honey.
I'm with you, lover.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
No kidding.
Say, this is Snugsville.
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
Still stuck on her, huh.
You got a girl-friend?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Family?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
