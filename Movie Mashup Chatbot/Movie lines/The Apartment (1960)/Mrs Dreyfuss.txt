You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later.  If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
What did I tell you?
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Something the matter?
