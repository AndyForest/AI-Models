Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
It won't happen again.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
