Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.
Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
Improved...how?
