Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Betty Elms?
