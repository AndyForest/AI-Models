Right. See ya.
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
I was afraid of that.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Wow!
It's unbelievable!
I can hardly wait, Coco.
No, I don't.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I...
Well, I ...
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Are you okay?
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
No, no, I'm fine.
Hi.
Very pleased to meet you.
Yes.
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
I can call them... I can call my dad.
You're still here?
Betty.
What?
Was anyone hurt?
Can you tell me what happened?
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
But it said #12.
Diane?
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
Rita... I know what you're doing.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Keep going. Go around to the back.
Do you know them?!
What is it? What do you see?!
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
"Before I kill you."
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"You're still here?"
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
What's wrong with that?
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
Call the number.
Strange to be calling yourself.
We'll take our check.
Not that I can see.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Mulholland Drive?
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
The money. You don't know where it came from?
You don't remember anything else?
How do you remember how to talk?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
What do you mean? You're Rita.
What's wrong?
What is it Rita?
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
But, this could be serious.
Oh...
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
Thank you... thank you very much.
Betty Elms.
Yes, Sir.
No, we don't.
Wally Brown.
To my audition.
