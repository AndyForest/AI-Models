It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
But I want to.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
No.
I don't think...
No... but...
Those men in front, in the car.
Don't stop!
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
Okay.
Good luck!

What do you mean?
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
I don't know who I am.
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
No...I need to sleep.

I think I've been hurt.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
