Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
I'm just offering a place to stay.
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Will you meet with him?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
It's been a very strange day.
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
You're broke!
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
They fired everyone.
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
Adam, where are you?
