Git along little dowgie and call me back.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
You gotta be kidding?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Cynthia...what's going on?
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
The Cowboy??
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
But I'm not broke.
And?
What do you mean "you know"?
Someone's shut off my money!
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
I'm going home Cynthia.
I'm going home.
No.
Who fired everyone?
What did you say?
What's going on, Cynthia?
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
So what's the problem?
Okay.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
I understand.
It will work out.
Okay.
One.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
Okay, I'm thinking.
How's that?
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
I agree with what you said...truly.
Sure.
Whatever.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Yeah.
Howdy to you.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
So, what did they say?
How...  how'd they know I was here?
... What??
Yes...what is it?
