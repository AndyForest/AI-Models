Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
