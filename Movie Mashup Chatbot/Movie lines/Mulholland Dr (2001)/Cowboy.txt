No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
You're an understandin' fella.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
What did I say?
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Beautiful night.
Howdy!
