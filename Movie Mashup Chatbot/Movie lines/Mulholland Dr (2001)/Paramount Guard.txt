Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
And who are we auditioning for today?
