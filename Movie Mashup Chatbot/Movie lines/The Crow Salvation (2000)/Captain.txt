I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
I hate that picture.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
Just don't believe everything you see.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
Could say that.
Good for you. You do know something.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
You know.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Shut up.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
An accident, Nathan.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
I mean Lauren.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
