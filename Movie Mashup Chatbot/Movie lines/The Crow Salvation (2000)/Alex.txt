Was that it? Well, ok.
You're wrong.
You sent them. I had no choice.
I'm looking for my friends.
Where are they? Last chance.
Where are they?
What? Call the police?
Where is it? This place?
The strip joint?
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
You think I'm crazy.
The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.
Two down. Two to go.
Dream on.
We won't.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
You killed her. I saw it.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
Think maybe knives do?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
What did they give you?
What did they give you?
Wrong. Answer.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
You lied at my trial.
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
The scar.
Good thing in a situation like this.
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
I was talking about you.
How can you die if you're already dead?
The scar. Which of you has it?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
I heard you were looking for this.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
... it connects you to me...
Erin. Who?
It's ok, it's ok...
It's what Lauren would do.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
Have to find him first.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
No. You don't.
Erin. It's not your fault.
No...
Are you ok?
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I told you, I knew your sister.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
He didn't kill her.
Someone else did it.
Your father gave them to both of you.
That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
I was a friend of your sister's.
