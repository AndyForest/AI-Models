Goodbye Arnie.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
So my wife is lying?
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
Don't bother.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
