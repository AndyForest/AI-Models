Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
That's good coke.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
You first.
I don't believe you.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
