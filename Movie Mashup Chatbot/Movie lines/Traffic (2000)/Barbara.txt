Where are you going?
At least she's alive.
My Leica's gone.

Me, too.
Should we bring the police into this?
Oh, it is?
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.

What do you think?
I don't know.
Not yet.

Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Honey, your father knows the President.
