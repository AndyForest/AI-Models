You will believe me, because it's true.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
What is he planning on telling them?
How much?
Why does he need money?
What?  What is it?
No.
He's not here.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
We keep our mouths shut.
What?
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
Not this time.
Your new friends.
Who?
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
The police won't find your car.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
I don't know.  Something.
Yeah.
I feel like a traitor.
This is a very different proposition.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
No.
Where?
But will he be house-trained?
Everybody has a weakness.
He'll do what I say.
Does this offer include my partner?
What is it you want me to do?
If I can.
It was an anonymous tip.
An informant.
Javier Rodriguez.
It's possible.
It could mean that, yes.
I'm aware of that.
