You will dine with me from now on.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
We aren't barbarians.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
Only if he can be trusted.
A small thing.  Nothing really.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
What is the name of your informant?
One question.  How did you find about this?
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
What's your name?
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
That would be very helpful to me.  Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico.  I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
