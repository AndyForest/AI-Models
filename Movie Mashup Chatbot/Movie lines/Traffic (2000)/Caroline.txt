He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot.
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
Is this bad for him?
Are you going to?
Did you tell Dad?
Sorry, but I mean, come on.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Did you meet the President?
You can't make me.
Like I give a fuck.
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
How long's the job?
Will we get invited to the White House?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
I get A's.  All A's.
I'm third in my class.
Yeah.
Cincinnati Country Day.
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
Yes.
Yes.
Sixteen
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Then here's a little bump.
Have you done your homework, honey?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
What is this, like freebase?
What are you doing?
