We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
No, you the man.
You the man.
Come back in a week, it will be squashed.
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
Ask Sal.
What?
That's it?
OK.  OK.
Gotta go.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I'm getting paid...
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
Innocent!
Nice!
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
I'll see you out.
Yo, I'm gone.
I'm coming.
What responsibilities?
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
I'm working.
Jade.
Later.  Gotta get paid.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
It's gonna be hot today.
Wake up!
Fuck!  My money!
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Mister Se�or Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
That's it?
OK.  OK.
Gotta go.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
You keep it.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
Quit bullshitting.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Sal, I want my money.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
C'mon, Sal.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
No, just checking.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
Can you pay me now?
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Se�or Love Daddy's show to you.
Run it then.
I got no say over people.
Talk to your son.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Later.
I am a man.
Tina, I'll be right back.
Tina, it's not like that.
To get my money.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
Meda.  Meda.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Lie down, please.
Tina, you're sweating.
No rawness.
Why you gotta curse?
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Trust me.
Trust me.
Then we'll do something else.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
I can't be staying long anyway.
I can run out and get it.
I just forgot.
Shit!  I forgot.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Tina, you are too slick.
Hot.  Hot.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Do I love you?
Before I get off work.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
It's e-vit-able.
I didn't know you could read.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
Remember what I said.
Smack him back.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Just coolin'.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
We're outta here.
That's what I think.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
Ya like him, huh?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
I love you, Black.
I understand.
I'm listening.
That's the dope.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
Whaddup.  Money?
