I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
Did you ask Sal?
And?
So?
What did he do this time?
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
...peanuts.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
You are too crude.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
He's completely innocent.
He's just being nice.
What are you so worked up about?
Stop tripping.
See ya around.
I'll see ya there.
No.
I'm going with you.
Hurry up and get dressed.
I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
How come you're not at Sal's?
I'm in here.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Whew!
And move to Long Island...
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
How are you holding up in this weather?
Sorry, comb got caught.
Yeah, me too.
This might take some time.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
