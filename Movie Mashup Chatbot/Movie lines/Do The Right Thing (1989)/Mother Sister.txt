We're still standing.
I didn't.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
Good morning.
You're welcome.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
You're a drunk fool.
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
I'll do.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
Jade, you're late.
