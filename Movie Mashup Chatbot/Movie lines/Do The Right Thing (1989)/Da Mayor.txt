I hope the block is still standing.
Where did you sleep?
I've done that before.
Is it a good morning?
I thank you.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years.
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
That's it.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
C'mere, Doctor.
Mookie.
You got a deal.
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
What makes Sammy run?
What makes Sammy run?
How old are you?
