Billy!  Please!
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
Hello, Billy.
