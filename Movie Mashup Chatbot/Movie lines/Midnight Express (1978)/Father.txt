Oh Jesus!
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Why'd you do it, Billy?
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
The Hilton.
Where'd you get that limp?
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
