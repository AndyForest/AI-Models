Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
How much?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Sixty Lira?
How far?
You know where they are?
