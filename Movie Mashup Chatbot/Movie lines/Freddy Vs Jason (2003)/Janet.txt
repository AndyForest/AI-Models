I really think we should go back...
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
I think we're lost.
Mister Biller?
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
That's not true...
No, but...
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
He... he's here...
Other guy?
I don't know...
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Hello?
