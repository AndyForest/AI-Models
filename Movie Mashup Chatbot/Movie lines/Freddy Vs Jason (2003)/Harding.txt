Who?
What happened?
What?
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
That's my job.
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
