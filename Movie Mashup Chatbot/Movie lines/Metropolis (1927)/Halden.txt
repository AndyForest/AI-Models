You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
God-Damn you!
They have nothing to do with this --
There are two million people in there with you.
What do you need?
What do you want?
This is Halden.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
How long?
How long 'till we can eject?
Insurance?
Need the disk back!
Times Square.
An interface attendant.
Come on Tanner, think this through.
There was no need to kill her.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
Why would I do that?
Not his style.
What did he tell you?
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Good question.
That's right.
He wouldn't say.
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
It's not used for anything.
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
What?
-- Christoph changed the maze.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
You're jumping to conclusions.
Go!
-- Yes.
-- He won't.
Two maze runners.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
