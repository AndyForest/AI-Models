And down here --
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Dream?!
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
You were the one who was dying.
It's not real.
In a computer program.
You are not a God.
Divinity?
Not my problem.
No.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Take care.
There is no --
Who?
What?
New York.
If she's alive, you get it back.
Insurance.
Where?
Then where is she?
Try harder.
To hide the evidence.
Then you had her killed.
Katie was digitized.
The truth.
-- Who did he digitize?!
Who did he digitize?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Why?
A hotel?
What is it?
The truth.
One condition.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
And you weren't involved.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
-- I saw the program.
Try harder.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
He had access to the keys --
Won't be time if he gets access --
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
He had keys.
Sorry?!
Not you.  A copy.
I know.
What?
Yes.
You weren't real.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
It was a test.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Yes.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
Corporation can.
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
Night City.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
-- You told me.
No.
-- Katie.
No.
I've got to get back.
