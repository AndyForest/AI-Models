-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
True.
Yes, I believe he has --
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
Yes.
I need to take back what's mine.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
Because I took it out of your memory.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
To live forever.
It's all been transferred.
It's okay.
From the dream.
It's time to wake up.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
Just like you always wanted.
The guests are here.
Yes.
No...
Someone who believes in miracles.
You were right.
Do you believe in miracles?
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
Your life that bad?
-- No.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
Only up there in the dream they called life.
One would assume so.
Yes.
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Yes...
Not real?
The new world.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
In here I am.
Yes.
So wrong --
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Then what?
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
True.  But why?
-- He will.
It's his nature.
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
Unfinished business.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
