Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
Why was he on Death Row?
But really, you never know.
But still, you can't be sure.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
Maybe it's for the best�I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong�People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
How did they execute him?
Oh. How did it happen?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
You have a bay?
Who is Jesus?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Speak English.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
Must've been hard being poor.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Really? How many?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Consuelo?
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Mom?
Twinkeys!
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Sure, Dad.
Gee, you're home early!
Hi, Dad!
OK!
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
You're welcome.  Dad?�Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Dad?�Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
