No prob. I'm cool.
Oh.
Like what?
What?
Hey. What's up?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Great to be here.
Thank you.
I'll be your guest!
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
What's tomorrow?
Fine.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
We did the same thing last year also.
I dunno.
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
Was anyone in my room today?
OK.
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Yeah?
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Just the same.
The same.
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
I dunno.
Fuck!
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
I dunno...
OK.
I hate reading.
No.
No, not really.
You want some?
Yeah. I know.
Yeah?
You should be.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Is it loaded?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
How'd you get it?
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Oh.
He did?
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Thanks man.
Can I see what you have so far?
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering�Is the documentary almost finished?
200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.
Prnceton.
So like, yeah�I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like �still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews�Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Whoopee.
Doubt it.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
What for?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
You a pervert?
