What's an audience going to tell you?
We're not ready!
We're not ready.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screeningï¿½
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
This is definitely better.
The camerawork's nice.
No, you don't.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
