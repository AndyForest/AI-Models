Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Oh, yeah?
You heard me: leave the table!
Out! Leave the table!
He isn't.
Don't ever say that.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Sure!...
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
We used pull.
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a�a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Reconceive.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but �
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Tired of this shit...
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
We have to talk.
Scooby?
Get the hell outta here!
The same. Same as what?
So? How was school today?
What DO you know?
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
I'm going in there.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Come here, give me a hug!
Hey, Mikey!
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Thanks.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
One in a million recover.
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
