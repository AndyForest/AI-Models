But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Marty, ignore him.
What?
Yes, Mikey?
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Don't even joke about that!
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
He's right.
It's all about who you know.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
Marty...
Got a lot of homework?
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
Ready for tomorrow?
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
How was the class?
What are you going to do?
Is everything OK?
