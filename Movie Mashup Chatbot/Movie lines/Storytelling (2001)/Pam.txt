OK. Bye.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Eight, six, and four.
Three.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. But not any more.
That's good.
Hunh.
I do.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
That's too bad.
Anything I might know about?
Oh, that's too bad.
I believe it.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Yeah.
But...you called.
So what's going on?
Great!
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Who is this?
Hello?
