I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better�
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
OK, you're right, you're right�  You know, we need to screen what we've got�invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types�and see what real people think of this.
Nothing, I guess�
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious�But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Yes, I know�But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
Yes, I do. I love them!
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
So whaddya think?
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
But what kind of pull did you have?
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Yeah, sure.
Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
Great. How old are they?
How many?
Huh. Kids?
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Oh, I don't remember that...
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Great!
Oh, fine. How are you?
Toby Oxman.
Hello, is this Pam?
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
What is most important to you?
Sure�um�yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
But what did you get on your SATs?
So where'd you get in?
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
