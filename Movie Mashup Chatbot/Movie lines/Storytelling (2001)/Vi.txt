I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
You know he hated my story also.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Oh. What happens now?
You mean, again?
Huh?
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Fuck me hard!
Nigger.
...gger.
Ni...
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Thanks.
Thank you for being honest.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Can I join you?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
What are you doing here?
