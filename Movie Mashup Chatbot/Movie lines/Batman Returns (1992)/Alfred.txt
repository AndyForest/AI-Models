Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
I think I'll take the stairs.
I will relay the message.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
