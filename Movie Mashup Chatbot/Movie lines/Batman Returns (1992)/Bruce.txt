Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
I guess this mean we won.
You'll never guess.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Alright, thanks.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
No, actually I feel worse.
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
It's cold.
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
No hard feelings?
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
What're you doing three dates from now?
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Photojournalist.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Nope, I told her everything.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
I'm tempted.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Didn't I say that?
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
We've met.
It does to me.
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
What happened?
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
No.  No glass on the inside.
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
