I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Y'mean frame him?
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
Silent night, violent night...
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
I don't.  So, no.
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
"You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot."  "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Wonder if it's worth my time.
Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
