Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
How could you?  I'm a woman...
Where's the fire?
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Your blood, Max.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
