Yawn.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Weird, huh?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
One way to find out?
Was.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
Son!
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Well it's not working.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Actually, it's a lot like that.
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
And a very, very good one.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
Working late?  I'm touched.
