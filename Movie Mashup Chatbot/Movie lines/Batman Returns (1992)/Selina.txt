... What do we do?
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
You first.
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Nor I, on the second.
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Sure.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
And the truth frightened her?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Yes and no...
"We"?  You and...

I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?

Treat to be here.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
Oh.  "Kyle."
Pouring myself into my work.
I'm listed.
Well that's a ... long story ...
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Yes and no ...
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Have we?
Actually I have to split.  Take a "personal day."  You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Too good?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
