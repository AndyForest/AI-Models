That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
Okay, Christy -- strip.
What?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
With love.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
A nun?
We didn't tell you what?
We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
We're looking for Mike.
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
Where is she?
I can't see anything in here!
Which one?
Which one!
Maybe pants.
Right.
It didn't work, Vince.
Yeah...
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
Not... totally.
It's a bluff, Vince.
And if she runs?
Vince -- is she... okay?
She's praying.
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
You didn't shoot!
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
She's gettin' away!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
