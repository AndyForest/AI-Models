Really?
Perhaps.
Well... thank you.
Oh?
Don't push it.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
I'm a Christian.
Oh?
Saving you.  Move!
Good day.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
I must go where I can be of use.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
You have a phone call.
The majority has spoken.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
Out of the question.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
You're my Olympic event.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
Mary Clarence!
Come, Sister.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Your cell is more than adequate.
And whom would you call?
Useless distractions.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Your cell.  Your room.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Yes.  Until breakfast.
No food.  Not until sundown.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
Until sundown.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
And the vow of chastity.
The vow of obedience.
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
Would you like that?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Check your driver's license.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
And all those like you.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
It has come to pass.
Your cigarette -- out.
Miss Van Cartier.
Sit down.
I see.
The reason?
You were unhappy?
St. Anne's?
Very well.
Enough joking.
Your name?
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
However, we can also pray for other things.
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
Really...
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
Sister Mary Patrick?
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Yes?
But where?
But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
I lied.
But, Bishop...
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
