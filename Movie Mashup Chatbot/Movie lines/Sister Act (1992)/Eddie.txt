I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Don't you have a concert to go to?
What're you doing?
Nuns?
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
I think they'd understand.
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
What?
Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
Vince knows you're here.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
Me too.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
I've been worried about you.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
I just need a few more weeks,
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Pray.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
No nothing.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
Maybe Hawaii.
Get a stenographer.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Then-you run.
He didn't do you a favor.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
So I don't shop.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
Where's who?
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
Then one day they find you.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
