What's she doing?
A sweater.
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
That's what I figured, too.
Neither did you!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
Where?
We both missed.
She's... she's a nun.
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
She's a nun, Vince.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
