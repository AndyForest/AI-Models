Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
What you do?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
How come?  Sister?
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
