I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
