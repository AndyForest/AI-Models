I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
Joey -- do it.
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Yes?
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
You are so damn sexy.
What did who say?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
Joey?
Willy -- hit the lights.
There she is!
Get her!
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
So, take it off.
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
Well?
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
It didn't happen.
What's the problem?
It's done?
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
Take care of it.
Maybe.
Find 'em!
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
Can you hold?  Can you try?
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
