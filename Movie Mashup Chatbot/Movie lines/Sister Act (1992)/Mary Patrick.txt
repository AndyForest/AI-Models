SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
Hurry, Sister!
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
What is it, Mary?
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
Am I?
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
I know.  It's ancient.
Two days.  An hour or so.
Chops?
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
You betcha.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
We've got to save her!
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
It should be here any minute.
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Measles.
Peace on Earth.
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Yes?
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Impossible.
Christy.
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
But how do we get there?
It's so beautiful...
She's our inspiration!
She wasn't a nun?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
It's better than ice cream.
He's kind.
He's not like other guys.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
Which convent was that, Sister?
