HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Mary Clarence!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Again?
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
Are you leaving us?
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
We're nuns!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
I don't want to mess anyone up...
What?
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
Oh my Lord!
Mary Clarence!
Mary Clarence!
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
I'm getting experience.
Who are all these people?
Really?
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Experience!  Right?
We need experience.
Mary Clarence!
Are you sure?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
What?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
You have to help me
A novice.
Three years.  Sister.
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
I... I brought you something.
I... I...
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Come on, we're late.
Not a note.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
A Benedictine.
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
An... entertainer?
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
Ice cream!
It's brought people back to the church.
It's better than springtime.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
He's decent.
That was exciting!
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Is this like your old convent?
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
Reverend Mother?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
She said they were from her old convent.
I don't understand.  Where is she?
