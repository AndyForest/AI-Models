What about crack?  You a user?
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
