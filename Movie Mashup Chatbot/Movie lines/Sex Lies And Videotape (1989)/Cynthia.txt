Bye.
Okay.
No.
Thank you.
So what's my share of the dress?
Hold on.
It looks like a tablecloth.
What is it?
Then why do you keep asking about it?
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
I feel like I do.
You couldn't do it, period.
Why?
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
No, but I did.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
He wouldn't do that.
I wanted him to see me.
Because I wanted to.
What!?
Yes, I did.
Apparently.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Questions about sex.
He just asked me questions.
Then why'd you call me?
Well, what, then?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Well, why?
Why not?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Will you stop? Jesus.
What's wrong with that?
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
And what?
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
What are you talking about?
Well, I'll call him when he does.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
I say it because it's descriptive.
What?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
So make an exception.
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I can't talk you into it?
No? Not even one more?
I'd like to make another tape.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Hi.
He doesn't have to tell me.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Prettier than Ann?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do you like the way I look?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
He said that my hand felt good.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
Very much live.
When I was fourteen.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Do I sit or stand?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
How long will it take?
And you ask questions, right?
How do we start?
Would anybody else see the tape?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
And that's all?
You just want to ask me questions?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
About what?
Doing what?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
She still is.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
You want me to leave?
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
No, John, things are getting real simple.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I know. Will you please leave now?
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Who?
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
How about straightening up the living room?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
It won't. I trust him.
No.
Hung up.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Why not?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
Right.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
I like the way he dresses.
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
What's so stupid about it?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
I don't think my sister would agree.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Hello.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
Right now.
I want to see you.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Not today. I've got other plans.
Hello.
John?
You are scum. I'll be there.
Hello.
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
I'm intrigued.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Afraid of getting caught?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
I did.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Why?
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
