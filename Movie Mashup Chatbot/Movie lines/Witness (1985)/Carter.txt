Say again?
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
You hear me?
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch ï¿½ I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
I hear you.
Johnny, what the fuck?
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
It won't happen again.
I got there late, John.
I didn't even know about it.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
He's got my number.
I admit I don't know where he is.
Probably.
Wrong.
