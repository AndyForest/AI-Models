Have you got your gun on now?
Are you really ever coming back?
Don't let them hurt you.
What are you going to do?
Are they going to kill you?
Is it them?
...I want to say a thing.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Okay, Mr. Book.
No pistol. Ever.
He was... like him.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
I saw him.
I wish dawdie was with us.
I don't want to stay here.
Momma... are they angry with us.
Is this where we're going?
