Here. Whenever you want them.
I want you to take this... to remember by.
That's God's way!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
You're so sure of that?
I was being foolish?
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
When will you be going?
But... You may not be well enough.
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
What else can you do?
You know carpentry?
We had some lemonade and he left.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Oh. The bullets.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
But Stoltzfus said...
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Buttons are Hochmut.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Enjoying your reading?
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
You tell him. When you're able.
But you can't.
Two days.
What?
Only the elders.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
But �
But why?
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
You couldn't wait until morning?
Where are you taking us now?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
But why would they murder...
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
But not a good tired.
I would not be too sure.
No you're not �  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
We do not go into your courts.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
It's not a joke.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
You have no right to keep us here.
Where are you taking us?
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
Good morning.
Yes.
Yes, thank you very much.
I have to help him!
You shame yourself.
I will be the judge of that.
I am not a child.
That is idle talk.
I have committed no sin.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I know.
No...
His name is John Book.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
My son is out there!
You might have killed him!
You have no right here!
No, you listen. Get out!
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
They are English. They don't understand.
No... No. It is just the English way.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
