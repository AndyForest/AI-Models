Move! Or you die right here!
Don't try me, Johnny!
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in �
Johnny �
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Who else knows?
What's your first move?
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Who else knows?
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde � what's-her-name � come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
You know who?
So one of them got to him.
What have you got?
Amish.
How reliable is this kid?
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
You're the first one he'll contact.
You admit you're lying?
You'd lie to protect him.
You know where he is.
But... if you had to guess?
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him �
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Not yet.
All right, where is he?
They don't have any shit.
Lean on him.
What about Carter?
I don't think she knows.
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
Get back in there.
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
He'll live.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
