Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Good, you start tomorrow.
Cows. You know, cows?
Maybe milking.
No, Rachel...
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
You are acting like one!
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws ï¿½
That has no place in this house.
Looks dead...
Is the English dead?
Who was that man?
