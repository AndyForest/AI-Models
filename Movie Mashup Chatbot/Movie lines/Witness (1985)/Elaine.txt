John, why?...
John, I don't understand any of this.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
I don't know where he is.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know � anybody who knows John � knows that's a goddamn lie!
Did you find him?
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
No? Why not?
God, Fred...
What's so funny?
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
You didn't have to...
Oh.
John said you're Amish.
Everything okay?
