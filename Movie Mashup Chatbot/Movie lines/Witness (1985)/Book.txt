Guess I'm not used to so much.
Not one this big.
I've seen pictures.
Milking?
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Just do it!
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
They're Amish.
Oh sure, Fred.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Sorry. It's important.
Pick up the hat.
Yes, sir.
Pretty much.
It's been a while.
Try the house.
I thought I was the English.
Sure have, Sam.
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
What's that, Sam?
Hey, Sam...
You don't say.
Tell you what � I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
Who'd you see?
It's all over, Paul.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
Just us.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Just us.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight � street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Yeah.
Oh, he's good.
Where's my baggy pants?
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
That's your way, not mine.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Aren't you? After today?
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
I know.
There was.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
Won him over just like that.
Not long... A few days.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
Sure.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
A real fireball.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
The... bullets?
I know what he said.
I'm going this morning.
No. I'd want a public phone.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Anything against zippers?
Hochmut?
Something wrong with buttons?
Your husband's?
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Tell him his tea stinks.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
How long have I been here?
How long?
Does anybody know I'm here?
Can I have something to drink?
Who are they?
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
No, no doctor...
I can't.
I was wrong.
Home.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
Because � somehow � they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Oh? Anything else?
No.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
They kid a lot.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
Whacking?
Now what's the problem?
What was that?
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Make that 1790.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
I'm coming.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
It's me.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Listen to me � Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens �
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
Anybody know about this?
