The thing that started all of this.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
Really?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
No.
What exactly?
What're we doing here, Truman?
I told you I can't.
How about them?
Who?
Your Dad?!
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
--Truman, what are you doing here?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Trust me.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
Nursery?
So when are you leaving?
Yeah?  Outta what?
