You want to book the flight?
I thought you were in a hurry.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
It's the busy season.
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Where exactly?
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
