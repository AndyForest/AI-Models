It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
That's right.
Why wouldn't I?
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
<i>A month.</i>
Today.
One.
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
<i>Fiji.</i>
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
--You never had a camera in my head.
I have a map.
Nothing was real.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
The creator of what?
Who are you?
I...I can't.
I think I've studied enough.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Saturday?
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
Lauren, right?
You take Japanese.
What's that?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Stay where you are!
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Yeah...
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
This is where it started.
I've got to show you something.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I think I'm mixed up in something.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
I've got to talk to you.
Marlon--
I can't tonight.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
You think so?
Yeah, what happened?
<i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
Who were you talking to?!
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
--What the hell are you talking about?!
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
I bet you did.
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
I think I'd like a little company.
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Should I?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Let's go now.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
I won't be here Sunday.
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
What do I do?
Arrah!
What's the hurry?
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
Good night, Mother.
I still want to look over a couple of things.
I'm not hungry.
What did you want?
How do you know?
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
It'd be an adventure.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
I've been thinking--
I won't be late.
How did it go today?
Gee, that's great.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
What's that?
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
It looks so small.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
How's your hip?
How are you, Mother?
You got it.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Well, thank you for your help.
Is there any way around?
Now what?
I don't understand.
Were you there--how do you know?
--How do you know about that?
There's no one here.
Who?
You can count on it.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
