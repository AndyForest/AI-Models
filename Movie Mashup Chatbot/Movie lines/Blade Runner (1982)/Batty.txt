That wouldn't be very sporting.
One man.  He must be good.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
What's the point?
Where?
Pris?
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
He knows what he's doing.
Well stocked.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
I've done some questionable things.
I am?
But not to last.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Why?
I want more life, fucker.
Death.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
You're our best and only friend.
When do you deliver your project?
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
His company made us.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
You could help us.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
We have a lot in common.
Like what?
Nexus - 6.
What, Sebastian?
Why are you staring at us?
Well, actually
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Hello, glad to meet you.
When?
What's going on down there?
