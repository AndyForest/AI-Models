Go.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
She's not with you?
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
You didn't like her!?
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Industrial refuse.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
