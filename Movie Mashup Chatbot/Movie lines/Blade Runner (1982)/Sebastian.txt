Just thought I'd...
Thank you.
This afternoon.
No.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
He could?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
Dr. Tyrell?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Of course not.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Like...
Show me something?
What generation are you?
You're androids.
You're just all so... so different.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
Day after tomorrow.
Soon as I finish the job.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
You're all so perfect.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
Good.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Twenty.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
Beautiful.
You look... better.
You scared me.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
We sure did.
What about friends?
Where are your folks?
Oh.
You want to go home?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
What's your name?
How come you were in my truck?
