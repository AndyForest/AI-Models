Yeah.  I got it.
Got it.
Who.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't like her.
She was gonna get away.
I was just about to have my dinner.
Yeah.
Garbage man?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Where do we start?
You got a machine on it yet?
What was he after?
Six, huh?
Number three.
Next.
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
The umbrella.
Not if it works.
Yes?
I think we're through for the night.
I know all that.
Okay, but...
How do I stop one?
You start.
You equipped for random questions?
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
Four years.
I don't know.
I gotta piss.
I like you too.
No thanks.
Prosit.
How long you had these guys?
Those cockroaches?
Sorry, don't have the time.
Prosit.
My pleasure.
Shot of vodka, please.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
It's okay.  Forget it.
These aren't just...
What's that?
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
No.  I got a problem.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I'm doing okay.
Sorry.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Me too.
But if you could?
Why didn't you go?
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Nope.
True.
Huh huh.
Yeah?
Meaning?
No rust?
What shows?
Book the good ones for where?
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
What's suck night?
What night?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What did she want?
Do you recognize any of them?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
Can I come in?
Taffey Lewis?
Me.
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
Sorry.
Does it eat?
It's a good job.
It that mother real?
For holes.
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
What?
Just wait here.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
No, I don't.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Because it's not.
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
What's a long time?
You mean a woman?
I never felt better.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Hmmm?
Like?
What?
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Not too good.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Dead.
Me and my dad.
You did?
You ever take a bath with a man before?
Sit.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Right.
I can imagine.
Yeah.
So?
I work alone.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
I've already got more help than I need.
Is there anything else?
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
In your opinion.
Why not?
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
Why should I be?
It's artificial?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
I'll see you in a minute.
Bad?
What's up?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Discreetly.
Five, maybe six.
She didn't know?
Thirteen.
If she is, the machine works.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
No.
Go ahead.
Yes.
Please.
Thanks.
