That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
You know what I think?
What difference will it make?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Ten years.
Uh-huh.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You're sick, Deckard.
This feels stupid.
But then how can you...
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
They could clean around the arrangement.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
That's another thing I can't do.
Did you cry when your father died?
I wish I could.
Do you dream?
What do people do in the afternoon?
How are you doing?
How come you're not on the job?
Oh.
Where is he?
Who is this?
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
I told you I'd come back.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
What do you want me to do?
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Can you?  I couldn't.
I'm sorry.
Do I make you nervous?
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
You use your equipment, don't you?
Two of us might be more effective than one.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
I think you need more help than you've got.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Ugh.
It would be my child.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
I'd never get an abortion.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
I'd kill it.
I'd take him to the doctor.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
Are you apprehensive?
Of course not.
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
