Tuition�s expensive.
Tails.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
So we found a compromise.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
A twist ending if you will.
And now, drum roll please...
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Of course not. Who wants to? What�s the point if we don�t get caught? Where�s the glamour in that?
You�re the one who got away.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
He hates Oliver Stone.
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
I got it..
He seemed harmless.
Randy somebody.
She's got guards with her.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Don't do this.
What?
He tried to kill her first.
Too bad.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
I have rehearsal.
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
Oh, Sid, you�re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
Can I come with her?
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
Who is that guy?
That was good.
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
What about rehearsal?
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Time to change numbers again?
Knock yourself out.
