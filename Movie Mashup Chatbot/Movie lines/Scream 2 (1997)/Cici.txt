Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
I'm losing you.
What? I can't hear you...
Outside.
Stop it...
I heard a noise.
Shit.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
I won't.
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
WHAAAATT?
Hello? Ted?
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
What if I said goodbye?
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
Cici. Who's this?
Yes.
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
