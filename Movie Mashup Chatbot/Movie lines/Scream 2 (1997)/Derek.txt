Yeah.
She dumped me.
Not one bit.
Definitely Whitney.
I think he's doing Dolly.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
Yeah, we�re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I�m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It�s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Good question. You took the bait.
That�s quick.
Go on, untie him.
Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
It's under control.
Let us decide that.
I think it's out of your control.
Lemme take you home.
About what?
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
Sid, you don't have to.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
We had to have financing.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It�s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
Just for you, Sid.
Or it found us.
And we didn�t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money�s worth.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing�s been done.
Hope you�re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
We�re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
The way I see it. We�ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Until now.
You�d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It�s a whole world, Sid. You�re really popular amongst the demented.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
I find his work overwrought.
I really don�t like that comparison, honey.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
Need some help, honey.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
What guy?
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
Where's Sid?
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
Two.
