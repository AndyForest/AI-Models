It�s over, Cotton.
Please, Cotton, don�t do this.
What?
Did it?
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
I did that.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Cotton.
But nobody wants to see that. It�ll never go. They�ll rewrite you. You don�t want that.
You�re not going to get away with this.
Why?
No. This is a set up.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
No, it's not.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I'll get my jacket.
The forbidden subject.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Whatever.
Dewey, there's no such place.
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Yeah, right.
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Oh my God.
But who would operate your camera?
My morn was a Delta.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
I'd really just like to be alone.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
Yeah, right.
Gotta.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Hello?  Hello?
But...
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
Thanks, Joel.
You're not allowed to ask that.
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
Don't panic.
I'll be right back.
He's after me.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
Do you work for her now?
What do you want?
