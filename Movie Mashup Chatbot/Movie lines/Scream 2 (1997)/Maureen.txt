Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
I get scared really easy, okay.
You are so not funny.
You ass.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
Now.
Take it off.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
I hate scary movies.
