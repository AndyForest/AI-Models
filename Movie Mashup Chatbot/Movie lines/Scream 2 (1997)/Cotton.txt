Not until you�re dead.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
It�s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I�m the victim.
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
It helped me realize one thing.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
You could start with an apology.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
Can we talk?
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
