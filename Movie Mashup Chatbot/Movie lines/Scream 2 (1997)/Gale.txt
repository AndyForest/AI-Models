Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
You have a right to be angry.
Did you do it?
But you�ll never get away with it.
What are you going to do?
Jesus, you�re just as whacked as your son.
You�re all in this together?
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
No, I don't.
Why don't you ask them?
Home--where he lives.
Tons and tons.
Good for you.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Fair enough.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Dewey?
Let's go.
Jesus Christ!
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
This is all too familiar.
Ssshh! What was that?
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
And Joel's pre-med.
..and as lonely as I am...
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Can we turn the light on?
What are we looking for?
Billy had alibis too.
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Not good. How you doin?
Yeah?
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
I never meant to imply...
You have every right to be upset.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
I see you read the book.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Hello, Dwight.
No, wait...
You're getting obvious.
What do you mean?
What do you want from me?
Oh--a God complex
Where are you?
What do you want?
I don't play games.
Who are you?
Who is this?
What?
Sid, I'll come with you.
It's good to see you involved.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
I'm sorry.
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
The safety what? Fuck that!
I don�t know.
Yes, goddammit!
Someone�s trying to kill me. I need the police.
