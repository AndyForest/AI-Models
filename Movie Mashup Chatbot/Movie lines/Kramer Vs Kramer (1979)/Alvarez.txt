Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
Good.  I'll see him in there.
Where is the child?
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
Mr. Kramer?
In real life when does he hit you?
Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
What do you like best about your daddy?
What do you like best about her?
Do you like to be with your mommy?
What about your mommy?
I see you have people there. What are their names?
What do you have here, Billy?
