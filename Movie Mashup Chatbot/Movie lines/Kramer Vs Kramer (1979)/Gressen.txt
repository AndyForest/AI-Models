Then I have concluded my questions.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
I do not, your honor, however--
Yes, your honor.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
Objection!
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Objection!
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
And yet you chose to leave him?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
And what is your present salary?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Did you wish to?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
And would you describe those years as happy?
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
So do I.
No questions.
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
Objection!
Objection!
Objection!
Objection.
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
And yet you fired him.
And how did you find his work?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
