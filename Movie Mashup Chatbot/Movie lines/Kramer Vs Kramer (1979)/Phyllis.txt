It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
I'm going to take it.
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Kramer--
Right.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Murray.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
Kramer...
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Yes.
Sure.
