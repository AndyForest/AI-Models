Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
That's not the point.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
I'm starting my own collection.
They've got the real thing outside.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
You're the biggest fibber.
He's the worst liar.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Where?
What is it?
Air-raid?
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
They might be.
A bit too quick.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Who said anything about love?
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
No, I won't.
Out.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
What would we do if a German came into the house?
He always knows.
After this dance.
You know it? It must be an old one.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
