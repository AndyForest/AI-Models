I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
What are you going to be then?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
You taste it.
It looks....foreign.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
We don't know anything about it
And what's that?
I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
You joined up.
Has Sue got it right?
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
They'd gone.
No Turks.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
I don't believe this is happening to me.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
What did he say?
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
What is it, pet?
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
There, there, my baby.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
And where do you think you're going?
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
The ideas you get in your head.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Half the time he's bluffing.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Just ignore her, Mac.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
Wasn't it lovely?
Up to six weeks, I think.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
I wish it could all have been different.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
He could always make me laugh.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
It seems to have survived.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
I can't do it. What's the point?
It was the best time of his life.
And now we're glad you did.
How long?
What did I do to deserve this?
Father, that's enough now
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
You're having me on, Molly.
Molly!
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
I know you mean well.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
