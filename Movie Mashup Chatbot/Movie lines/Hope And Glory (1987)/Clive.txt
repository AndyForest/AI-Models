The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
The sodding water table.
And the bride.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
Bugger the Buffs.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Except the servicemen.
How's your war, Mac?
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Why not?
What about it?
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
Kiss me Hardy.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
And Jim.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
Fair enough.  The river.
Where to?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
That's it.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
Well?
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Jam.
Oh, that.
What's that?
We all had to write a last letter home.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
