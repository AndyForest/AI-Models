We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
And absent bridegrooms!
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
So you're going to be a grandfather.
I will if you will!
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
Naturally.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Propaganda. We've been had.
You need trees for an avenue.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
Look after yourself, Grace.
You might still have a house.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
We did the decent thing.
Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Play something, Grace.
Grace!
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
