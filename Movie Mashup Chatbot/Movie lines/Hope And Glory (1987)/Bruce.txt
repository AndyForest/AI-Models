Please yourself.
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
I don't know?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
