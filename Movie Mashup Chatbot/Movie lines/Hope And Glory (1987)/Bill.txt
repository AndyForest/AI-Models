Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
It's true.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Very well, Grandpa.
But Grandpa, you said...
Why?
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
I know.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Can I try?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Won't they have maps?
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bloody.
Sod.
Bugger off.
I only know one.
Yes.
I don't mind.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
I know a secret.
I never was.
Looking for shrapnel.
No, she didn't.
Pauline.
It's easy. I've done it.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
You do it. You're a girl.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Could.
Would.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Well, for the baby, really.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
It's not the same.
Can't we just see the end?
...and six...
...and four and five...
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
I did see them. I did.
You said that last year, Dad.
It's like telling fibs.
But Dad, It's the News.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Who pays for them?
Wow!
What's that?
