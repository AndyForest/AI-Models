I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Nope.
JD.
It looks like ï¿½t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
No Harry, you can't.
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
Son, have a look in his locker.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
All right, furry muff.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
You all right back there, mate?
Son?
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
Try that one.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Is he on his own?
How long has he been in there, son?
