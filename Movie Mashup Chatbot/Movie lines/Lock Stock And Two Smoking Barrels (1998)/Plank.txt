My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
Yeah, one of them's out.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.

What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
Well, perhaps you can help?
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
