Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
A what?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Seven hundred for the pair.
Well, it's still a good idea.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
I'll kill him!
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
I'll only be a minute.
I'11 meet you in the car.
. . . What?
What do you mean, me?
Well, what did he say?
Right as rain.
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
What the hell are you doing here?
What do you mean?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Who's this fat man, then?
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
I think you're Nick the Greek.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
You know how much it is, Nick.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
How many feet?
How many wings have they got between them?
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
You would take a pain ï¿½n the arse full stop.
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Nick the Greek.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
What have you come as?
