Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Good, you can get this under control now.
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Where did he get a hundred grand?
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Good job, Chris.
They were going to pay, then?
Have you counted the money?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
It's pay day, ain't it?
That you, boy?
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
For half a million?
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
I will loan you the money.
I will.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
You got it all?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
I want your bar.
I like your bar.
