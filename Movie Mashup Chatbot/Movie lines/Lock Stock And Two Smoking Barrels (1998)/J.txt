What are you doing, Plank?
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
I can't help you, Plank.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Hello, can I help you?
