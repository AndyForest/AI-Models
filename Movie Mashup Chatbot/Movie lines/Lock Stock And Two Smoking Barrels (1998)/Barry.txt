You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
You fucking well have to get 'em!
I am not fucking interested.
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Where're the others?
You get the guns?
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
Like antiques.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
