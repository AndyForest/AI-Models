Yeah, Bazza, what?
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
They were . . .
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
I don't know what you mean.
There are no others.
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
Like what?
I got the money to pay for 'em.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Sure is.
That's no way to answer the phone.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
We gotta get those guns.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
