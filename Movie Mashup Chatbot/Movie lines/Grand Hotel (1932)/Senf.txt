I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
Good heavens. What for?
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
For me?
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
For me?
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Is that for me?
No, doctor.
Nobody, Doctor.
No, Doctor.
No, Doctor.
