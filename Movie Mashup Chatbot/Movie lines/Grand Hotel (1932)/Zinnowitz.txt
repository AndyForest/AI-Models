What a session this has been.
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.

She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.

'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
What's bluff?
What's the matter with you?
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
Well -- gentlemen.
But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me --
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
No news yet?
Have I kept you waiting?
