Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Such nonsense.
You haven't time.
Why not?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Oh!
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
Four minutes past. Please come.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
You are late. Hurry.
