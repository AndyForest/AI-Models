You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
Stay where you are.
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.
The Grand Hotel.
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
You are ill.
You're tired. I can see that.
Send his bags up to my room.
This gentleman can have my room.
