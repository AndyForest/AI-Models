And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Yes -- oh!
For tonight.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Yes --
Anything for you.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Why?
Yes -- I'd love to.
I'll do anything for you.
That was lovely.
You were very different yesterday.
Chasing what?
I'd given you up.
All right. We'll dance.
Of course.
You're very funny --
Where downstairs?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Free --
Aren't you?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Very little.
Money -- Ever heard of it?
No -- why? -- should I?
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Dictation.  You know...
Oh -- work!!
That.
Have you seen it?
Who?
You're a fool!
Not with strangers.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Am I!
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Oh yes, of course.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Later?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
What?
You don't understand that do you?
Money!
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Yes --
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Please -- please!
Really?
You dance splendidly.
You're trembling.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
Dance then?
Oh -- you would!
A man might what?
You like music?
No - absinthe.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Oh, no.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
Here, hold up!
You think so?
I had to arrange about the trip.
Well, he's a gentleman!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Oh, yes.
A thousand marks --
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
I understand perfectly.
Well?
Well?
Well -- you want me?
Nothing.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
Tomorrow morning.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Hello!
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
How nice -- your daughters?
...weight into the balance...
Cotton Company --
I understand you perfectly.
You're a little too fast.
Not too quickly.
No.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Perhaps.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
That's from skiing.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Moreover...
Me.
I got ten marks for that.
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
Moreover...
You pay me.
No -- only occasional jobs.
Moreover...
Moreover --
I'm the stenographer.
