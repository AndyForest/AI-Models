But how can he? He'll kill you.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
How can you be certain?
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
I don't know.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
And I you.
I don't believe that, sir. Weï¿½ve shared many disappointing journeys.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
Do you have a moment, sir?
With pleasure, Captain.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
No.
You're not here.
You sick bastard!
This isn't real.
No!
I'm only half human.
