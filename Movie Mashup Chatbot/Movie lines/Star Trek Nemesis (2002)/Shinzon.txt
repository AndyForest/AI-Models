I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
Imzadi. This is so good.
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
It�s too late.
That's your life... not mine.
I don't know.
Yes.
He is what his life has made him!
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Long ago.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I�ll snap its ugly head off.
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile.
I was lonely...
Hello, Jean Luc.
In time, Jean Luc.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
I know.
There is that.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Looking up at the stars.
Were we always explorers?
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you�d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
You don't trust me.
No race should be a slave to another.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
I know.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
Right now, you�re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
I have dissolved the Senate.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
I've never met a human woman.
No?
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Report!
On my way.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
You heard me.
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
How long until we reach the Rift?
How long?
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
Do as I tell you!
Find her again.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Are we prepared?
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Now go. I have some personal business.
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard�s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Silence, Romulan!
I have a purpose.
You don't have to understand.
I came this far alone ...
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
None.
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
And?
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
