Soon then.  I�ll save the last dance for you.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.

About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  There�s no crying in Starfleet.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
It'll serve you right.
