Emergency force fields are holding.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
An individual more like you, you mean.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I�d say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I'll take care of it, sir.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Aye, sir.
Sir, we won�t be able to bring you back. It�s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
Ready, sir!
Aye, sir.
Sir?
What's he doing?
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
