If you wouldn't mind.
No.

Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
Aye, sir.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Aye, sir
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
We're being hailed.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
Captain!
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.

I won't do it.
Intruder alert!
We're being hailed.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Should I raise shields?
He's a very unusual android.
It is... invigorating.
