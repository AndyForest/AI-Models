Not tonight, I have work here.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran�s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
How long does he have?
Dying?
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
Yes.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
Remember him?
Beverly, come in.
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
I think a skin cell�s the more likely of the two.
When was he... created?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole� me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I don�t show up for my physical on time!
Negative.
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
Divert power and compensate.
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
How can you be sure?
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
Yes.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
How long until we reach the fleet?
Fire!
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Well then... only one way to go.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
What do you imagine this is?
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
It'll only work for one of us.
A weapon.
A bit less florid, Data.
Good work. The download?
On my way.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Data!
I can see that.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Now, you make a toast.
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
So... To happy endings.
This isn't about me anymore.
Make it so.
Counselor?
I know how he thinks.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
How could I not?
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
I'm going to miss you.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Of course, sit down.
Counselor.
May I have this dance?
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I�m a talking head.
Thank you, Commander.
Open a channel.
Understood.
Do you have life support?
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
Number One.  You have the bridge.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
On screen.
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
That's an order, Commander.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
How long until he can fire?
Deanna, on my mark.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
We�ve got him!
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
He wants to look me in the eye.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
What programs were accessed?
Cannon fodder.
What do we know about the population?
Theories?
What do we know about the planet?
Just lucky, Admiral.
Not with the Romulans.
Understood.
New Praetor?
With or without the rest of the fleet?
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
That will never happen.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
What's this?
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
On screen.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Who was it?
On screen.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
No!
Not yet, Mister Worf.
If you don't mind.
What sort of signature?
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
Won�t do what, Mister Worf?
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Agreed.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Report.
We can only hope so.
And the Romulans invade.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
Can anything be done for him?
Away team. Transporter room four.
She's a predator.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
Counselor?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
A coup d'etat?
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if you�ll excuse me.  I�ll be in the gym.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Still well on our side...
I am.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Please.
But you want to.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
I see more than what you are.
Not so long.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
You know that's not possible.
And what of the Enterprise?
Why are you here?
We are.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
I won't defend my life to you.
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
You're not Reman.
What's this all about?
All of this so you could capture me?
What are you doing?
Why am I here?
In time.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
With a full head of hair.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
After you, Praetor.
New worlds.
Yes.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
I have no reason to.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
How did you end up on Remus?
Yes. The eyes have it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
What happened?
You know I need to verify this.
We need to talk, just you and I.
You know I do.
Yes.
Yes.
And the Senate supports you?
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Praetor Shinzon. We�re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
Praetor?
And you're not as we imagined you.
Praetor Shinzon?
