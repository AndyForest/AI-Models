You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
And I think that's case --
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
-- fuck you!
This thing's going nowhere.
As a tumor.
Pritchett!
Pritchett, is that you?
If you know where it is, get there!
It's not going to let us out!
What?
Oh. Jesus.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Shit, Pritchett!!!
What's down there?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
Did it work?
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
What is it? What's in there?
What's in there?
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
You said that was an accident.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
'Less the place really is haunted.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
-- closed.
-- the stained glass --
Oh, Jesus....
Prove it.
Best of a nightmare.
Take the gun.
This is nuts.
And we get this money when?
Jesus!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
You okay?
What --
Where did it go?
It's succeeding!
For chrissake give me a hand!
What --
Don't think it's even an issue.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
Price!!
This is the best we're gonna do.
That's crazy!
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
Better living through electricity.
What are you looking for?
Good point.
I think we should have taken a right back there.
-- you lose either way, Price --
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
You hear somebody?
And then where are we?
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
I don't think so...
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
Most fun I've had all day.
Why?
I'm better than that.
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
You've got your own TV show?
...Jesus H. Christ.
