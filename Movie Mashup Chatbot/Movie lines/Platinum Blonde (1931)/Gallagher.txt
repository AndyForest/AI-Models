I think I better go, Stew.
Goodbye, Stew�
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Yes - isn't it.
I bet.
Yes.
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Yes.
No.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
What other girl�?
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
What did he want?
Who was that?
Sorry, boss�
It'll be ready in a minute.
Yeah?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Very good.
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Here you are.
What could I be?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Conrad.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
To Old Madrid.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
How far have you gotten?
Yes - and I'd love it.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Hello, Stew.
Yes.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Nothing.
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
There you are�!
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
My error.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Not since you broke into society.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
It's the smoke.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
I didn't run away.
Well!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Of course I haven't got a nose.
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
�and that�
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
You what?
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
The boss is getting hoarse.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
