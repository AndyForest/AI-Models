All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
Look! Look! The front page!
Ah-ah-ah!
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Sit down!
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
What is this person doing here?
That's an excellent idea.
Oh, shut up!
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Are the cars ready?
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
What is it, Smythe?
Heavens! The man's insane!
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
And you struck him right here in our house�?
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
I beg your pardon?
Have you seen this?
This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic!  See what you've done to me!?
Stop calling me Mother!
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Get out of here.
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Why�
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand�and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
