Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Yes - Sing Sing.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Thank you very much.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
As one Tribune man to another�
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
We were classmates.
Yale '21, I believe.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
This way.
Fine. Have a seat.
You're the Tribune man?
Yes.
We just thought that�
I beg your pardon.
That's putting it crudely, but�
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
I don't eat waffles.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Now don't be absurd, Smith�  May I come in?
I suppose you know why I came�?
Hello, Smith.
Traps shut!
Well, at best you might deny it.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
I think you'd better go.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
I have it here.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
