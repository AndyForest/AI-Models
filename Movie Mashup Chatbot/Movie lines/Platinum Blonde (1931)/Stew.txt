All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husband�He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  �and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane�  �goes out and counts the silverware.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
�and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
O-o-oh, I get you�  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
What's the idea, Anne?
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
Oh hello, Anne� He types furiously.
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I�
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves�
Anne, come here. Listen�
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I'm not going!
I poisoned him.
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Gallagher?
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters�
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live�
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Now let's get this settled�
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot�
A little�? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
How-di-do.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me�
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
For what?
Sure, I'll take a chance.
So, it's obvious, huh?
No - give you another guess.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Just listen to this�  Adorable Babykins� Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely�!
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance�
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
You're all right.
May I use your telephone?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
No? Why not?
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
I don't mind her if you don't.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Yeah - go on.
Yeah?
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
How's that?
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
What do you want?
Impossible. Put it on again.
I'm afraid.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
No!
I'm not quitting!
Sure.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
My play.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
A what?
That's so.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Yes, sir.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Not on my own beat, no.
It has been alleged - yes�
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account�
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Well - it's only April.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Gloria Golden?
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
With me you can always do business.
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
Yeah.
Look, I quit!
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
Outside!
All right, outside!
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
You're my what?
Who are you?
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
There's nothing sudden about that�  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Hey, Gallagher!
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Right.
Right.
What do you know about Conrad?
Did who?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Been where?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Right!
Must be my wife.
Staring at us?
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Thanks, thanks.
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
�and those and them.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it�
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
And now for that twentieth crack�
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
She did�?
You don't.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Surely, come right in.
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
You quit trying to stop anybody�
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and�
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
Good.
A statement? Good.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Hello, Joe.
It's all right. Bring him in.
Sure.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Yes - the worm!
Good morning, everybody�  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
All right, Grandma�
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
Nobody seems to want to do anything�  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
With pleasure, Madame!
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
That's all I wanted to know!
A bird in a gilded cage?
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
It's haunted just the same.
Found no skeletons?
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Yeah.
You try it.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Now the lady said you may go�
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe�
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
