'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see�'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha�
No?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey�  Let me know when you're quitting.
Araby, my eye�!
Araby?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
What play?
And live on your salary, I suppose?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
Is that so?
�Mr. Schuyler .
Well, when are you quitting?
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Why not?
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Do you call yourself a reporter?
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
Come on, get going, get going!
Right - for the first time this year.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Yeah?
Yeah?
