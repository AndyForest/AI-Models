Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
That's a canary, sir.
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
I beg your pardon, sir?
Now Mr. Smith, now pleaseï¿½
Quite so. Quite.
Thank you, sir.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Oh no, sir!
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Drunk, sir?
Dawson, sir.
Your valet, sir.
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
How do you like your bath, sir?
