Dexter.
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
Exactly.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
Indeed? How interesting.
You're acting like a child.
That's ridiculous.
You can't walk out of here like this.
Stewart!
Your house?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
I see.
Good morning. What does this mean?
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
Are you crazy?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
What are you talking about?
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Yes - isn't it?
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Gallagher!
Oh yes you will wear garters�
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
I know that.
You wear them of course, silly.
Do you like them?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now�
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
You have the cutest nose I've�
Of course I am Stewart.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house�
Your place?
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
I'm glad.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff�
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
Oh, Mother!
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
You don't wear garters!
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Really?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you�
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and �
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
For the letters, of course.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
Will you step into the library?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Where did you get those letters?
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
That's considerate of you.
What do you want?
You may go, Smythe.
Certainly. Right over there.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Don't mind Mother.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
Mother!
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher�
Why�
Oh, hello Mother!
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
