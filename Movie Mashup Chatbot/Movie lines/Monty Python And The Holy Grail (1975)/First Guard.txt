Oh, I see,  Right.
We're coming with you.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
The Prince ... ?
What?
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Just you ...
Until you, or anyone else ...
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
If we ... er ...
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Leaving the room ... yes.
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
... and you'll come and get him.
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
