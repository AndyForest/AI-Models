Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?

And what do you burn, apart from witches?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Did you dress her up like this?
Bring her forward.
How do you know she is a witch?
Oh, just some friends!
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.  Now the rest of you stand |      well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              HECTOR |      Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              ROBIN |      Look out. | |  The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them.
