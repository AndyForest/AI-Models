Blue.
To find the Holy Grail.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
Farewell, Concorde!
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
And another!
Well taken, Concorde!
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Is it?
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Gosh - Is he all right?
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Sir Gawain.
No, I'm not.
No.  It's unhealthy.
No, no, we must find the Grail.
It's too perilous.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We'll cover your escape!
You are in great peril.
Quick!
Sir Galahad!
Camelot ...
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Well ... yes ...
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
