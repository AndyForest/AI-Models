No, no ... not "is"!
You said it again!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
Oh, please!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
Now - go!
And not too expensive.
One that looks nice.
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
We want ... a shrubbery!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
NI!   NI!
NI!
We are the keepers of the sacred words.  NI ... Peng ... and Neee ... Wom!
The same!
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Stop saying the word!
Don't say that word.
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
