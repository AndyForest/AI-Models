Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
Do you want to come and have a drink?
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
I can understand that.
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
They cost fifty pounds each!
Did you kill all those guards?
How?
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Not you.
Who are you?
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...

Listen, Alice ...
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
Rather what?
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
Father, lad.
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Where are you going?
Is that clear?
Yes ...  make sure ...
Make sure he doesn't leave.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Right.
No, not anyone else - just me.
No ... just keep him in here.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
Yes?
Got it?
Leaving the room.
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
No.  Until I come and get him.
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
