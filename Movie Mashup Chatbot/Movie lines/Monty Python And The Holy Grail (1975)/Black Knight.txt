All right, we'll call it a draw.
The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
I'm invincible!
Come Here.
I'll do you for that.
Had enough ... ?
What!  Just a flesh wound.
Course I have.
Had enough?
Come on then.
Come on you pansy!
I've had worse.
No, it isn't.
'Tis but a scratch.
I move for no man.
Then you shall die.
None shall pass.
None shall pass.
