Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
I warned you!
What?
It is the rabbit.
There.
There he is!
Too late.
Follow!
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
A Grail?
What?
Quite.
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
Greetings King Arthur.
There are some who call me Tim?
I am an enchanter.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
Look.  I'm warning you.
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
