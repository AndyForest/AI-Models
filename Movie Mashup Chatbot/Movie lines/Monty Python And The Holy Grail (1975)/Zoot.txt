You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
Sir Galahad!!
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
What is your name, handsome knight?
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
