I'm not interested.
Please!
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
What do you mean?
Through ... We found them.
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
...What?
Yes!
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
You don't vote for kings.
I am your king!
What?
Well, who is your lord?
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
The Britons.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
What, "is"?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
What word?
Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
What is that?
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
Yes ...
Of course.
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
A what?
All right!  What do you want?
Oh!
Oh!
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
Who are they?
Come, Patsy.
You're a looney.
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
You'll what ... ?
I'll have your leg.
Stop that.
Look!
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
What?
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
You're a liar.
Well, what's that then?
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
So be it!
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
What?
Well, what are you then?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Are you sure he's got one?
What?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Hello.
Who are they?
We shall attack at once.
What?
What?
There!  Look!
Just keep me covered.
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
No.  No.  No!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Who ... Who breaks out?
Now what happens?
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
What is your name?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
Who did we lose?
Charge!
Oh, shut up.
Je...sus Christ!
You got us all worked up.
... You silly sod.
Behind the rabbit?
Where?
What?
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Look, you're a busy man ...
A G...g...g...
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
You know my name?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
By what name are you known?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
Come on, patsy.
Bloody peasant!
Shut up!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Shut up!
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Be quiet!
Yes, I see.
Yes.
Well ... I AM king.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
What?
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
Old woman!
Good idea, O Lord!
Yes, Lord.
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Sorry ...
