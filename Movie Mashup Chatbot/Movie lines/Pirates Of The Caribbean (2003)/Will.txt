He didn't waste it.
No!  You gave your word!
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
Elizabeth goes free!
You can't.  I can.
She.  Goes.  Free.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
If I had known --
Why would my father send this to me?
I'm glad we got here in time.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
We're not going to just surrender!
How did he get off the island?
What?  He never told me that.
Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
I know.  That was for the smell.
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
Jack!
Are you certain this is the right way?
Jack!
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
No.
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
On what?
What's that?
Barbossa.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
Shut up, before you lose them all!
Just do it quickly.
Tortuga?
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
It's not true my father was a pirate.
That's not true.
'Bootstrap?'
My father.  William Turner?
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Aye!  Avast!
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
It's still against the law.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
I'd die for her.
Why are brothering with that?
We need to go!
Agreed.
I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
I can get you out of here.
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
Because you're a pirate.
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Where does it make berth?
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
No.
You cheated.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
You threatened Miss Swann.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
