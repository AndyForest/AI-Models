He may be.
I think he's telling the truth.

Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
No.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
You haven't seen it.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
You've seen it?
No, it's not.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
