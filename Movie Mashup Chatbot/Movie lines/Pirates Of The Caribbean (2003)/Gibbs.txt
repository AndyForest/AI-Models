How did you get off the island?
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
And you've got that, have you?
A fool's errand.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
Say again?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
Aye, that'll about do it.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
That we are.
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
