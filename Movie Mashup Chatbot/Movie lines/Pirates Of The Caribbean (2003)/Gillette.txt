Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
