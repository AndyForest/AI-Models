Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
We got that part.  Anything else?
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
What's in your head, boy?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
Aye, for us there is.
Men!  Are you up for it?
That so?
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
What're you suggesting?
Why don't I want to do this?
No, I really think I do.
That's fair.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
Track you down and --
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
I'll torture it out of you.
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
Do you not know what this is, then?
Would that I could.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
Maid or not, it fits you.
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
You've got sand, for a maid.
You have a name, missy?
Did you, now?
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
