Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Yeah?
What?!
Holy shit. That's all true?
Oh god. That's horrible.
No.
Yeah?
I hate 'em.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
