Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Am I getting warm?
Are you in trouble with the law?
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Miss, would I be prying?
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
You're OK?
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
