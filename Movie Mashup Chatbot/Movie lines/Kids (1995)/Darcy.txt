Do you care about me?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Nothing?
But I'm scared Telly.
How do you know?
I'm nervous.
I like you too.
Come on.
Uh huh.
Yes.
Yeah?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Tonight?
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
You were?
At the block party?
You have?
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
Hold on.
Right now?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Hey.
