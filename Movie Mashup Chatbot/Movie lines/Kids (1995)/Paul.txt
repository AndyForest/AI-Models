Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Hello.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
I don't know, eight or nine.
You want a wip-it?
What are you guys doing?
Hello?
Hello?
