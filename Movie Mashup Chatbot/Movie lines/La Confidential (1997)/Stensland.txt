It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
