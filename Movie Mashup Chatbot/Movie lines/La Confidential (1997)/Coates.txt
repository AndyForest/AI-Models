Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Say what?
I don't own no shotguns.
Man, what're you saying?
Dogs got no reason to live.
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Believed what?
I never truck with no sissies!
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Say what and so what.
