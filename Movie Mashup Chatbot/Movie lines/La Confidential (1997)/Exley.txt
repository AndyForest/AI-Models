You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
Bud...
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
Ellis Loew.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
You expecting problems?
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
What?
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
She told you?
Why?
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
How's it going to look on your report?
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
Just show me where they are!
Where are the police academy files?
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Anything?
Until he gunned down six people.
Clean?
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Did one of the officers work you over a little?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Something like that.
<u>No</u>.
And now you'll provide them.
Why?
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
I'll break them, sir.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Yes, I do, sir.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
His blood's always up.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
White's a mindless thug.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
No.
No.
No.
I... No.
Dudley, we've been over this.
You're wrong.
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
What?
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What's that for?
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
I want to do it right.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
It's a simple question.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
You make a mistake?
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
I want you to follow Bud White.
I need to speak to you.
Glasses.
Damnit...
L.A.P.D.
What about you?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
<u>Throwing me</u>?
That's right.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Decorated?
What's on the call sheet?
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
What are you talking about?
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
Not good enough.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
What's her name?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Bud White's been here?
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Where is he?
When?
Where will you go?
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
You, me and White, huh?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Why not?
Some reality.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
I'll take your word for it.
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
How about White?
You sound like you mean it.
How was I?
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
Why?
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
Really?  What did White say?
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
What's Dudley's scheme?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
None.  Call it a hunch.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Under the house.
Officer White?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
