Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
Against your code?
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Of course...
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
I don't know him.  Mr...
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
She's fine.
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
No.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Lynn Bracken.
A vulgar term, but yes.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
