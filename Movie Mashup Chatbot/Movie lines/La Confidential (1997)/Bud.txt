No.  Now.  You fucked him.
So tell me about it.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
How'd you get to know so much about him?
I want to know about Exley.
Did you talk to Exley?
That simple, huh?
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
Yeah.  But not for long.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
It's Bud.
Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
I don't know.
Look.  I want to see you again.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
I'm not sure.
When they deserve it.
Yeah.
You fuck for money.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Tell me about Patchett.
How'd she meet Patchett?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Are you sorry she's dead?
Yeah, plain scotch.
Somebody hit you?
That obvious, huh?
Merry Christmas.
Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
What work?
Give me one minute.
How'd you get them to retract?
Of course... But how?
Homicide?  A detective?
How?
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
<u>What do you want</u>?
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
Yeah, I hate them.
Dudley, what do you want?
Captain, what do you want?
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
This business, Captain?
What are you talking about?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
I got to write my report first.
You know him?
Yeah.  A great big one.
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
What's through here?
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
Look at a picture for me.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
What was that boyfriend's name?
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
Five minutes.  That's all.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine.
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
You wanted to meet here?
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
What about him?
<u>Lynn</u>.
At least not anymore.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
Which one are you and which one am I?
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
Let's just kill them.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
Dudley's guys.
Dudley.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Lynn.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Get the fuck away from me.
One in six.  Where's the girl?
What happened?
Yeah, that's Stens.
Where are we going?
I got her address.
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
What little studio?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
That's right.
No.
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
Thanks, but no thanks.
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Richard Stensland.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Are you Pierce Patchett?
I'm not asking you.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
More.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
Whose shoe?
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
