All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
