You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
How's the left these days?
No.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
Okay.  I'll do it.
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
What are you going to do?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
She is Lana Turner.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
So what's the point?
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
What?
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Yeah.  My whole life.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Give me a minute, will ya?
Just don't shoot me.
What?
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
You're the key witness?
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Shut up!
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Around.
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
And Reynolds?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
What's he doing here, Sid?
Sid, how are they hanging?
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Yeah, it's subtle.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Is she?
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
A bootleg...
I just called it.
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
It'll be our secret.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
Yeah.  Me neither.
Really?  How?
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Something like that.
Yeah.
Working whores with squad two.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
