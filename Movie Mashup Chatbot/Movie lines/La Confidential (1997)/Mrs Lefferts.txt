Was it... a rat?
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
No!  Please leave!
That's him.  That's him.
Maybe.  I don't know.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
My daughter was a virgin!
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
A sweet man.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
Let my Susie rest in peace!
At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
It seems like my Susan, but...
