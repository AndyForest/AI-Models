Yes.
Right.
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
I'm not running.
You don't understand this guy.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
What is he up to now?
Of course.
Of course.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
Good one!  Thanks.
And what did you say?
What did he ask?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
He's here!... He's here!
It's hurting.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
So, we'll...
I'm okay with that.
And the church.
Yes, you!
To who?  Are you asking me?
I love you, too.
Me, either.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Really?
About a minute...?
I kissed him back.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
Yes I do!
That's called changing your mind.
What!?
Lost!
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Brian told you that?
I already explained about that.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
It's fun!  It's high.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
You humiliated me!
Yes.
Excuse me?
Where did you disappear to?
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
No.  You take it.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
You know, there's no...
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
I'll have the same.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
You don't know.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
So?  Is that what you said to her?
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Still sweet.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Maybe someday.
I think so.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Six-fifty.
Seven-fifty.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
He is not!
Give me that!
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
We think so.
Without oxygen...
Twice...
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
You're going to be very disappointed.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
You have one?
Yes.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Excellent.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
What are you talking about?
No, I'm just going to head home.
I'm just finishing up, too.
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
Grandma!
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Lighten up, what?
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
But I'm weird.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
I'm going to kill myself.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Ya think?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
She's the boss.
Reporter?
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
No.  It's my life.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Thank you, Dad.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
