Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
His hair... any color.
"Never say die."
"Make the shot."
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
No, she's talking about your hair.
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
And you are?
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
Are you a reporter?
Quick.  Very quick.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Okay.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
You okay?  I'm closing.
Let's go.
Not eight...
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
It's for the bell.
What happened at the luau?
He's going to be the pastor?
Would it?
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Lighten up, wahine.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
Why?
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Yes.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Where?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
It's probably because you got him fired.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Yup!
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
You're a goddess!
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Yeah.
No.
No, you tell her.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
