Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
God bless you, Maggie.
It happens to be how I feel.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
