Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Or a vegetarian?
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
I have no idea what I'm doing.

It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
All the gory details.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
In vino veritas.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
