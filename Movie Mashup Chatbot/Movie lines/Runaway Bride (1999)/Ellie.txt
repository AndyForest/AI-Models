Where do you think she's going?
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
No.  No, you didn't.
Fisher, let him talk.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
I already made an appointment for later today.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
-- It's for you, Ike.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Poor Ike.
Look, he's running after her.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
