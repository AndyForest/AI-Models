Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Like her mother.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
A harmless joke.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
What?
I'm really rooting for this one.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
Good boy, Port Hole.
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
