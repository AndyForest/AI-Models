Got any last minute advice?
Really?
Thank you.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
You bet ya, Coach.
Ahh.
Maggie!
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
What?
So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Then you'll be my best man.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Okay, we'll order out.
Yeah.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
I don't know.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Oh, please!
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Thanks.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
No, I'm not.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
It's nice that they're still friends.
That must have made you proud.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
I think you'd look good in red.
Looking for Maggie.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
About her upcoming wedding and all.
What?
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
Thank you.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
You know, your daughter seems...
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
They made me put my hat back on.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
I'm listening.
You were not.
This is getting serious.
Used?
Yes, I did.
Does it matter?
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
So am I.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
Well, you do have the dress.
Me?
I love you.  I love you.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
A little longer for me.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
I'd rather not.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
I don't and I don't think you should...
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
Missed me bad, huh?
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Kind of isolated.
Of what?
Can you fix it?
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Of course.
Bob will be very happy.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Agreed.
No.
I don't know.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
I'm a work in progress.
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
Highly suspect.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
Always a mood killer.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
You afraid to try?
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Cindy the manicurist.
Done.
Five hundred.
Too much.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Really.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
You can turn that finger around.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
A pre-wedding luau?
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
How romantic.
Really?
Everest.  Is that right?
That's fair.
We'll see.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
Getting nervous?
You'll answer my questions?
Originality is my speciality.
