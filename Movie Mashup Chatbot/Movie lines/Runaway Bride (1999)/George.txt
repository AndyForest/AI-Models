Unbelievable, she got to you.
And you defending her?
Why do YOU think she ran?
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
