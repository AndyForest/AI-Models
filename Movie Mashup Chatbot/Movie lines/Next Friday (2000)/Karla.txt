You alright?
Next time, page me first.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
It's locked.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
You did all this for me?
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
What are you doing here?
Better sooner than later.
I just wanted to give you this.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Hello, remember me?
I don't know.
My brothers won't give me a ride.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Karla.
'Take your car?'
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Hey, what's going on?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
