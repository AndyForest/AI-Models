Smokin' what?
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
I saw it.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
Craig, remember what I told you.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Just hold your breath.
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
What it smell like?
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Well bring yo' ass on...
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
What's the matter?
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
Need to lose some weight.
I got my mase.
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
