Hey, how you get out of here.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Ezal!  Ezal!
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
What?
Keep pushing.
William.
Just do it.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
Get on!
Get on.
Rancho Cucamonga?
What you say?
Where did Craig move to?
