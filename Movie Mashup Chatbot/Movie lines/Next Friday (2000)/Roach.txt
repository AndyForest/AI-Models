Fuck, what's his name?
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
What about the dog?
Me neither.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
You know what he mean, dude.
Great moves, Day-Day.
I'll do it.
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
He's a boy, dude.
Bite his ear!
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
I don't know.
Hey.
And some rolling papers.
This is a knock.
Go for it.
Why did he go in the house?
Where's Craig?
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
I know.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
You could sell your Beamer.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Sorry, dude.
I do.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
Negative...they vamped.
You don't wanna know.
That the big one, huh?
What is it?
What it say?
What up, bro?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
