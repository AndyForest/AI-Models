And I can go free?
That's it?
Anything you need.
I will.  When can I come visit?
You sure you don't wanna stay?
What about me?
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
What you see?
Wait for what?
I hope to God that dog is happy.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
No.
Naw, you go first.
You make it sound so easy.
The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
How you know?  It could be anything.
Yeah, air.
I didn't see nothing.
Alright, Roach, see you around.
What we gonna do?
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
Out the door and to the left.
It works.
Blow.
Ain't no windows in here.
I don't.
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
You already in.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
$247.
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
How can they do this?
You know what this is?
You walked?
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.
So.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
That's the sister.
You don't know Baby D.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
I can't taste nothing.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
Call me.
Thanks for the help.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Get 'em, Craig!
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
What?!  What that mean?
Ya'll live around here?
...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing.  How y'all doing?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
You wanna knock?
Don't worry about it.  We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.
He's inside the house?
Roach...Roach, come on.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Let it go!
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
Roach, what are you doing?
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Today ain't my day.
Are they still out there?
What was that?
You damn right that's the big one.
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
Where's Craig?
I know.  I'm sorry.
I got fired too.
20 minutes?
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Nothing.
