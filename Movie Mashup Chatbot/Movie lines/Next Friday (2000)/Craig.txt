Stretch it out.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Yup.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
I don't know!
Why you say that?
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
Y'all never use it?
It's cool, but where's the water?
You paid cash?
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Yeah.
Thanks, Unc.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Where you going?
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Yes you did.
I'm his cousin.
Cheeco.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
It's about to work, just come on.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Black magic.
Naw, I already ate.
What's the green stuff poking out?
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Not me.
I'm gone.
What you mean talk to her?
What happen?
No I'm not.
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
Nobody!
Man, Day-Day is my people!
I ain't trying to rob you...
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
You're welcome, Unc.
No, man, just wait.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
Wait.
Me too.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
You go first.
You go first.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
What's the B-G's?
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
You see that?
Sorry about today, man.
I don't know yet.
Nothing.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Still gonna smell it.
That ain't gonna work.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
You better stop running from that girl.
I ain't trying to get in it.
What's the matter?
Okay, plan B.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.
I walked.
What you mean, so?
Why?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
Who is that?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Damn, you got a stalker.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
What?
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Just a little.
You straight?
I know, be still.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
Thanks for reminding me.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Man, this a cool house.
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
This you?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Who is that?
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
What's crackin'?
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Okay.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Make sure.
I did.  Is that door locked?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
Huh?
Most definitely.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.
You want us to give you a ride?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
What is it?
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
I don't play for no team.
Can I help you?
I said hold on!
Hold on.
Nothing.
You too.
Yeah, pops!
Come on.
You see that?
Have you seen Day-Day?
I'll remember.
Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
You coming in?
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
It's alright.
All damn.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
I do.
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
What's the matter?
Here I come!
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Nice to meet you?
What kind of activity?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
Excuse me?
