Don't move me.
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
No.  Thought he was with you.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Suga!
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Good.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
Well, let me in.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
I don't know.
Sorry, my ass.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
What?!
Ah damn.  Damn.
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
My back.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Shut yo' ass up.
What about that ugly dog?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
I threw my back, again.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
What you doing to my nephew?
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
