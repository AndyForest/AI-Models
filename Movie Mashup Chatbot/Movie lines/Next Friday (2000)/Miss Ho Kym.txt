Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Peace out, Craig.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
