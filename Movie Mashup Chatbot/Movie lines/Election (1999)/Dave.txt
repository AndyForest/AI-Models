I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.

Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
