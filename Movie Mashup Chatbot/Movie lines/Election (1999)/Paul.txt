Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
I also like bananas.
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
And she's super-nice
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
What do you mean?
Yeah.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
For what?
For what?
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Sure, Tracy.
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Thanks!
Hell, good luck!
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
What do you mean?
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
What'd I do?
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
