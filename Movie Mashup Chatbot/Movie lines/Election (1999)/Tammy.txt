I have proof.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Door was open.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
This weekend.
I did it.
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
I don't care.
I know.
So?
What?
What...?
Where 're you going?
What?
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Now could you leave me alone?
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
What do you want?
You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.
You dumbshit!
Paul, get out!
Don't you fucking knock?
