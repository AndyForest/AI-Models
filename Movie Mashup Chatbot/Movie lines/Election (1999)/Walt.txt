Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Larry, you just take it easy
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
If you say so.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
