Great!
Good.
So do you.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Tom's gone.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Sure.
Who is it?
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
Why should they?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Who's going to want me now?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
My period.
I said... I started.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Well, now you know what it feels like.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Yeah, you know everything!!
Tom?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
About what?
Nothing.
I'll take care of it.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
I'll come.
Why? There's no food in the house?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Did he mention it?
Did you ask him to come visit?
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
I think they call it a pasture.
I didn't see it.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Little.
No, you just act like you do.
Then why do you want to leave?
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
What?
You were never thirteen, Mom.
I don't care.
I didn't know I had to.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Fine.
Whatever you want.
I don't care.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
Maybe they should put me down too.
Mom?
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
What about him?
Doesn't matter.
No, you didn't.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Fine!
Is that your version of a pep talk?
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
Okay.
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
You know, you're a good kid.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Of course I have.
Would you let me ride your horse?
Why do you always wear that hat?
Don't you go to school?
No!
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
I want to watch.
What does that mean?
Sure.
I can't... not yet...
I know where he goes.
Are you afraid of anything?
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I don't know if I can.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
I can't...
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
That's not a question, is it?
Isn't it like, obvious?
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
She's an editor.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Yeah?
Jude, you okay?
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Do you want to go around by the old road?
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
So?
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
Did you notice -- no cane?
I want to see Pilgrim.
NO!
Maybe... look -- just...
No, I'm just not that hungry.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
How's Pilgrim doing?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
