Honey... I was always good.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Long enough.
What are you looking at, young man?
The number's by the phone.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Hey, darlin'.
