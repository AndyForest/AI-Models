I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
You want to take a walk with me?
Was the trip okay?
Tubab means white man.
No. I am a "tubab."
Yes?
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
Take your time.
May I have a suggestion?
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
How are you feeling about work?
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
I wish I did.
Huh-huh. You?
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Good night.
I miss you, Annie.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
When are you coming home?
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
What if she doesn't want to go?
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
I'm not pretending anything!
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
You've already made arrangements!?
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
What was I saying?
What did he say?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
Doing what?
I love you.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
How's my pregnant chick!
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
The funeral's on Friday.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
No, let me go.
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
I'm sorry.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Okay. We'll see you later then.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Riding with Judith.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
Hi.
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
I know. Amazing.
What, sweetheart?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
You want to watch some television?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
OK, OK.
No, not yet.
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
I understand...
How much longer do you think?
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
