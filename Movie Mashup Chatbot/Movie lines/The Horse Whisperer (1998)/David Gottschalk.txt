If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Who's there?
