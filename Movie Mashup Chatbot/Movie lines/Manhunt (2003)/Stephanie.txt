Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
Yeah.
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
I had it all on tape...
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
No.  A witness.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
You'll find out - soon enough.
No.
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
Mind if I turn out the light?
You're the mysterious type, right?
You got any family?
Where up north?
So where are you from?
