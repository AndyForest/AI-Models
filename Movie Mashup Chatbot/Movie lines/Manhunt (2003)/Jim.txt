It wasn't in the cards.
I'll live...
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
She stole my car!!
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
And who are you?
No -
Where the hell is my car?
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
What happened with the tape?
What did you do then?
Found what?
And what did you do?
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
No, but I'm listening.
What exactly did you see?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
Why did you set me up?
What's going on here?
Only on dates?
You always carry a gun with you?
Figure you would have tried it already.
No...
No...
Seattle.
Up north.
Are you going to be alright?
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Both at the same bank...
A bank?
What else is new?
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
How about Marvosa and the others?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
I knew I could count on you.
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
1490...Breckinridge...
I've got a better idea...
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
I killed them.
No...
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Please...
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
Yeah...
No...I'm in some trouble...
Tubbs, it's me.
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
You don't seem afraid of much.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
Ditched you?
Are you a regular there?
Hop in.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Where am I going?
No.  It wasn't like that!
What?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
