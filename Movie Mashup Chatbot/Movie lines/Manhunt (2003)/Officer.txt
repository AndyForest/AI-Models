LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
Captain?
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
