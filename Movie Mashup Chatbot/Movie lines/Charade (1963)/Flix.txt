The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Forty-five thousand.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
The money is unimportant.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
