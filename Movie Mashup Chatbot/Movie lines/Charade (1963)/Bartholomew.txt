The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
That's the spirit.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Cafï¿½.
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
That's not Carson Dyle.
No.
Describe him.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Who?
Agents.
Were you followed?
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Because they're still here.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
I believe you.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Ours.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Only we call them agents.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
