Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Then say it.
I said, tell me to go to the --
All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
You lied to me so many times --
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
No!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
I'm through listening to you!
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Now what?
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- �lys�es! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
Of course there is!
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
I love you, Adam.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Lord, you're stubborn.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Why?
What is it?
Adam --
You're going to look for him -- now?
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
Well -- come on.
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
You don't look so bad in this light.
Adam!
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
What about it?
What?
No -- I guess not.
Oh!
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
I could eat a horse.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Are you sure there's no mistake?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Yes -- ?
Agents.
Me? Why me?
Oh. Then who's this one?
But no one actually saw him die.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
May I have a cigarette, please?
Steal it how?
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Gratin�e, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Barely, yes.
Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
Carson?
No, what?
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Oh.
Why not?
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
But --
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Thanks very much.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
But I don't have it.
Oh, I see.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job!
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Very sweet.
His -- real -- ?
So that was it.
May I have a sandwich, please?
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Agent.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
We? You mean you're --?
You mean spies and things like that?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
No thanks.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
You'd lie about anything.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
Oh.
But you're -- divorced?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
What's your first name today?
Starting with his own.
Bartholomew?
Then how do I know this is your office?
Around one.
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
I don't believe it.
You mean, you're a thief?
What do you mean?
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
Go on.
Well!
Fiction or non-fiction?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
It's a start, anyway.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
I don't believe it.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
Shut the door!
What are you doing?
I dare you.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
The shower's in there.
Got you.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
No --
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
I'm scared.
Alex --
I'm sorry.
No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
What's so illogical about that?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
I think Tex did it.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Or Tex?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
No.
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
What day is it?
I'll be right there.
They've got Jean-Louis!
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
I think I love you, Alex --
Oh.
You did.
Cutting it out.
Okay.
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
Said what?
Why can't you be serious?
I'm not fifteen.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Come here.
Which one are you?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
There must be some way.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
There -- you're a new man.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Sure.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Does it hurt?
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Scobie?
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
Your --
Carson Dyle is dead.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Why you lied to me.
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
Please keep it.
Here's ten.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur F�lix -- are they for sale now?
And the last one?
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
In money.
What's its value today?
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
I'm afraid it is important.
How much is it worth?
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
Yes.
Monsieur F�lix -- ?
But his mother --
Stop it!
Leave me alone -- !
I don't know anything.
Tell me what?
What do you want?
No -- in my room.
I was, too.
I don't understand.
Of course it is.
Is that all? Can I go now?
Did you?
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
A letter? May I see it?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
I wish you wouldn't.
I know.  I'm sorry.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know. I suppose so.
He didn't have one.
Swiss.
I'm very confused.
Leave?
I'm very cold.
Yes.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur F�lix lives?
Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
No, Jean-Louis.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
Voil� what?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
What should we give him?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Don't put yourself out.
Words can hurt very much.
What are you talking about?
How do you know what they're doing?
I believe what he said.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
Yes -- that's right.
The man you had the fight with.
Do you tell lies?
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
That's all.
A quarter of a million dollars.
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
Be careful, Peter.
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
Peter -- are you all right?
Nothing. Good night.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
How about once more around the park?
Where?
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
What was what?
How do you shave in there?
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Having a nervous breakdown.
Lay on, MacDuff.
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
Starting tonight?
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
The man and the woman are married --
Don't you understand French?
I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
Hallo, Peter.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
I don't know where to go.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Thank you.
How did you find out?
What are you doing here?
Charles is.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
How do you know?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Now you're angry.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Yes.
I'm Regina Lampert.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Quitter.
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Why, do you think we're going to?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
Please stop -- please!
Stop that!
No -- no, I'm don't.
Wha -- what do you want?
I don't understa--
Yes?
I don't see him.
A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
I'm glad. But what's all this?
What's he up to?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
The American Embassy.
How can you tell?
I've never seen him before.
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Don't you want me to stay?
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Because I don't love him.
I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
