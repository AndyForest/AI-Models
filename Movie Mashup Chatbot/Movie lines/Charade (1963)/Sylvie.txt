We will separate -- you look over there.
What?
What's the matter, ch�rie?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Oh la vache!
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
What is it about?
Who is it from?
He's allergic to him.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Do you know him?

At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
He knows everything.
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
But why do you want a divorce?
But what?
�a alors! From Charles?
Va jouer, mon ange.
