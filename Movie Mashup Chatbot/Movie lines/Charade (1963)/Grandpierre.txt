It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
And this? And this?
And this?
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysï¿½es"  Why there?
Is it all right?
It is all right.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
Where did he keep his money?
About how wealthy would you say?
He was a wealthy man?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He was American?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
You loved him?
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
