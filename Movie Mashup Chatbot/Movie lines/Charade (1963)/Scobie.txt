He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?

Me?
Then who does?
That's the idea.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Keep going.
Open it.
Okay -- up there.
I said with the mouth shut.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
We want that money -- now!
Who invited you?
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
Yeah? What's that?
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
