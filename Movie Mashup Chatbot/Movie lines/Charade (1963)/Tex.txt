First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
The kid said --
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
And if it is?
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Shoot no, not after all these years.
He took care of Charlie for us.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
