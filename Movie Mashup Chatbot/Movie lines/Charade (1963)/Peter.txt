Good night.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
What'd he say?
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
Who is it?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
So they think he left it with you.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Go on.
What?
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Good night.
What?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
How would you like a spanking?
On the street where you live.
We're here.
Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
What your husband was mixed up in.
What was it?
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
I wasn't --
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Who said?
I don't think I follow you.
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
What are you doing in here?
En garde.
You mean you and me?
What was all that?
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
Of course? I thought he was dead.
I'm still having trouble with English.
What's going on?
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
We'll find you a hotel.
Come on. You can't stay here.
Instant divorce you mean?
Doing what?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Where did everything go?
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
Are you in the book?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Shakespeare never said that.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Is your husband with you?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Oh. I guess.
I'm not sure I --
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Please, not on my account.
Good for you.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Peter Joshua.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
How's that?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list
I don't know -- how would I know?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
