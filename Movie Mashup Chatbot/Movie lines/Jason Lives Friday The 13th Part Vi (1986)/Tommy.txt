Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
I hope so.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Come and get it.
'Cause it stinks.
No.
So what are ya drawin'?
It's just beginning.
Okay.  There's one.
Uh...yes.  But...
What?
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Doesn't that tell you something?!
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Please don't do anything crazy.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
Yes!
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Why didn't you cremate him?!
There's no time for this bullshit...
Yes, but they released me because...
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
Will you listen, dammit!
