Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
We'll scare 'em right back.
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
That's debatable.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
Where'd you get this?
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
You mean you had a bad dream.
So what happened?
What's goin' on?
He didn't say anything?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
You gotta be kidding!
Which is?
So where's Cort gone off to?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
