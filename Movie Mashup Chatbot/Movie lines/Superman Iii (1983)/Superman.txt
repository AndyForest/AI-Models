Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Thanks.  Let's go
Just a second.
No...I just have a little stop to make.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
No, we're just going down.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
How you doing down there?
The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
There's no rush.
You just did, with that great dinner.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
We've already met.
Anytime.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
I don't know you, lady.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Tell me.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
