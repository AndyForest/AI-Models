The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
I seem to be.
Brad Wilson.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Uh-huh.
Can I help?
Call me.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Old ties are hard to cut.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
Me neither...
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
No, thanks.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
There's a lot of choices here.
Me??
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
You thought that?
Oh...I came close once.
Who?
But Lana, you could --
I didn't --
Too much mayonnaise?
It sure is.
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
You're welcome...??
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Oh. You're going away.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Sure.
We get together sometimes.
What!
Well...  Not quite like this.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
You're the best, Lois.
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
What are you doing?
At one o'clock in the morning?
What's that?
Mmmmm . . .
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
