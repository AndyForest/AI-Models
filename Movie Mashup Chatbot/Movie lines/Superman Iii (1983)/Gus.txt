Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?

Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Buddy, are we in trouble.
What about this week's check?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
I know, I'm the fault.
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Thirty-five.
Nope, but --
Kitchen. . . Technician

Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
One.  And a half.
So where is all them half-centses?
Who gets it, the company?

Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Stone mutha.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Yeah? How's it look?
Anything.
Everything.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
A computer.
Fair's fair.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Now...when do I get a taste?
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
They ain't got captains?
Huh?
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Turn on the T.V.
Hey, boss.
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
First question got to be "Where."
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
How do you do that?
That what they call you?
Me? How?
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
Wipe 'em out?

Decaffeinated too?
Man, what is this?
Black or regular?
I'm tryin' to.
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Or socks.
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Uh...
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
We back in Metropolis?
We gonna crash?
Watch out for them air pockets!
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
