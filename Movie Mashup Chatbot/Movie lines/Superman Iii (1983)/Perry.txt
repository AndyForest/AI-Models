Kent!
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
What about you?
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.

You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
Who's the other woman?
Who is she?
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
The picture looks blurry.
Where's the handle?
Why do I have to do this?
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Okay? Goodbye.
53.
