Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
All right. Fine.
Assuming we are in agreement?
You're an extraordinary man.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Ahh.
Perhaps some tea?
Will you have a glass of sherry?
