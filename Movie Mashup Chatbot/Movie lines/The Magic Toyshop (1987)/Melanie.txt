Everything is gone, now.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
I already lost everything once.
How long has -
Surely she is older?
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Do you think we should take her up to bed?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
Finn ...
Stop it!
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
You did what?
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
Finn -
Well ... yes. All right. But -

Do what?  Oh, I see.
What did I do wrong?

I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
A sin against <i>what?</i>
I did like the music.
I like plaits.
He's a pyjama case, really.
I can manage.
There's no mirror.
But you're Irish!
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
It's all right, Finn.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Victoria -
I'm Melanie.
