I said you were a loser!
George...
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
Yes, yes, I did.
Stop it.
George, now cut this out.
Please!... that's not like you.
George...
-- yes.
I wish you'd go now.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
... well I'm glad you told me.
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
I just want to know, that's all.
How many?
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
-- and take this with you.
I'd like you to leave now.
Yes.
Yes.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Let go of me.
I'm very tired, George.
What is.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Bullshit.
I don't want to fight, George.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
-- go ahead.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Commercials.
Ha, ha.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
I know, honey.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
What business meeting?
Never mind. Where've you been?
A friend dropped me off.
... Okay...
What?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
When is that, George?
When is that?
When?
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
I want your feelings about it.
Your advice!
No, but I think they might.
Egypt.
Whether or not I'm going.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
When can I talk to you?
George.
I already said hello.
George.
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Egypt!
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Could I?
Could I talk to you for a second?
How did it go at the bank?
Hello.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
George.
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
George?
Yeah.
You've never even been around one.
Maybe you don't even like children.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Will we live together?
Why am I great?
Honey?
Do you really mean that?
I am?
I am?
What about me?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
Honey, what happened?
How?
What?
Fine. How are you?
Now, George --
George --
George, I don't --
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
I just... who what?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Here in the canyon.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
There were some shots.
Somebody's mother.
I was too old.
A daytime soap opera.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
What did you do?
Didn't you have any panties on?
... Mmm-hmmm.
-- uhh-huhh...
-- Yesss?
C'mon.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
Honey?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
Jackie --
I'm exaggerating.
Well, you know what I mean.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
But you have problems?
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Well, it's George.
Nothing.
-- No. No really.
Don't be silly.
I guess not.
George is great but I know what you mean.
I know, I'm sorry.
So what's your point?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I am? I mean why?
Who is that?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
You're kidding.
You're going?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
-- why?
Let's do that.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
That bastard.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
George? Was he alone?
Well... sure...
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
He's a hairdresser.
-- no.
-- never mind.
Johnny!
Sort of.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Oh. thank you.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
But why Egypt?
Egypt?
Thank you.
-- yes, Jill.
Jill.
-- there's not much room --
-- I'll get in the back --
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
No!
No.
No.
No.
No, it's not that...
No... how long did you say?
