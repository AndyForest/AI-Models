I don't know -- I've got to.
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
I can't just let him stand by the door...
God, there's Lester...
What?
What's that supposed to mean?
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
It's too late...
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
Well then what are you trying to do-
You're going to kill me.
That's it, then I'm leaving.
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Lester's on his way.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
-- you've got to leave.
-- well you better go after her.
Why?
-- we are?
What's wrong?
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Me?
-- ass and legs --
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
-- very nice, very nice.
Nothing.
-- oh I thought you were --
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
We're friends.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
He still having parties?
Where do you want to go?
I am you, you little bastard.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
You don't think so? I do.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
I don't know what gets into me.
-- gee...
Fuckin' A --
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
-- don't you want to --
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
What about it?
He's a director.
-- what guy?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
What are you talking about?
Don't, don't, don't...
It'll ruin everything.
No! Don't! Please!
You're a genius.
George...
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
You did, I know you did.
You did, didn't you?
Well, did you or didn't you?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
You know what I'm talking about.
Did you?
George... how about Felicia?
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
George...
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
It was after you, baby. After you.
And what?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
No.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
The shrink? Many times.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
What's wrong?
... I don't get it done often.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Jill's coming with us.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
You don't seem very sure.
You would?
Well, what do you think?
Can't you do it out here?
Where do you want to do this?
Well, I do.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
-- Well no. It never came up.
He's a very private person, actually.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Jesus...
So how's Norman?
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
You do?
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
-- you phony asshole --
Jackie Shawn.
You know what's wrong.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Because I don't want one.
No.
Here.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Shut the door, shut the door!
Fine.
You're still jealous.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
You and your touchy investors.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
That's not very logical, Lester.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Steve?
Who do you think I was talking to?
I am?
No kidding? Your own shop?
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Anyway, you're crazy.
Fine.
That's right.
Poster-Kleiser.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Hi, Leonard.
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
-- He reached up and tore them.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Well, there was this one time --
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
What?
I would say so, yes.
It's been so long I don't how long?
He does?
What?
How much?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Five times a day?
-- Yeah, honey...
We don't think marriage is important.
I thought you said things were great with George.
It must be something.
Well, what is it, honey?
You're really a love -- you sure?
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Well, he is.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
