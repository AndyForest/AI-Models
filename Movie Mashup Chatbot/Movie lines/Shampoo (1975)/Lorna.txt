Yeah.
Yeah.
I am not!
I am not!
I am not like my mother!
Then what do you think?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
You think that's funny, don't you?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
I never get my hair done.
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
Don't make conversation with me.
Why?
Making it with my mother?
Well, are you?
I asked you first.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
Did you hear me?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Chopped liver?
You're my mother's hairdresser?
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
Hungry?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
You here to see my mother?
