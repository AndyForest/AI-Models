If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
Wanda...
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
