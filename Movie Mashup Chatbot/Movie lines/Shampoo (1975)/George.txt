Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
No, it's a very groovy girl.
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Chicken salad, Devra!
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
She's a friend of Jill's.
Well she...
But aren't you...
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Hi.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
I know.
No, I know.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
-- Anyway.
I don't know. Just a minute...
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
What about?
Your husband?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
Whatever you say.
You're looking great, baby.
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
What kind of treatment?
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
I don't want to place you in any position --
What?
-- What?
Calm down, baby.
But you don't know what happened.
I gotta talk to you.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I'll be back in a while.
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
Wow.
She did?
I know.
I don't know.
Yeah, I think so.
She's got a...
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
My keys.
No.
Right now?
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
You are.
You are.
That you're just like your mother.
No.
Yeah...
Yeah.
No shit.
No kidding.
Yeah, it is.
What?
... just, you could look very heavy...
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Am I what?
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Have you ever made it with a girl?
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Gee, this is great.
... yeah.
Yeah.
No thanks.
No thanks.
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
A little.
Yeah.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
I guess not...
They are?
Well, yeah... you know.
Right, that's right.
Right.
Great.
She is.
Great.
Right.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Oh fuck, Norman!
I've got heads here, Norman.
Buffums?
Yeah.
What for?
Don't leave me...
Don't go, Jackie...
I don't know... Jackie?
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
So I'm saying it...
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
No --
-- It's Malone's.
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Look about last night --
Where are you going?
Why?
I've got to leave?
-- good afternoon --
-- Jesus --
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- do you want ice?
Not me, pal.
-- yes, you --
Look who's talking.
Mmmm --
-- mmm --
-- what?
-- where'd you go?
-- sure.
Am I entertaining you?
-- yeah.
What are you looking at?
He never stopped.
Sammy's?
That sounds like me.
You were great.
No you didn't.
You were great.
-- what?
-- you are.
Jackie, can we --
-- we can't now.
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
Don't do it.
You don't do that anymore, do you?
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've --
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
-- this guy with Jill.
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
Look, either come in or stay out!
Sit down!
Sit down.
I know... you don't know, I know.
I don't want to... I swear...
Yeah, baby...
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Baby...
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Yeah?
Hey, I don't tell.
Did I what?
What?
I won't screw you up.
I just have to do one little thing.
Did Lester know about him?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Did you?
And?
Why not?
Why not?
Do you? You still see him?
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Yeah... wow.
It's hot in here.
Whew.
Yeah... I mean great.
Great.
Okay.
No, I'm sure.
Yeah, I think so...
I'd cut it...
Probably the bathroom.
No, thanks.
You going to tell him?
Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
I'm sure.
How long you had this?
Great... so how's everything with you?
I don't know. Probably not.
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
I'm busy, man.
Yeah?...
Oh yeah?
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
What?
No, man.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- how did you get here?
-- why did you come in today?
-- please, please forgive me...
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- Otis?
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
I don't know if you don't know --
-- White ladies?
-- Oh yeah.
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
Wash her.
Okay... thanks...
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
-- yeah, this is --
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Hey, stop by the shop.
That's too bad.
What did you say?
What did you say?
What did you say?
Did you?
Did you?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Did you?
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
That's all you've got to say?
Does it make you happy?
What? What? What? What? What?
Jesus.
How?
-- please, baby --
Baby, don't do this --
Baby, please don't... I love you.
What difference does it make?
What do you wanna know for?
Obviously.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Where did this come from?
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
That was him.
Oh, Christ.
Didn't you, baby?
You did fuck him, didn't you?
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
Well that's something.
How come you took your own car?
I do, Jill.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
-- well aren't you --
I've got to get her out of here.
Now, Jackie --
Television or movies?
What does he direct besides traffic?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Look at the way I live.
A business meeting, I told you that.
Who?
Where's your car?
Jill says nothing.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Neither do I, baby.
I'll call you.
I'll call you.
When I get off work.
Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
Right now?
They didn't offer you the job yet.
What do you want?
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
Honey, have they offered you the job?
Going where?
About what?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Yeah, baby.
Okay.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
Great... can we talk later?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Go where?
Yeah.
Hey, I'm, you know --
Great.
Yeah, baby...
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Great.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Okay, baby. Okay...
What!
Okay...  Night, baby.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Of course I like children.
-- Sure.
We live together now.
Yeah, baby.
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
Yeah.
You're great.
You're different.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
How are you, baby?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Keep moving --
You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
No shit?
You said somebody... who?
Who?
What?
Well, like what?
What's gonna happen?
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Where?
What're you talking about?
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
Said what!
You need a cut.
No.
What're you here for?
What?
Yes I do.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
No --
Lester, it just happened.
What about her?
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
Oh yeah...
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Who?
I know.
Okay, thanks.
No thanks.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
Didn't they tell you?
What, do you think I planned it?
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
I'm not anti-Establishment.
What can I say!
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
Oh Jesus Christ.
But...
Now wait a minute...
Well, what?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Well... who are those guys?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
This really ought to be layered...
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Well anyway...
-- yeah?
I don't know what to...
Oh, hey...
... this doing hair it's...
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
... she's very upset...
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
I know what you mean.
Oh yeah?
Okay.
Tonight?
When?
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Oh yeah.
Sure.
You're right.
They're not?
Thank you.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
I'm better than the guy I work for.
In a way. But...
Yes it is.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
Thank you.
Well, yeah.
