I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- he'll never know the difference.
What's wrong?
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
You're going.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Of course not.
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
-- oh I don't know --
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
I don't think so.
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
Not with your hairdresser.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Good for you.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
I'm terribly sorry.
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Is he an enemy?
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Sure.
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
That's right.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Where to, Les?
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Everybody but us.
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
