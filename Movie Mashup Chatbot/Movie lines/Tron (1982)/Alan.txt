Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Your old files -- ?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Hi, Flynn.
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Dillinger?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Senior exec.
You invented Space Paranoids?
I don't get it.
Are you embezzling?
You did break in.
I'm certainly not.
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
What -- ?
For what?
Of what?
What for?
You call that getting over it?
Okay, okay...
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
They'll start to soon enough.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Beautiful!
Ok
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
Yeah...?
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
