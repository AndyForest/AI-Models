Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
I know, I met him.
Want one?
My dinner.
Hi, Alan.
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
You haven't told him?
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Let's get outta here.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
This town's full o' live ones.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
Way to go! We're haulin'!
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
I'm your program?
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
Oh. Anything else?
That all you can say?
What do you mean, "'yes"?
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
Hey... you guys OK?
Did we make it?
Not us, I hope.
What about our friend - Sark?
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
Yeah, I... oops!
Greetings, program...
How about over there...that empty memory?
What's that?
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
Well, isn't it -- ?
Alan!
Shhhhh.
Probably.
Jump.
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Let's get some power here.
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
There's another beam!
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
What's wrong with that area?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Hey... !
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
What's goin' on?
Feel what? You okay?
It grows on you.
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Watch it!
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Tron...?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
So...how's the world of serious science?
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
