We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
Wait...I need that...
But-what if I can't...?
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
A User?
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
Yes, MCP.
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Thank. you, Master Control.
