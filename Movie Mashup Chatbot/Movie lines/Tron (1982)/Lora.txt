I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Flynn!
For being on to Dillinger.
That Dillinger's on to him.
To warn him.
I mean I want both of us to go.
I want to go to his place.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Did he say why?
Did you say Group 7 access?
How's it going upstairs?
You're getting out of the business?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
We have to talk.
