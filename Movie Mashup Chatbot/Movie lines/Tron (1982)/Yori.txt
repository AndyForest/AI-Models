Flynn... you can't... I
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Why? What are you going to do?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
How did you do that, Flynn?
It's too far!
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
A User -- in our world?
It's something Users do.
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Then I owe you some thanks...
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
You've grown, big program.
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
My quarters.
How?
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
