Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
Come on in...
You wouldn't dare.
If you think -
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
The Pentagon?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
I'm sorry -
Cute.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Meanwhile, he might find it.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Flynn?
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
It can be arranged...
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
