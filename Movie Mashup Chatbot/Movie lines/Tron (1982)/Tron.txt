Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Dumont!
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?

I... have come to communicate with my User.

We have to.
Do it!

Where's Flynn?
Nice...
We have to get off this beam!
What is it?
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
As long as it gets us out of here

Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
