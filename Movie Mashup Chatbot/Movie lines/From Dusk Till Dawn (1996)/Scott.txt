Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.

You could take their head off.
Yeah, it's mine.
Okay, I'll have one.
