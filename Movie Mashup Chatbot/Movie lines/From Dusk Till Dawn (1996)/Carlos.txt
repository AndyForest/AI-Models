Vamanos!
Yeah, follow us.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
You like the car?
Twenty-eight.
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
