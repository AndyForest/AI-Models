Everybody goes home!
I'm going for 'em!
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I promise.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?

Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
It's a flop house.
What do you think Mom would say?
That happens, you'll get it back.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.

It's the bitterest of pills.
What did I say?
Do what?
What?
What's in Mexico?
Where are you taking us?
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What's going on?
Later.
Me too.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
Not many.
Watch my back!
Noooo!
We have to go back for Daddy!
I'm really sorry.
Are you okay?
Okay.
You're gonna let us go?
Yeah, we got a bible.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Creepy guy.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
