You asked me if I would --
What you said to me in the room.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Mexicans.
Mexico.
What?
Sure.
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
How are you?
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Yeah.
It don't look together.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
Where are you?
Where are you right now?
You're lookin' green.
You know what you look like?
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you think?
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
We are?
What?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
Really?
I did?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
Or what?
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
What does that mean?
They're gonna search the van.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
This isn't gonna work.
What?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yes.
Seth, if you were me --
What?
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
She's in the other room.
What?
How do you know?
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
Didya look at the border?
What'd ya see?
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
All I'm saying --
Did you even to try to negotiate?
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
Feels good.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
Do they have a waterbed?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Do they have cable?
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Gotcha!
Yeah?
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
You believe me don't cha?
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
He signaled the Ranger.
