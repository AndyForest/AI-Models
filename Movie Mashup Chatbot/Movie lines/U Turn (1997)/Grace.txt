<u>Jake</u>...
And I love you too.
Why's that?
Can you make it back up?
Bobby? Are you all right?
Hope is a four-letter word.
My mother died in this canyon.
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
<u>I don't know why</u>!
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
So, aren't you going to ask me?
He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
What are you talking about?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
Anywhere?
But I thought --
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
I'm not coming back.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
The money's right here! Get the key!
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Because I know you're full of shit.
Stop it.
There is no us, remember?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Kill him.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
Is it pretty?
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
You'd never understand.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Nothing.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
I don't know how.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
No.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
How do you know he's still not here?
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You never did answer my question.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
And what would that be?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Beautiful?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Lift me down.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Come here.
Those are white words, not ours.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
I guess it must.
Thank you.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
What happens when you lose?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Where you headed?
You've been around.
Where you coming from?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Drove into Superior?  What for?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You're not from around here, are you?
Thank you, Bobby.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You should be more careful.
What happened to your hand?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You sure you can manage?
It's Grace.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Maybe I don't want you to.
Do you have to call me that?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I'm just going to my car?
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Anybody hurt?
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Like you helped her, Jake?
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
What's the matter?
No! No! Please!
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
You haven't even looked at them once.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Wrong number.
