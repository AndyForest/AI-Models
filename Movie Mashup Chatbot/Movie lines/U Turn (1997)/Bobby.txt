You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
You afraid of the dark?
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
I got things to do.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Who's cursed?
What?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
I think I've heard that before.
Maybe I do.
That a fact?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Hell no!
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Oh, Jesus.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Christ!
All right, old man.  Christ.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
I said I was sorry.
Christ no!
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
You can't do that yourself?
You want something?
You want something, old man?
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Give it to me!
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Oh, shit!
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Christ, I don't believe this!
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
I wasn't doing anything.
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Come on, Jake --
What are you talking about!
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
It's the truth, Jake.
I came for Grace.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
It's not what you think, Jake.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
No!
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
And tell her what?
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
How do you want it?
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
I need thirteen.
How much could you get?
You love her, but you hate her?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
You meant it.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
I'm not rambling.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
About what you said this morning.
About things.  About your wife.
I was hoping we could talk.
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Would I what?
Like you don't know.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Hey!
Wait a second--
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
California...
Darrell's a moron.
An overheated car.
Bobby Cooper.
That's a solid name.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Accident.
Yeah...
What the fuck do you want?
You broke my nose!
Grace, tell him.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Who the hell are you?
Get away from me!
Will you shut up!
What the hell are you talking about?
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
How old are you?
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
For what?
You're too quick for me.
Oz.
I've had time to get over it.
Cause she's dead.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
What?
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
I want my car.
Open up!
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
Look, Harlin.
No! Okay! Okay!
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
What sign?
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
You believe that?
You've been there?
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
How much!?
What the hell happened to my car?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Nothing.
Hey.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Accident.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
How much time?
Great!
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
So?
OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
But he's dead.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
You own this place?
Will he be back soon?
Harlin around?
You Harlin?
No! No police.
Soda.  You know.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Got any cold soda?
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
'Cause I love you.
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
I busted my leg!
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
You could give me my gun back.
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
Why?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
You already have.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
I'm not sailing his boat.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
I don't know about that?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
I can't see it.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
No! You get it!
Grace ... Grace?
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
What about us?
I wanted to talk.
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
In <u>cash</u>?
What do you mean?
Where?
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
Yeah.
I'm sorry...
Yeah.
You mean the Shaman?
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
Try me.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Don't feel like nothing.
What's the matter?...Grace?
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Walk away.
You could leave him.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I'm guessing no.
Is that why you're with him?
Did you ever?
You love him?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Are there snakes out here?
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
You know what I want.
Still playing?
I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I have an idea.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Like you.
What?
The same thing you do.
My face tell you all that?
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
A medicine man?
Where'd you learn to do that?
What do you do anyway?
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
Nice place.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
I didn't say it bothered me.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I just drove in this morning.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
You're welcome, Grace.
That's all right.  I got it.
Wasn't nothing.
No trouble at all, really.
Accident.
No, I've got it.
I got it.
Jesus.
May I carry your package, Grace?
I like that about me, beautiful.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
I don't know your real name.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
That's right on my way.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Harlin's.
Morning, officer.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
One way.
How much?
I don't care, just get me there.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Out of here.
I need a ticket.
Sure, I'll try.
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
Genuine Draft?
Heineken?
Beck's.
You got a beer?
