This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Now, what's this?
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Mister!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Stand up.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
You expect me to believe that?
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
I said come on!
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
I axed you a question.
