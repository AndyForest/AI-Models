Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
What's your name anyway?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
But you was going to fight for me.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
How about I pick one out for you?
Got any requests?
What happened to your hand?
I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
I want to stay.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
