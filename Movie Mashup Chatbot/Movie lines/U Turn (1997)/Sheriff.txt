There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
Get in.
Where ya goin'?
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
I think I burned my gun hand!
Son of a bitch!
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
What was that all about?
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
Oh?
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
Morning Grace.
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
