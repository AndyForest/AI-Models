They're waiting for him to walk in.
Terry...?
Tommy, what happened?
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Father Barry.
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too� don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me� who?  -- who?
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Terry...?
Then go ahead� go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a�  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland� the Middle West somewhere� a job on a farm... .
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Well, it's over.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're�
Terry, for God's sake.
Terry, you're bleeding.
Terry, no, no... .
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley� and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened� I'm frightened.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Get away from me.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
Don't tell me� don't tell me!
You... .
Told him what?
Terry� what's happening to you?
Who says?
You?
Terry, what's wrong?
I know... I know... .
Pigeons... .
Go ahead, wear it.
I� I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
It's true.
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
What are you going to do?
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not� I'm just� all mixed up... .
What for?
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
But that's living like an animal�
And if you don't?
You don't believe in anything, do you?
But a priest...?
His� racket?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
Why, Terry, who said it was?
And when things get in your way� or people �you just knock them aside� get rid of Them� is that your idea?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or� or human kindness in your whole body.
Our Lord said just the opposite.
Terry!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Now what are you doing?
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Were you really a prize fighter?
No thanks... .
It's quite�  �nice.
Wham... .
I am?
In a saloon?
I don't know.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Oh she's a beauty.
The things that go on.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested �in pigeons.
That was nice of you.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
The Golden Warriors.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
I really don't know.
What for?
Thanks anyway.
I'd better go in.
Do you like pigeons?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd� get into bad company.
What?
What's that?
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
The moment I saw you.
I can get home all right from here�
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
In braids? That's right.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
I want to be a teacher.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
You know how the Sisters are.
I better get home.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
I'll get home all right now.
Which side are you with?
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
None of your business.
Give it to me� my Pop's job�
Let me by.
Pop!
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
He wanted to see me again.
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Who is he, Pop?
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
