When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say�  �Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me� it's the fault of the nuns!
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies� I'm on borried time.
Down to the wire?
Baseball bats� that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Are you on the level, Father?
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but�
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Who asked him here?
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P.
I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession.  It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie�  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
What are you down here for� to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Maybe I will� one of these days.
You don't think he'd be� helpful?
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
