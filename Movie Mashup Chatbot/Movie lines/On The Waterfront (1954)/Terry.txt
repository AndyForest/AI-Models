I'll come over when I'm ready.
I'm gonna take her home first.
Right now?
It was you, Charley... .
You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
See! You don't understand!
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night� we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready� remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens� This bum Wilson he gets the title shot� outdoors in the ballpark! � and what do I get� a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Wow... .
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
Four thirty-seven� that isn't where Gerry G...?
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
I could have been better!
Don't say that!
Don't say that!
I know. I know.
I don't know� I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Yeah� yeah� I guess I do� but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Boss loader!
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Mm�hmmm.
Mm�hmm.
That's right... .
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's�
Nolan? I knew he had guts but�
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
It's a living.
In a minute.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
Am I on my feet...?
You always said I was a bum. Well�  �not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
Farm...
Every one of 'em... .
My pigeons... .
Jimmy...
But I feel like� My friends won't talk to me.
Thanks just the same.
Edie.
Get out of my way.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Charley.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Edie, Edie, I...
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Edie...
My hand.
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
That�  �word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I know what you want me to do!
I don't want to hurt Charley� I don't want to hurt you...
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
Edie� it's�
What I did to Joey.
What I did to Joey.
I just told the Father.
The Father. The Father.
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me� he says it's up to me.
I've been sittin' in the church.
Edie... Edie... ..
Edie� I� I� never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you� you're... .
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
I don't rate it.
Edie!
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt� What more do you want?
Don't say that, Edie, don't...
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts� you're driving me nuts� stop worrying about the truth� worry about yourself.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
That goes double for me.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now� but I think we're getting in love with each other.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
I� I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And� I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
What are you crying for?
For� not being any help?
You're not sore at me?
I got my whole life to drink.
You haven't finished your beer.
I� I'd like to, Edie, but�  �there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says�
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
Listen� get this straight� don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
What a fruitcake you are!
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed�never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place�they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and�  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But� I didn't stay in shape� and�  �I had to take a few dives.
Hit me again, Mac.
How about another one?
How do you like it?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
Want to go out and have one with me?
Listen, you like beer?
One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
How do you like that one?
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
Good. So do I.
I don't know.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
I only live up there and across the roof.
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little�  I better get you home.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
How would you've done it?
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me�I foxed 'em.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Man, you were a mess!
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were�
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in�
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
You training to be a nun or something?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
I better see you get there.
I'm with Terry.
They play pretty rough.
I think we're O.K.
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
What makes him so special?
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work� with all them muscles.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
...walk?
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
You go to�
You go to hell.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Mind your own business, Father.
What do you want from me, Father.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger� and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
About Edie?
�It started as a favor� for my brother� you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no� a favor� Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but� Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it� stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away� and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
But you've got to listen to me.
I don't get it!
But you're the one I want to tell� what you said over Nolan� about keepin' silent when you know the score� I'm guilty� you hear me? I'm guilty... .
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
Yeah, really!
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher� hooks� over 'n under�  � whop-whop!
Yeah. My own blood� and they sell me out for a lousy bet� I had it in me to hit the top and�  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys�
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and�
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him� boy, I was ready that night.
You want to know something� I would have taken Wilson�
Wilson� yeah�  yeah� I fought Wilson.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
You looking for me?
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'�
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
What?
Never will be much too soon.
I don't know nothing.
Waterfront� Crime� Commission� ?  What's that?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
What about it?
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
I told you lay off.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
Yeah� us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Looking for me?
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
Be sure they got enough water.
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured�  They got it made. Eat all they want� fly around like crazy� sleep side by side� and raise gobs of squabs.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
First things first.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Hit me again.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Give me a double.
No?
Is Johnny in?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Hey look-
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap� conniving�good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done� you hear me? �glad what I done!
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'� take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros�  �away and you're a great big hunk of nothing�  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
You want to know somethin'�?
Listen, Johnny�
Now just a minute, I�
How'd you get that.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
Nothing happened, Johnny.
Aw, Johnny... .
I� I was just on my way up, Johnny.
Thanks, Johnny... .
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I�
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if�
I know, Johnny, I know... .
Thirty-six� sev� aah I lost the count.
Not a dent.  Perfect
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
So-so, Johnny.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
I was only talkin' to her.
What do you mean?
Look who says bum!
Yeah, yeah� Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Go on, beat it!
Nolan... .
Listen� Nolan�
One of these days.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Keep Charley out of this.
