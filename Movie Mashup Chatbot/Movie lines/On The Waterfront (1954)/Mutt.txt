One little dime you don't need.  I know you� you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint�  �only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
Thanks for nothing, you bum.

Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
