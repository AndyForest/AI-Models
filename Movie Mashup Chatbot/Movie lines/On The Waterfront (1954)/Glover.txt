Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top ï¿½oor the folks are usually out.

Our identification.
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
