This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
Then don't.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the� er� as you put it� main order of business?
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
Why should he forget it?
Gimme.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this� a deal I sweated and bled for� on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?�
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers�  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local� that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady� well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out� we take our cut.
Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
Gimme.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Hey, Skins�  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
You ratted on us, Terry.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
Go on� beat it. Don't push your luck.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
I got it. Hot off the press.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
By way of Chicago?
Go on� a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
�Do you?
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this�  �to remember them by.
OK� skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
My favorite little cousin.
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Count this.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
