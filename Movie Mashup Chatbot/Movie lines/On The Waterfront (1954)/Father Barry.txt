You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
Terry... Terry... .
What happened?  What happened?
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Hello, Edie.
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
I wish I knew, Edie, But�
Why Edie, I�
You can!
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley� and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom� with the truth as you know it�  Truth is the gun� Drop that thing and tell the truth� a more dangerous weapon than this little �  �cap pistol.
What did you say?
Give me that gun.
This is my business.
Your gun.
Now don't give me a hard time.
I want to see you, Terry.
Good luck.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers� and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you�  � Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
A question of who rides who.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
What are you going to do?
I'll find you a priest.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
I don't want to hear it in there.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
So help me God!
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
What do you think?
You still call it ratting?
But you still hold out for silence?
Nice fellows.
You all right, Nolan?
D 'n D?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
