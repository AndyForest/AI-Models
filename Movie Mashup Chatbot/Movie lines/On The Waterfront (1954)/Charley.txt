But my own kid bro�
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
I wish I knew.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
I'm not thirsty.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
It'll do.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that� he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Okay� I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but� go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
The point is� there isn't much time, kid.
What the hell!!!
�ex-tanker who's walking on his heels� ?
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped�
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals� you know what they're worth to us?
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against�
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Maybe.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Thicker than water.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
Working hard?
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
That was the idea.
