That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Sir, please lower your voice--
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.
Excuse me?
They range up to three thousand.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
That is for the urn.
We have the urn.
