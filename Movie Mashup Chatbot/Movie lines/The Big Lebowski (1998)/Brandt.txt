Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
This is our concern, Dude.
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Her life is in your hands.
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Well Dude, we just don't know.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
