You monsters!
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
All right, get out.  Both of you.
Well?  Aren't you?
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Brandt, give him the envelope.
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
WHAT?!
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Bunny.
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
Huh?
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Are you employed, sir?
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Did I urinate on your rug?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Stay away from me, mister!
I said out.  Now.
Who the hell is he?
