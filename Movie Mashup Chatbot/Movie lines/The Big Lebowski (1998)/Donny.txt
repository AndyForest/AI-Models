I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Where you going, Dude?
Sheesh.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
I am the Walrus.
What do you mean, Dude?
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
And this guy peed on it.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Those are good burgers, Walter.
What do you need that for, Dude?
Well--
No--
Uh-huh.
They were Nazis, Dude?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Who has your undies, Walter?
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
What's that, Walter?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
It's already posted.
Burkhalter.
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
They posted the next round of the tournament--
What the fuck is he talking about?
I am the Walrus.
What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
If what's during league play?
What's a pederast, Walter?
He peed on the Dude's rug--
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
I was bowling--
What--
What tied the room together, Dude?
