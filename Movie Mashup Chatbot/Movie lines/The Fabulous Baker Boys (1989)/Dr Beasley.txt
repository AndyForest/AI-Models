The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
No bones.
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
They gotta go.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
What's wrong with them?
What's our friend's problem?
Beasley.
