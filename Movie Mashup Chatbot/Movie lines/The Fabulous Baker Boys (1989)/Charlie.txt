It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
It's all there.  Both nights.
We don't need you, Frankie.
Take it now.
Your pay.
Mondays.
Yeah, come on in.
Frankie.
