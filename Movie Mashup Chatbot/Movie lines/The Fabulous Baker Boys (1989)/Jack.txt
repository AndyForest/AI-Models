Just the same.
Maybe next time.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Trunks?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
What do you do to him?
No bones?
How will he eat?
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
How many?
They're falling out.
Teeth.
Baker.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
Go fuck yourself.
Get your hand off me.
Accident?
What's wrong with the kid?
My brother and I. One each.
Piano.
No.
She asked for it.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
Five years ago.  November.
Yeah.
Yeah?
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
How're your hands?
This'll kill 'em.
I'll take the Mallory.
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Go ahead.
Sure.
Yeah, fine.
Right.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Later.
What're you doing?
Who's weak now, big brother?
Fuck you.
You weren't there.
Stay off it.
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
What?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Shut up, Frank.
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What channels it on?
You don't know?
What disease?
What's it for?
Nothing. We get nothing.
We're not getting paid then.
Twenty-eight years.
Better give her pneumonia.
Cancel, Frank.
What're you doing?
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
I can't make the tenth.
The tenth's out.
You're making things up, Frank.
You could've come.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
He was just having fun.
You always threw up.
Yeah.
I told you.  It's a useless talent.
They were simple songs.
A useless talent.
April.
Couple years.
The Royal.
Expensive hangover.
The party's over.
What're you doing down here?
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
You saw wrong.
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
What?
What the hell are these?
She's a big girl.
No. Why?
Time flies, huh?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
How long you been at it?
How's it coming?
Really.
What the hell are you doing?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
Because I can hear it.
Doesn't it matter to you?
Christ, can't you hear it?
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
Why would I mind?
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
We're gonna be here a week?
All night?
You leaving that on?
Right.
Good idea.
Okay.
No, you take the right.
Right.
Okay.
Have some more wine, Frank.
He's drunk.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
I thought we all had separate rooms.
I thought we had separate rooms.
Sunday.
Day.  Wednesday.
November.  '71.
Two years ago.  March.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Yeah.
Very realistic.
Just a lucky guess.
Hey, Frank.
Right.
Yeah, fine.
You wanna get a drink?
Yeah.  Something.
I'll take my chances.
Make it collect.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Oh, brother.
How about these?
No.
She's here.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
Get out of here!
Get out of here.
Awe inspiring.
She'll get here.
It's early.
I'll drop the eighths.
What's the matter?
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
You're getting cold feet about this.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
What are you, crazy?
Let's get it over with.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
What?
It never was.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
I'm not unhappy.
That's what we agreed.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
Sure, why not.
Talk.
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
A gust of wind killed him.
That how you see it?
What was it like?
No?
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
The hell you don't.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
Terrific.
What?
Your doorbell doesn't work.
Yeah, okay.
What're you talking about?
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
Frank?
Yeah?
What's with Charlie?
Her hands.  Like that.
I made her nervous.
So what'd we get her?
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Says who?
I don't gotta go.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
So do I.
No thanks.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
Why the interest?
Only on odd days.
Thanks.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Try the black Knable.
Yamaha white.  Nice.
Bosen black.  Flat.
You got weird kids, Frank.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
I hate your kids, Frank.
So we on tomorrow night?
Fuck him.
Fuck him.
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Count it.
Count it.
Like an angel.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Lotta water.
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
What's wrong with it?
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Frank.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
What's the point?
Am I late?
How we doing?
Thanks.
Brought it.
Funny job.
Job.
Gotta go.
Baker.
He doesn't bite.
Come on, Ed.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Don't worry about it.
No.
Black.  Labrador.
The name's Baker --
Yeah.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
It's been a long time, Ma.
I suppose.
For a while.  She left.
Pretty much.
He leads, I follow.
Frank works hard.
No.
Downstairs.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
I didn't want to wake you.
No.
Hi.
If I see him.
I've given it up.
Vegetables.
What kind?
So how's the cat food business?
You don't pick your brother.
We outgrew each other.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
There's always another girl.
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Look, if you want to leave...
Coffee?
Frank wasn't 'there.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
He had a mind that escalated things.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Long story.
He called her.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
History.
Soap?
Must've been a cheap date.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Friend.
Nina?
How do you know?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
I'm not upset.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I can keep the beat.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
It's a shitty  song.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Hey, business is business.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Like a baby. You?
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
In and out.
It's okay.  Last one.
I guess in case one year they're not.
Every year.
Every year.
Forget it.
Forget it.
You want me to walk you?
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Huh?
The Stratford.
He takes after our mother.
His kid's sick.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Fucking.
You never sang before?
He'll come around.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Another five years, huh?
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
Losing his teeth.
Sure.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah?
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Ever go to church?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
Older than me.
Ivory.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Oh?
How do you know?
The recent past.
My days are not the old days, genius.
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
What happened to the donut king?
Sounds big.  What's he do?
Eddie did.
He's losing his teeth.
Eddie.
I'm not much for sweets.
Huh? Oh, no.
Fine.  You?
Good to see you, Ma.
