Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
So?
Twelve years.
What're you saying, Charlie?
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
What about tomorrow?
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
What's this?
Little slow tonight.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Well, look at this.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Recognize these two characters?
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
How's the birthday girl?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Two nights.
When they coming in?
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Charlie called.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Good choice.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
No.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
I didn't hear you come in.
Jack!
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
Jack, you're on television.
What?
What?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
Seventy-one
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
I don't know.
I don't know. Some disease.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
No.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
Just until we find another girl.
Be reasonable, Jack.
What do you mean?
What?
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
February?
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
Celebrating.  Join me?
How come I didn't hear anything?
He was wearing a suit.
What are you talking about?
Huh?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
Funny, huh?
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Two hours ago!
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
Fine.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
How dare you say you love me.
What's the matter with you?
What?
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
Yeah.  You mind?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
Unless you want the right.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
A few bars!
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Last?
First night?
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
So what do you think?
You recognized me.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
You all right?
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go.
See anything?
Here, how's this?
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
You hit me.
It's not gonna hurt you.
Come on, stand still.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Where the hell is she?
Okay?
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
I didn't get her number.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
All right.  What's your name?
Jack.
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
What's that?
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
No.
It wasn't like that.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
I don't know what you mean.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Nice, huh?
Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack.
Jack.
So you'll come out, right?
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
We don't get a gig.
It's not family.  It's business.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
It's me.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
What do you mean?
You'll see.
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
Your older brother.
You gotta go.
This time you gotta go.
We gotta go, Jack.
No, I mean it.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
It's more than that.
Funny.  Strike a bell?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
Seeing anyone in particular?
Really.  You sleeping?
You look awful.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
What do you think?
What d'ya got?
What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
What d'ya got?,
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Cindy.
It was an accident.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
You're their uncle.
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Jack...
Huh?
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Don't make trouble, all right?
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
Jack.
Jack.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
That's not the point.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
You sure?
No, we're not.  Jack?
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
The audience was a little off tonight.
So what'd you think?
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Doctor's orders.
The flu.
Yes, it is.
Uh... he knows it.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
Right.
Well, that's fine --
Blanche.
I'm sorry?
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
Miss --
We ran long.
You're an hour and a half late.
Impersonally.
Don't take it personally.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
You're an hour and a half late.
We're finished.
This is where the auditions were.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
What're you talking about?  They love it.
What?
Forget it.
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
Well then ... shall we?
Got another song for us?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Hey, will you look at that?
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
Tell her.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Yeah.
Great.
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
Jack?
Go ahead.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Virgins.
Baker's unabridged.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
You two could play checkers.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Jack, you with us?
We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Give me that.
Fucking.
Did you hear it?
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Right.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
They're nines.
Right.
Uh... good.
Big feet.
Nine?
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Come on.  We don't have much time.
Come on.
It's orange!
That!  You can't wear that!
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
Where's your dress?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
What-?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
We're a team.  We work together.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What's the problem?
Ready?
When we know.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
That's the premise.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
Uh, well ...
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Yes, well, they are.
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Born and bred.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Uh ... thanks.
Thanks, Lloyd.
