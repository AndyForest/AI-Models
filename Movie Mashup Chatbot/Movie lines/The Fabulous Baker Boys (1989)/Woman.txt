I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
You find a girl?
So run a little longer.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
How should I take it?
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
This is show business?
My watch is broken, too.
What about me?
What do you mean?
This where the auditions are?
Right.  In there.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
Right.  Bring him back.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
