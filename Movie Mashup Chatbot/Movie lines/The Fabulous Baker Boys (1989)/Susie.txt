And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
I can't sing it anymore.
Huh?
Forget it.
Some discussion.
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Uh ...
Huh?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
What's with you guys?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Huh?
What's with you two?
Oh yeah?
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Wow. You ever see her again?
What'd she sing?
Peggy Lee?
You're kidding me.
Great?
Hey, we're connected.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Smells like fish.
I don't believe it.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
He's right.
Virgins?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
You play all these places?
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
Maybe it's legit.
Hey.
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Hey!
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
I said I was sorry.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Piece of cake.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
You're a prince.
Oh, thanks.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
They're tight.
Shoes?
Zip me up?
What do you think?
Nine!
Nine.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Save it for your wife.
I wear a seven.
A seven.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Time for what?
Hey!
Am I missing something?
What's wrong with it?
Do I look like I'm naked?
What's he talking about?
Changed?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Where's my name?
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
What I mean is --
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
When?
So?
I sing now?
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
Yeah.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Let me get the light.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
Jack.
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Huh?
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
So ... ?
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
You can always get another girl.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
Yeah... No.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Frank said ---
Oh.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
So, what happened?
You're kidding.
Nervous?
You sending me home?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
The both of them?  In there?
No kidding?
Huh?
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby.
Soap convention.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Sure.
Ed? How many people live here?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Who's Nina?
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
You were good.
You were good.
What's that supposed to mean?
All I said was you were good.
You're upset.
What'd I say?
What's the matter?
Better than that.
How do you do it? Every night?
Guess I got a little scattered.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
In and out.
How's egghead?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
Can't sleep?
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
So why's he do it?
Aren't the kids asleep?
He do that every year?
Nothing personal --
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  Ah, here's a lost soul.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
Where's egghead?
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Not for money. With my mother.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
