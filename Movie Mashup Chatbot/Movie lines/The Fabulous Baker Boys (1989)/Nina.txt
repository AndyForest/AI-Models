That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
Jack.
From Hurley's?
Not so good.
How'd the show go?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
What's a prom?
Why not?
Wow.
Looks old.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
I guess it's getting serious.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
What are they?
Is that what you used to do?
Married.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Guess they're up.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
