No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
What the hell is that?
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
Can you get us into Straylight?
What are you doing in here?
I find out now.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
Yeah, well it's working.
Linked?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
No, but it traced me.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
What's he doing to my gear?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
And then?
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
What are you talking about?
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
You son of a bitch...
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
I'd say you were full of shit.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
What does this have to do with me?
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
The access code to your mainframe.
Tell me the words.
Are you even really alive?
Can you read my mind?
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Yeah.
You're pleasant tonight.
I don't have a girl.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Yeah. That was me.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
It's Case. Remember me?
Maybe so...
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Ready?
Can you walk?
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
She's ready to go.
What elders?
What about the route to the core?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
It's coming.
How's the ice?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
Less than thirty minutes.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
How long, Dixie?
How's the ice break?
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
We run. You crack the pattern?
We got problems topside.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
Can you take me to it?
How are we doing?
What?
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
Nobody has.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
What?
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
Right...
Want to fucking answer them?
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
Wait... You hear that?
What about the mainframe's access code?
Case.
I don't know. I don't know...
Where did you here that?
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
I thought you already left.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
I think you're full of shit.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
And Linda...
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
I know who you are.
I'm still going in.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Shit...
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
No we don't...
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
Is he going to make it?
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
I know you have. C'mere.
What went down between you and Riviera?
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Something exotic I hope.
I'll be okay.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
Yeah... fine.
They'll cut you down.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Shhh...
...Feels like you.
It sounds like you.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
On a good run... yeah.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
I'm going in.
What the fuck... are you serious?
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
How soon is soon enough?
I gotta know... did it work>
How long have I been out?
Holy shit...
What?
Maybe something's onto him.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
What about before that?
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
What's my end?
Why should I want to meet him.
