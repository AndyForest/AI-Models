Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Then we would have talked, you and I.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
Of course.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
I'm fine.
What about her?
You're hurt...
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
