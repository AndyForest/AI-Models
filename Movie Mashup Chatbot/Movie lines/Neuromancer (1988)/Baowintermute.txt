It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
The words?
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
