Case... are you okay?
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Hello, Case.
