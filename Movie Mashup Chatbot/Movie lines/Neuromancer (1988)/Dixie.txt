I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
You haven't got it?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
You're late.
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
How much time you got left?
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
Yo.
It'll flatline your ass.
What are you talkin' about?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
Where the hell have you been?
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Yo.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
No problem, amigo.
Never heard of him.
Who got you into this?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
