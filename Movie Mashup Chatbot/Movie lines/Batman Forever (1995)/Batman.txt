Help Chase. I'll be back.
I haven't had much luck with women...
You are direct, aren't you?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
We all wear masks.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
What's wrong?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Why's that?
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
And you are?
Exactly!
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
