Tonight's a good night.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
And another name for Mystery?
How about, MR. E.
Letters in the alphabet.
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
What do maniacs always want?
All the answers are numbers.
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
...A bat.
...Afraid.
There's one other thing. I feel..
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Why do I keep doing this?
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
Maybe they're right.
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
The _Rolls_?
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
He ran away?
Is he all right?
Don't be ridiculous.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
She has an excellent mind.
It'll never work.
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
I think they're getting worse.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
Banzai.
Slanta.
Nostrovia.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
We'll talk some other -
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Mr...?
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
...Not the bat?
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
I don't-.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
I don't want to remember!
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
I'm not-
What?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
I said I'm sure he did.
He sure did.
Fast work. You just moved here.
But...
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
That kid is amazing.
What? This isn't normal?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
And into a black dress.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
To kill me.
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
Not much.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
Wacko? That a technical term?
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
On occasion. Usually at night.
Just ones this beautiful.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
What the hell did you think you were doing?
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
What I do isn't about revenge.
Absolutely not.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Excuse me.
