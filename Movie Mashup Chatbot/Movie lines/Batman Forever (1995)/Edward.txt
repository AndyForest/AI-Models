I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Rinka.
La'chiem.
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
So glad you could come.
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
Wait. You can't go.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!

I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
I'll show you it works.
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
