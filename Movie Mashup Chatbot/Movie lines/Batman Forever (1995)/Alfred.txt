All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
What now sir?
Enigma.
Mystery.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Recognition, of course.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Master, Bruce?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
What?
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
What?
Perhaps the fall...
Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
How are you feeling, young man?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Dr. Meridian...
Why, indeed?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
Actually, he took the car.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
No. You said I. I killed them.
What did you say?
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
Apology hastily retracted.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Scholarly research?
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
Hardly a worry, sir.
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
The dreams again, sir?
Just checking, young sir.
Master Wayne's dead wives.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Al?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
