Four seconds from...
Up here, Al.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Big house. How many rooms?
How ya doin', Al?
Bruce, you can't.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
You can't-.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
Back off, man.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
I need to be part of this.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
Okay. I'm outta here.
