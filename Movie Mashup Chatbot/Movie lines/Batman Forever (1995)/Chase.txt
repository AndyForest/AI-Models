Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
My life's an open book. You read?
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
Now black rubber.
What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets.
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
He's home. I sent the signal.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
What are you talking about?
What?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
You do know. Try.
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
Stop fighting.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Touchy, touchy.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
Why do you do that?
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Find anything interesting?
And now....
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
What?
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
Well, I met someone...
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Like normal folks.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Excuse me.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
That's usually my line.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
What do you know about obsession?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
Exactly.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Edward...
Chase?
