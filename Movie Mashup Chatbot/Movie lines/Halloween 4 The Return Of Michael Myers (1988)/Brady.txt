We're trapped in this house.
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Is there another key?
You think she stands a chance?
Look.
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Who's that?
What's going on?
Are you two okay?
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
No, you don't understand.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
So?

I'm not angry it's just
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
When did you find this out?
So?
