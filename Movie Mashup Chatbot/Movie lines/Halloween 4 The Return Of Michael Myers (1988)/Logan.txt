Do you?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Where are you going?
Hell of a night.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Got it Ben.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
What are we doing?
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
132 to 133 this is 134.
No problem, Sheriff.
Right here, Ben.
