Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?

We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
