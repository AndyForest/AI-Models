Okay, bye.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
You won't come on too strong.
You won't look pushy.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Hi Jamie.
