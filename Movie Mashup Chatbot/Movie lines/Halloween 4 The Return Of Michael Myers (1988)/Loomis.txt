Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
How many bodies did you find?
How many people in the bus?
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Why wasn't I notified?
No.
Yeah.
We'll hear sirens soon.
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
What are you doing out here alone?
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Its not over yet.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
How's it powered?
Where's the radio?
Where's that Deputy?
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
Evil.
It isn't a man.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Dear God.
Yes.
Least I'm not alone.
He's been here.
When he makes that call.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
Its true, Sheriff.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
He's here, Sheriff.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
I know that Mr. Sayer.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Sort of.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
Thank you.
