Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
An accident?
When did this happen?
Now where are you going?
Four plus Myers.
Why shouldn't I?
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
I can see this is useless.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
About what?
Drive Carefully.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Outside.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
