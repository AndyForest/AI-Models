Why don't you go make some coffee.
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
Just do it.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Get the outside shutters.
Go get it.
You got your riot gun?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
This is 132, over.
You look sharp. You understand?
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
It's over.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
Be here in a minute.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
Oh Christ. Doc...
Is that him? Is that him?
This is starting to spook me.
How do you know?
Something?
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Why?
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
I am. Ben Meeker.
Jamie! Get away!
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Now you understand?
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
