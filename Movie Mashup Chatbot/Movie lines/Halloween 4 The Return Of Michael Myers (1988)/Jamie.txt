I can't.
Come on.
Rachel come on.
Oh Rachel!
Can we go home soon Rachel?
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
This is great Rachel. Come on.
I thought you said you were ready.
Come on Rachel!
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
He's coming to get me Rachel.
It was the nightmare man
Come on Rachel.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Hi.
Double scoops?
I don't want to.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
It's been eleven months.
Sure it does.
Like a real sister?
Like a sister?
Do you love me Rachel?
I can't sleep.
You don't believe that do you?
Then we'll be safe?
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
