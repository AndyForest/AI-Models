Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
This looks promising...
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
Catwomen. Lots of them!
God, can you hear me!
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Car wash, Captain?
I got her...
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
God-damn..
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
What a "drag."
