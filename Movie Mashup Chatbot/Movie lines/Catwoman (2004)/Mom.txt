Trust me, you won't have to.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor.
Don't sneak up on me...
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
You're late.
