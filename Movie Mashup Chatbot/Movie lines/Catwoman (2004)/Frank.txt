Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Hey, you're anti-male.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
