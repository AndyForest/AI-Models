In a minute, sir.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
In the ship, sir.
Yes, sir.
Nothing, sir.
Nothing, sir.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Harry?  Can you copy?
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
It's not sucking, sir.
Working on it now, sir.
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
