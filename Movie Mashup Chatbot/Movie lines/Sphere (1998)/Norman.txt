I see it.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Jerry?
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
What for?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
Wait a second --
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
You don't want to know.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
But sir --
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
Harry's missing.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
I don't know.  That's the point.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Picked up something?  What is it?
Take a look.
What's wrong with oxygen?
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
What team?
It doesn't make any sense.
It's impossible.
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
Hold on --
-- Wait a second --
Geologists?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
What do you need me for?
Then why am I here?
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
How deep is he?
They didn't tell me anything.
Storm?  What storm?
From what?  What's with all the security?
Press?  No, I haven't.
Nothing else.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
What team?
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
Thank you, Colonel.
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Beth --
Hear what?
What?
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
C'mon --
Beth -- gimme the gun.
I --
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
Beth?
Stop it!
Then where's it coming from?
Beth, stop it!
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth!
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Get away from the door, Beth.
It's not safe for you to be either.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Beth --
I promise --
Don't, Beth.
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Shut up, Beth --
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
That's bullshit.
Yes.
I never went in that sphere.
You're insane.
You manifested that, Beth.
That's when you went in the sphere.
But --
You're lying --
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
Someone did.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
He can't manifest.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Did you?
Are you manifesting them?
Do you fear them?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
You know what I mean.
How do you feel about snakes?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
You think I'd really drink that?
I'm feeling better.
Your watch.
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
The sphere looks different.
Where are you?
Not believing you.
I'm sorry.
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
You want to kill him?
Beth --
Doesn't say.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
Three to six hours.
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
It's like a sleeping pill?
What's that?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
Parasolutrine?
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Riordan?
Bingo.
Tarazine?
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Sintag.
Valdomet.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
Diphenyl parlene.
Looks like some sort of code.
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
I don't know.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
He translated it wrong.
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
Page 87.  "I could never read that far."
Page 87.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
You think?
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
We must've had it delivered then.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
The refridgerator.
Fixing it.
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
He what?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Still clear?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
But I don't know how --
You fixed my suit?
I would.  But my suit --
In case you die, too?
Why should I go?
Four days?
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
You, me and Harry?
It's not worth the risk.
Forget the sub.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Beth --
Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
Don't do this.
Beth --
What?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
You went through Edmunds' things?
Where did you get this?
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
So what?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
What are they?
What could have done this?
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
Beth.
Beth --
Beth.
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
Beth --
And you didn't tell anyone?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Wait a minute.
What do you mean -- not normal?
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
Yeah, it was awful.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
We have a library?
Where'd this come from?
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
Get this thing off me.
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Yeah.  Drowning.
What -- are you threatening me?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
It never occurred to me.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Underwater?
Wait -- down where?
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
Is it coming from our own computer?
Where's it coming from?
When did it come across?
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
There is one possibility.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Wait!
No idea.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
You got her?
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Shut up and catch.
I heard!  I heard!
Hold on.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Hold on.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Shut up and open the door.
Help me lift her.
I don't think so.
It's the squid!  Stop it!
You know what it is, Harry.
That's right.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
How do we decode it?
Wisconsin?
But why would she -- ?
You didn't say that about the food?
Beth left?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
Harry?
You don't remember that?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Getting anywhere with those?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
That far in what, Harry?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
What is it, Harry?
Then explain it to me.
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
You remember opening the door?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
What noise?
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
No.  I didn't say that.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
I can't believe that, Harry.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
So what?
I don't follow you.
Not a clue.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
To what?
Whatever I can do to help.
Look, would you --
Wait a second, I --
No, why don't --
I'm fine.
I'm not being defensive.
Fine.  I'm fine.
What?
About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
Beth and Harry?
How are the others?
The ships?
Does this mean what I think it means?
Told me what?
What report?
Really?
Captain who?
No, they didn't say --
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Who's everyone?
Know what?
What report?
What report?
You've heard of me?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
I'm not sure.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
What was it?
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Well, he's polite.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
The creature?
This is like nursery school.
Please, Ted.
I don't see anything.
You mean a picture?
Like what?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
You want me to try?
He wasn't feeling well.
I don't know.
What?
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Four.  Four years --
Don't be so supportive, honey.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
You seen my suitcase?
