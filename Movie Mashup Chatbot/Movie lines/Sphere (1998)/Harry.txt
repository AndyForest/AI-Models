If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
She's not gonna know.
What -- you want me to retype it?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
She's not gonna know, sir.
He understands me fine.
It's not ignorant.
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
Please watch your closest monitor...
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
Ted?  Captain?
Then how can it be chipped?
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
How much damage?
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
Yes you are...
You're staring at me.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Another attack?
Just in time for what?
In time for what?
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
I never said that.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
It's an American spacecraft.
You'd have to ask them.
For who?  The fish?
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
You mean forget?
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
How's that working out, by the way?
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
Well, press something!
You know how to work this thing?
I'm trying.  There.
Her legs are in the way.
Gimme a second --
C'mon, Norman!
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Missed.
Push her, c'mon.
I can't reach her.
How far away's the sub?
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
We're never gonna make it.
Fine.
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
Did I kill her?
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
What is it?
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
The three of us.
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Wisconsin's your answer.
She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
She's cracking, Norman.
I thought she was with you.
Her suit's gone.
When I woke up, nobody was here.
What happened to her?
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
Norman, where are you?
... you there?  Norman?
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
Did I?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
What are they?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
Norman?
You don't understand about the sphere.
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
What are you still doing here?
It's like...
What is that?  That noise?
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
Then what, Norman?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
Am I?
Gimme another explanation.
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
Our present.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
This answers one of our questions.
Time travel.  A black hole.
Our answer.
Nice work, Norman.
C'mon, Norman.
C'mon.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
You sound defensive.
Don't be defensive.
You holding up alright?
How are you feeling, Norman?
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
Good idea, Ted.
"We are friends".
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
Well, if it's a discharge --
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Do you?
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
Think about it.
Is it?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
That's right.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
She told me what you said, Norman.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
