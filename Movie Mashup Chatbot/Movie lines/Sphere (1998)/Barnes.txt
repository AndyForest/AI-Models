Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Please, Dr. Levine.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Fletcher!  Now!
Get out of there!
Fletcher, get away from there...
Fletcher, I want you back here.
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Pull it, damn it!
Now!
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Do you see it?
It's either that or we grow gills.
Increase positive pressure!
He's right beneath us.
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
Thirty yards.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Forty yards.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
Fifty yards and closing.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Direction's east coming!
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Nobody move!
Nobody move.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
They told me about sixty hours.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
What is it?
I said back away.
Back away then.
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Pull it.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Going active.
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
You think he killed Edmunds?
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Edmunds?  Can you copy?
Damn it, Edmunds?
Edmunds?
You don't think weapons are important?
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
What am I -- a dog, now?
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
-- and then brought her down here --
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
When was this?
She should've known better.
I think I do.
How drastic?
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
What do you mean, he's missing?
Just worry about yourself.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
Everything can be killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
What?
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What is it, Norman?
It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
They pressurize us with helium.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Maybe older --
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
What?
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
A thousand feet.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Anything else?
What have you been told so far?
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Captain.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
They've left, keep watching!
Well, where the fuck is he?
What the hell is going on here?
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
Any sign of Harry?
They're coming.
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
What caused it?
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Can you open that panel?
She wired this system.
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
I'm in charge.
What?
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
How do you mean, strange?
What's the message?
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Gimme a report, I want --
Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
You don't know that.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
So?  What's the problem?
The what?
So how do we get it open?
A break for what?
What?
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
Yes, Harry.
I did.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
It's chipped.
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
Resetting the sub.
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Edmunds?
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
From the sphere?
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
Internal power.
They switched us over.
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
How can he be missing?
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
We had considered it.
What do you make of this?
Radiation shield, you think?
What is it?
Ted, get her away from the door.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
