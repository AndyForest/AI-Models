Norman, please!  Don't!
Don't do it!
Norman, don't do it!
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Don't do it, Norman!
That's our reserve air.
What was that?
Where is it?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
But you've tested it?
High Voltage?
What do we use for defense?
What if it attacks?
What was that?
Nice work, Captain sir.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
But she's --
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Yeah.  I heard you.
Two and a half days?
How long will that be?
Norman!
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
How about I just press the button?
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
Hold on --
Would you wait a minute?
Wait a minute --
There's heat coming the door.
In basic English, what does all this mean?
How big is this spacecraft?
How's that?
Would it work?
Get away --
Get away from me!
You hear that?
What is that?  What are you doing?
Top shelf, is it?
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
Leave me alone, Norman.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Don't you know?
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
It's either this... or I kill you.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
But I have to, Norman.
"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Is it?
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
C'mon -- what?
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
You think I manifested the snakes?
No, he can't.
No, he isn't.
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Don't you?
You tell me.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
I did do that, didn't I?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
It's getting cold.
Are you?
What's wrong, Norman?
Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
How's Harry?
What do you mean, different?
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
What is it, Norman?
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
For what?
Only lab rats.  Here.
You ever given an injection before.
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
It's an idea.
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
How fast does it take effect?
I'll just boost the doses.
How long does it last?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
Causes sleep.
It's a soporific.
How do you spell it?
Antibiotic.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Nothing about drowsiness.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Ulcers.
It's for motion sickness.
Something for burns.
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
But why is he doing it?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
How can the sphere do that?
But how?
You think, in the sphere --
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
What?
Manifested?
Squids?
What?
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
You don't believe me.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
None of this was here before.
Wait a second --
That wasn't in there before.
The refridgerator.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
You get it straightened out?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Still clear.
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
What's the matter?
Still clear.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
You don't trust me?
I fixed your suit.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
Don't bother me, Norman.
I have to reset the sub.
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
You bastard.
You did, didn't you?
You told him about me?
You said something to him, didn't you?
Don't tell me to calm down!
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
In Edmunds' things.
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
Eggs.
Norman.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
What?  Why...
Yeah, why?
What?
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
What about you?  What happened to you?
My gosh, Norman.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
The library.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Norman!
Good theory, Ted.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
You're next, Norman.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Because when we get down there --
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
That's quite a secret.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
I love secrets.
Who says it's a he?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
I don't get it.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
We can refuse to talk.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Like what?  I'm not --
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
What?
Just in time, too.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
What are you looking for?
Then what is it?
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
For whoever's in that thing.
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
