What sub?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Too big?
What?
What is that?
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
What's inside the sphere.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
To what?
Sir, about leaving --
Did you hear me, sir, because --
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
What's wrong?
A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
Some sort of lead or something.
Look at this.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
I'd also like it noted --
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
A half a mile long?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
By the bunks.
Well, what's your theory?
It doesn't make any sense.
Well, they're not mine.
No.  I don't think so.
Pussy.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Thank you.
What'd you say?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
Arrived?  From where?
Please.  It must have flown here --
Meaning?
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
But it's impossible.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
English?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
What is it, Harry?
What does Norman already know?
What'd you say to him?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Not that I know of.  Why?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Why's that?
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
Unless it's an act.
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Try this one.
Squint harder.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
He's a pussy.
