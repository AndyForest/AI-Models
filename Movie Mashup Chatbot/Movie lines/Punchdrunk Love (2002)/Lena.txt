You don't think you'll go --
If you come to Hawaii --
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
...yeah...
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Oh that's great.
Are you learning how to play it?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Did you pick it up from the street?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Ok.
What did he want?
What happened?
Is everything ok?
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
So that was your pudding?
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
Yeah, no, I see --
Yeah.
Yeah.
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah?
Yeah.
No, no. I did.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
About six months.
Yeah.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Who is it?
....Hi.....
Ok.
Yeah.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Do you want to pick me up?
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Really?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
Oh My God.
What do you do with all this pudding?
It's terrible, no.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
I saw a picture of you.
Business is good, you're busy?
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Hi.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
There's a piano in the street.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Do you know them.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
They're not open yet?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Ok.
Should I call you later?
I'm sorry. You're right.
He did seem a little strange.
It's fine.
No.
Ok.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
Ok.
Bye, Barry.
Are you ready?
You ready?

It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
It's not bad, it's ok.
Yeah.
