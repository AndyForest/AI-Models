Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
Don't puss out.
I'll see you there.
Yeah but I'm serious.
You can't just stay in your house.
Seriously.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
You can't be late though.
Seriously.
I'm serious.
You can't be late.
What time are you gonna be there?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
What are you doing?
Are you going to the party tonight?
What are you doing?
