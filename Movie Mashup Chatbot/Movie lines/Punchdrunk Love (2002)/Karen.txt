Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
So you can't talk to me?
Yeah but what are you doing?
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
