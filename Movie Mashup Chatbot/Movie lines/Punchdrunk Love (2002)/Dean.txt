That's that.
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
I'll say whatever I want --
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
Now are you threatening me, dick?
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Who is this?
That's it.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Your expenses are your own.
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
When can you leave?
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
Put him through.
What did you say?
Hello?
What's the problem?
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
I'm only paying two of you guys.
