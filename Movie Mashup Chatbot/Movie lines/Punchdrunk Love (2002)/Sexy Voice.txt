You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
....this is your mistake....
Are you telling me no?
It was cool last night.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
No you won't.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
You lied to me?
-- you said you did.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I need help.
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
We got disconnected before....
I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy. I mean, I have all your information, credit card information and billing stuff --
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
So you think you can?
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
Really? Please?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
You don't even know how much it is.
Yeah.
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Can I ask you a question?
You're going to work now?
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Georgia.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Where is she?
You have a girlfriend?
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Are your pants off?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
Do you like porno movies?
Are you watching a porno movie?
I'm in my bedroom.
I'm just laying on my bed.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
This is Georgia.
Hi, is this Jack?
