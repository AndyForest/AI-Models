It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
You want her to call you Jack?
No one will know your name.
It's ok, take your time.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
And your Social Security number.
And your name?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
What do you mean?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
