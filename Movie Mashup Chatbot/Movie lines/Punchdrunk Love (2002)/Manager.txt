That's fine.
The police are on their way.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Your hand is bleeding.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
How?
You're hand is bleeding.
Well who did?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Did you do it?
Just have you for one second, please.
