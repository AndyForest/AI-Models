We gotta move...
The gun will be there.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
Understood.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
You heard about your father?
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
Outside.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
