Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Hey, beautiful girls!
Take me to America!  You need a good lupara in America?  You take me, I'll be the best man you got.  "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
You tell us about America.
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
