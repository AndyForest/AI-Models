Will you give this letter to Michael.
Will you give this to him.
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
What was that?
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Is it true?
Tell me!
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Will you?
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Don't you want dinner first?
Oh Michael.
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
OK.
Please say it.
Tell me you love me.
Can you say it?
I LOVE YOU.
I love you.
How is your father?
Michael...
Michael?
Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael.
What time do they expect us?
What will your father say?
Just you.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
How do you do.
He's coming over here!
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
Michael, I love you.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Michael...
Al Capone!
You know I love spaghetti.
Yes.  Tell me.
Who is he?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
They're talking to themselves.
Michael, what are those men doing?
I've never seen anything like it.
