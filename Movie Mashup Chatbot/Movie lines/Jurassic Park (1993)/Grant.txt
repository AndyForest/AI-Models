Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Are you sure?
- - and swallows fresh ones.
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - a gizzard - -
- - like birds - -
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
Not just every six weeks.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Dilophosaurus.
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
We're out of a job.
How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
Say again?
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
The movement!
What kind of park is it?
And what are those?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
The Cretaceous.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
They smell.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
Go, go, go, jump!
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Amphibian DNA.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
You got me.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
Tim, are you okay?
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Really?
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
Listen, ahh - -
Oh, yeah - - great.
There's gotta be something - -
We gotta do something.
Relatively.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
Where does he think he's going?
Fine.
I didn't say you were scared.
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
No.
Yeah, they hate me.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
What'd I touch?!
Why?
You're married?
You got any kids?
You have no idea.
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
Try to!
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Who?
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Let's get outta here!
Can't you stop these things?!
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
What kind of opinions?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
Hey, we were saving that!
What works?
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
Watch how it eats!
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
You're a beautiful big animal.
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
All night.
I'll stay awake.
I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Tim, Tim, Tim....
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
It's safe.
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
Let's get you out.
Tim!  Lex!
