Yeah.
In a box under my seat.
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
Up and down, up and down!
Dilophosaurus.
I can't see.
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
I can't!  I'm scared!
Nope.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Straight-A brainiac!
"Thunder lizard!"
I doubt it.
That's a good idea.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
No.
Yes it is.
I threw up.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
These look kind of familiar.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Whichever one you are.
Tim.
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
I read your book.
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
That was great!
Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
I hate trees!
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
Why did you do this?
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
Excellent.
Thanks for the presents.
