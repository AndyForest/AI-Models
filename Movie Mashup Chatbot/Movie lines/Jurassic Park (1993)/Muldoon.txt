It's all right.
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
No. We can't.
C'mon on, this way.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
Stick to my heels.
Come on, let's go.
I'm going with you.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
They're not here.
I don't know.
Dr. Grant!
Ellie, com one!!
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
Sure.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Thanks, Steve.

I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
