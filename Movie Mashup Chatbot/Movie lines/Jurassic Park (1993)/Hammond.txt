- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
Where did the vehicles stop?
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
What now?
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
What?
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
Damn!
You're sure we have to?
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
Once we have control again we - -
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade...
They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
Could I have a tissue please?
There you are.  Out you come.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Ah - - they're here.
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Wu?
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
For a further three years.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.
Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
For today, I guarantee it.
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
Your silence intrigues me.
Don't do that!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thatï¿½s all it is!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
Well?
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Ray, start the tour program.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
