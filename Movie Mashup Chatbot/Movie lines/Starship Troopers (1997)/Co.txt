Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
