This time of the year...?
Oh, my, what's that ?
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
Good good, then it's all settled.
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
