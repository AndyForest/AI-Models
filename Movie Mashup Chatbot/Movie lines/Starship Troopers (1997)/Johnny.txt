Saddle up, Roughnecks !
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
We're the old men, Ace.
Not enough, I guess.
What about it, Diz ?
He was our teacher... He was great.
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
Death to all bugs !
YAAAAAAAA !
What do I want with a scar ?
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
It's what I deserve.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Well, maybe you better look again.
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Something... I've got...you don't.
What an honor...
Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Sir, no, sir.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
I don't believe it !
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
How do you make him do that ?
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
Ace of spades.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Did you read her mind ?
What's the hurry ?
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
We've gotta go get her !
See you on the bounce !
How are you, Carl ?
I like it. It's kinda...you.
What happened to your eye ?
That was just a mix up.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Should I be ?
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
What happened to your hair ?
Shhhh...!
Do you mean it ?
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
I love you.
I'm gonna miss you.
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
You're late.
I'll go for that.
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
Did you get Starside R&D ?
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
I love you, Carmen.
Who cares ?
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
I can't help it.
You two have so much in common.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
None at all... We won.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Isn't it great to be in love ?
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
Carl can wait.
Why not ?
It's all I think about anymore.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
I have good reflexes.
Who ?
Good for you.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
All bands.
Diz, see what you can do.
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Hey, Diz...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
What's that, Diz ?
Well, see ya.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Cover me.
What ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
You saying you didn't ?
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
No thanks, Diz.
You're the best.
Uh, look, Diz...
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
What ?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
I won't quit !
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Mr. Rasczak.
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
I wouldn't mind.
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Sir, yes, sir !
Sir, thank you, sir !
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Courage, I guess.
No, sir.
Here in Buenos Aires.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
Hi, mom.
Well, yeah, sure...
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Uh, no.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Don't be a hero...
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
How bad are you, pal ?
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
Can you walk ?
Move out.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm gonna save Carmen.
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Give'em hell, sir !
We're not leaving you here, sir !
Hit your jets, sir !
Cover us, Ace !
Yes, sir !
What's going on, Diz ?
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir !
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir.
All dead except one, sir.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Mister Rasczak ?
Uh, I don't know.
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
