Looks like rain.
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
...CUT OFF !
Teenagers !
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
Oh, is that how it is ?
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
