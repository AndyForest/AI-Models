Nothing.  Nothing at all.
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
What was he doing in the rec room?
That night?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
You can't let anybody leave!
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Maybe.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
... I think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Watch Clark.
I don't know who to trust.
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
