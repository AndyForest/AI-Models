Where these tracks headed?
I know.
Maybe dinner.
Let's load 'em.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Just listen.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
We'll see...
Have you come across Fuchs?
What?
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
How you doin', old boy?
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Too damn dangerous.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Neither will we.
Not the only one.
I think so.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Then I'll have to kill you.
For your health.
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
What clothes?
What are you doing?
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
What?
We got morphine, don't we.
He's gone already!  Do it!
Torch them!!
How the fuck do I know?!
Probably the next meal.
That's good enough.
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Look, I'm just guessing...
Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
Torch it over there!
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
I guess you're okay.
And if anyone tries to wake me...
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Would that test have worked?
Well, who's got access to it?
It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
What are you doing?
Anything?
Hey, Sweden!!!
Come on, Copper.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Little over two hours.
Looks good.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Damn if I won't.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
I am going after them.
Don't let up, Childs!
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
Tie up Clark, too.
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
We going to make it?
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Move it, Palmer.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
What's...
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
Can you think of any other tests?
Then we go after him.
Calm down and get in your position.
The generator!
Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
Anyplace but here.
Everything that's been missing.
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Just keep looking.
Well, let's get down there.
Yeah!
What's happened?!
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
Who else could have used that key?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
So what do you make of it?
What for?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
