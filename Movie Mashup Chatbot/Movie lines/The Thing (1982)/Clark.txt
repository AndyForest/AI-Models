What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Yeah.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
