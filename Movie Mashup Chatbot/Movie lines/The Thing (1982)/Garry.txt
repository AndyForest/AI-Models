I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Anybody sick?
So what's our problem?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Was dark... find a light...
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
You catch anything he was saying?
Well, get to it.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
In this weather?
Nothing we can do about that.
What's that?
How many in their party?
That far?
How far's that?
I'll put this right through your head.
Put that down!
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
Well, stick to it.
You reach anybody yet?
How long's it been?
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Extinguishers.
We're on fire!
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
