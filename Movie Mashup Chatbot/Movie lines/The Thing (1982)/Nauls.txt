You promise?
Now why'd you go and...
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
What you doin'?
Finish what?
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
It's shorted out or something!
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Childs!  That a fuse?
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
Bet the last place you ever go.
Maybe it ain't coming.
Position, my ass...
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Screw the generator!!
Get back!!
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
What about Childs?
Where was he trying to go?
What is it?
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
This storm do that?
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
Hear what?
He's one of them.
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
