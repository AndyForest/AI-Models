No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Hell no.
If it did get to him.
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Now hold on, you dumb...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Let go of me...
Now who'd go and do...
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Don't walk behind me.
Ain't it there?
Cool it, Palmer!!
You lying bastard...
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Cut him loose?
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Clark, you come on out here!!
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Then we'll never make it.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
What do you mean "you think so?"
Spaceship of some kind.
Load of bullshit.
We should have jumped his ass.
Then kill me.
You ain't tying me up.
What for?
We ain't buying that.
You been made, MacReady.
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
Gee, thanks!
Garry's missing!
MacReady!
What do we do about those three?
But...
What we going to do?!
Where's the other half?
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
You buy any of this, Blair?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Well, go on.
MacReady!
The dogs?
What's happening?
