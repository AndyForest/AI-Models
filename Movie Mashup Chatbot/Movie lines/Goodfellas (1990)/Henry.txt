Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
I understand.
Nods again.
Nods.
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
Why would I get into that?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Wha?  Me?
Oh I Him.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Tell him. It's okay.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What happened? You okay?
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
You what?
You know. The stuff I left.
Where's the stuff?
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
Just get me out.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
What did he say, exactly?
Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Never.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
We've got to help each other.
It'll be okay.
Stop! Stop!
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Jezuz Christ!
What are you talking about?
Shit.
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Son of a bitch.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
That again.
How much?
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
What bag?
Get inside!
Go inside. I'll be right there.
I'm in construction.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How?
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
Nah.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
What'll I tell Fran?
Paulie's gonna make him?
There are cops all over the place.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
I gotta talk to you.
Jimmy.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
It's been six months.
What?
Paulie was just talking about him.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
He heard.
Will you stop.
Done.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
I can't make any more deliveries.
What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
You know what to do?
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
You ready?
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
Tommy  ...
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
