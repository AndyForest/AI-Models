What about the schools?
I got scared.
I got seared.
Oh no! No!  Noooo!
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
I flushed it down the toilet.
What are you talking about?
Who's gonna do that?
Then you're safer in here.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
With what?
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
I can't do it anymore.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Let her carry this shit inside.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Henry.  Wake up.
I don't care. Something's going on.
I'm gonna need some money.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
The bag with the envelopes.
My bag. My bag.
What are you gonna do?
They don't feel like you're in construction.
What do you do?
What're you doing? What about the car?
Talk? To you? After what you did!
Liar!
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
He's with his friends.
That's important.
I don't want them left back.
I got dry cleaning.
