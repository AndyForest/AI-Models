Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
What kind of person doesn't call?
He didn't call?
