Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
