I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
I better call again.
You want the melon?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
Watch this.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Don't worry about it.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
Have a drink first.
Give'm a drink.
We did it.  We did it.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
Keep 'em coming.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
The third store down.
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
