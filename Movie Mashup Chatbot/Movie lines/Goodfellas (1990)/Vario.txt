Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
You treated me like shit.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
I warned you a million times.
Anybody!  You understand?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
What did you hear about that thing?
What?
You want a partner?
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
