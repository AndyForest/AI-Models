She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Those are her belongings.
Do you know what happened to her?
Yes.  I remember her.
Yes... I remember Mary
