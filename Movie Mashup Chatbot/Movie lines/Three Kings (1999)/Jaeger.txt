He's not slowing.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
Really?
What?
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Epps?
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Epps.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
How do we do that?
Well?
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
But...
When did you make the switch?
The...the gold...
Which way do we go!?
Can you ride a horse?
I didn't say that.  I never said--
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
Why haven't they killed us!?
Is that good, or bad?
What do you make of them?
What do we do?
To where?
What do we do?
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
Can't you--
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
And then what?
What are we going to do?
Oh, God...
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
Probably.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
Yeah, I guess we should.
Well?
Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
What do you figure it is?
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Just let me rest for a second.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Getting cold.
I pick that way.
You sure you want me too?
Wonder how the war's going?
What do you think our chances are?
Sorry.
I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
I don't want to die.
Epps?
What?  Yeah.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
They'll search the pack.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
No.
No.
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
Wes is dead!
Forget Wes.
How!?
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
Wes might be right about that.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Why do I have to stay down here?
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
Wait.
You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
Is it dead?
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
Must be a compartment.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
What does it look like I'm doing?
So where do we start?
Think there might be more Iraqis?
If they land--
They're going to kill us!
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
Where the hell is it!?
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
X marks the spot.
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
What are they doing here?
It's a fire fight.
I don't hear any--
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
How's this going to work?
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
My leg is falling asleep.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
Epps...
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
Why you got to move away to talk!?
Where you going?
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
It's a mine, isn't it?
Oh, God!  Oh God!
I heard it.
I heard it click.
Mine.  Land mine!
Mine.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
I got that...sir.
We leave it.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
...I know.
Millionaires, man.
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
Steady it out!
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
They're not going to--
They'll shoot us!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
Wh-what do you think--
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Oh, that's fun.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Roger that.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Wait.  Wait.
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
You think?
I did it!  I got the box open.
OH MY GOD!
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
There might be.
There might be something in there.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Blow me.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
At-at-at-at-at.
What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
Some good ones.
The photos.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
I could use some recon photos too.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Woods.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
You're going to burn up in those.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
I think he wants something to drink.
Maybe we should give him some water.
He lived through that?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
I think we found something.
Yeah, we're down.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
Think we can make it?
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
So?
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Epps...
You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
You have to go with us, Wes.
As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it.
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
Yeah, well, we're not.
You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
Yeah!  Yeah!
They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
Iraqis.
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Yes!
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
With...with millions.  Millions of dollars.
We...we could go home with something else.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
At-at-at-at-at.
At-at-at-at-at.
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
What!?
It doesn't mean anything.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
Like I said; so?
Yeah.  So?
What?
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
Naw, nothing.
I could.
For real?  A treasure?
Yeah, you're funny.
What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
What is this?
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
What does that mean?
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Oh yeah.  Accidently.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
People are suffering.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
Okay.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
A headache?
