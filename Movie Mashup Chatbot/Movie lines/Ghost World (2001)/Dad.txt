But I can't --
I just buzzed him in.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Yeah, I heard about that.
About what?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Are you still looking for a job?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Yup.
Maxine.
Give up?
Someone from the past.
Guess.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
