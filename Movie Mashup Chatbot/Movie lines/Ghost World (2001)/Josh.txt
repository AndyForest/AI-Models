Are you ready to go?
Hi Enid.
Okay... I promise.
Why not?
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
How long have you been up?
Oh, hi...
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Yeah, well --
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
When did I say I hated you?
Nothing.
Yeah, right...
What do you mean "why"?
Do you want something to drink?
Are you the one who left that note?
Hi... what's up?
Yeah, well... hi...
Hi.

No.
Forget it.
Jesus, look at this guy.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Yeah, right.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Aren't there a million places like this?
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
No.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Yeah.
I agree.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
