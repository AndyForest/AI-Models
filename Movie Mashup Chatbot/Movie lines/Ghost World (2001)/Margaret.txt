Right, exactly!
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
I am.
