I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
What are you trying to say?
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Hello...
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
