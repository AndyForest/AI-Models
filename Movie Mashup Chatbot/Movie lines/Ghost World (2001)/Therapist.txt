Do you have a check for me?
Seymour?
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
Why don't we start with that next week?
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
