Get a job!
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Oh, how "punk."
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Punk rock is over!
Didn't they tell you?
