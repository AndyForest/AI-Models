Wow... finally.
Do you want anything?
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
What time?
That's all you're bringing?
So where's all your stuff?
So, whaddya think?
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Hello?
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Nothing.
He came into work.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
Just some people from work...
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
How repulsive!
What happened to Seymour?
Hello?
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Don't you want nice stuff?
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Look, we have to get these...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
God, you're really obsessed...
Go ahead...
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Do you want to do something tonight?
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
Now are you going to get a regular job?
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Get away from me!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
You're just jealous.
He gives me a total boner!
You're gross.  See that guy?
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Like what?
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
He does that every single day.
You cunt!
No way... when?
Where?
Where did you get that?
Wait...
I totally, totally hate you.
I don't believe you.
What? Where?!
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
How about this?
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
Ew ... when did you get that?
How about this one?
I didn't get it either.
What was that all about?
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
Should we leave a note?
I'll bet he never jerks off...
JOSH!
Why don't you ask him.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
There he is...
"Hassle"?
Where are we going?
It's always closed...
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
Just promise you'll do it.
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
"Funky"?
Somewhere downtown.
Not really...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
That was truly pathetic.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
Gross!
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
We should follow him home.
Are you sure?
Do you think he knows?
What's he doing now?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
I can't believe it!
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
SHUT UP!
I want to "make love" to him.
Look, maybe that's him!
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
What does it stand for?
You're better at it.
You call.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
Fuck you!
What are you talking about -- who?
I want to do him!
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I remember every minute of that party.
What a little hosebag.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
What is this?
So what should we do?
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
Gross.
You can have that one.
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
I might actually get the pasta special.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Okay, okay!
Or maybe not.
That lets us off the hook.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Much later.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Did you sign up yet?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Why?
Hi.
Good.
How perfect.
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Forget it...
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
This is so bad, it's almost good.
You loser.
Why?
What?
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
Call me sometime.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
I wish I could see him.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
Please Josh?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
That slut!
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Why? What did she tell you?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
She's not at home?
