Still got your sense of humour.
Sod off.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Jack! I didn't like that.
Can't say I do.
Still got a sense of humour?
Making a living.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
What's it to you anyway?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Meaning what?
Oh, that's nice.
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
No, I didn't know that.
What you doing around here then?
Jack Carter.
