I don't know nothing.
It is. Honestly.
It's the truth.
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Yes.
Nicer than most.
He was all right to me.
I can't.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
She's nothing to do with me.
What about?
Everyhing go off all right?
