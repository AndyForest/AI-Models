You coming back?
What you going to do?
And that'll make me feel better?
Not much.
What, and get myself beaten up again?
No. Are you tired?
Did you sleep well?
Uh-huh.
Do you want breakfast?
Are you awake?
What's that supposed to mean?
How'd you know I wouldn't?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
You're a bastard.
What you going to do?
What about Keith?
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
They bloody hurt me.
What'll they do to him?
No.
You sod.
Now just a minute...
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
I'll call the police.
And what you going to do?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy.  And who's he?
You don't look it.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
It'll cost you.
Is he staying the night?
What is it?
Ta.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Will this do?
Are you a traveller?
It never is.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
I see.
