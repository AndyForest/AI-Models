Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
'Good.'
Yes. I told him.
Nothing. What could I do?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
A couple of weeks back.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Yes.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
I know.
I know. I know.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
