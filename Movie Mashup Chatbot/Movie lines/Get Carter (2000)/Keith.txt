Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
Oh yes? How?
Get knotted.
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
How'd you find me?
Yeah.
Who's Brumby?
Four of them.
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
Where you off to?
Nowt.
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
That's what he was saying about you.
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
What you having, Jack?
How'd you know Albert?
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Right.
Yes.
Don't know.
It just would. He was always the same.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
I mean, what for?
At the Half Moon.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
