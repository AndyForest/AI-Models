No.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Your brother? What you talking about?
Expect so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shouldn't think so.
I don't know.
What girl?
You've been watching the film.
You sure about that?
That's why you waited for me.
Especially when I play the lead.
Now you're asking.
Entertaining.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Brumby.
We're there now.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Nasty.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
Could you do me a favour?
He was here for four days.
Yes, while he was here.
We went about together.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
Yes. I met him last year.
Yes.
Sid Fletcher.
I know him too.
Do you?
You know Sid Fletcher?
You know Sid Fletcher?
