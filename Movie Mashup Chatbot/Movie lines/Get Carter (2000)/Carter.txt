You knew what I'd do.
What did he say?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
What did you do?  Albert?
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
And you told Brumby?
Who?
How?
When did you find out?
How?
Did Eric Pake pull her?
You can't get away from me, Albert.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Was he?
How'd it happen, then?
What about the brakes?
Was the steering faulty?
Yeah.
This is my brother's car.
What happened to this car?
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
That's not good enough.
Why?
Why?
What name?
Yes.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Never mind.
I made a mistake.
I made a mistake.
I know.
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
Address?
Where's he living these days?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Yes you can.
Who paid you to see me off?
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
That's nice.
Good evening.
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
What was bugging Frank?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I call that regular.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Though nicer than most?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
How were things between you and Frank?
Tomorrow morning, then?
I want to talk to you later.
Really.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Doreen.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
And you didn't know her last name?
Now tell me the truth.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Then he must have pulled her.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Was it Albert?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Tell me about the girl.
I want to give you an Oscar.
Sure I'm sure.
Not entirely. No.
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
What kind of entertaining?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
Is he coming here?
Who's setting you up in this place?
And what was that?
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
How'd you know where I'd be?
Of course. Where else?
So where are we going, Princess?
No. I didn't know that.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Was he?
While he was here. You went about together?
Really?
No.
Really?
Go on.
No, do you really?
Oh, do you?
Who?
Yes, I do.
I work for him.
What?
Thanks for coming.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Have another?
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Nice of you to come.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
Where's that?
Where you going to live, then?
You coming to South America?
You all right now?
That must be interesting.
Oh, what you doing now?
How's school?
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
Sorry about your father.
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Did they give you a rough time?
What happened to you, then?
Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
How many?
Las Vegas.
See you later.
Good lad.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Large Scotch.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Where would I find him?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
You work here, Keith?
Nobody seems to know.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Why would it?
That's what I was wondering.
Did you work with him, Keith?
What?
How could I stay away?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
I don't want to get rough, do I?
They're friends of mine.
No chance of that.
Do us a favour?
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
Are you tired?
Yes, thank you.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
No.
Think about it.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
You wouldn't.
So shut up.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
Pension him off.
What about Keith?
That little shit!
You're lucky. They kill as well.
Don't ask me.
They came back?
Ta-ra.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
No, you won't.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
No. Really, I am.
I'm sorry.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
My brother, Frank.
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
You sure?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Definitely.
It's not like that, luv.
I'm staying with a friend.
I won't be using the room tonight.
Eh? Have a drink.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
You should have told me who you were working for.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
That's all right, Eric.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
It would be. If they were still living.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Funny, that.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Eric. Eric Paice.
Is he?
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
I have to. Things to see to.
Yes.
Yeah.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
Yep.
Scotch, please.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
