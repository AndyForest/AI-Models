Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Not going, Jack?
Nasty way to go.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Piss off, Ray.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
No.
That's right.
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
Ha.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
That's right, Harry.
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
