I'm in.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
Thank you.
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Somerset...
What the fuck is going on?
Shut up!
What the fuck is going on here?!
Just keep leading the way.
Sit back.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
We would have gotten you eventually.
And, why is that?
Delusions of grandeur.
Murderers like you?
Murderers?
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Spit it out.
In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
Where we headed?
Put the gun down, Somerset!
Put your gun down!!
Tell me it's not true.
What did you say?
What are you talking about?  What happened?
Wait!
Kiss me on the lips.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
I will.
No.
Well... what the fuck, man?
You know he's fucking us.
When do we get to question him?
Big surprise.
You knew I'd say yes.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Oh, you want to stay now?
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
You do your job...
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
He's preaching.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
Then, he must write about these murders.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
We had him.
No point in arguing anymore...
Okay... okay... get off.
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
We have probable cause now.
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
It was him.
I'm fine.
Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?
What are you going to say?
Sure.  Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer?  Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
This is a waste of time.
How do you know all about this?
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
So they ran our list.
How is this legal?
You got to be kidding.
What?  Assessing fines?
Him?
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
Well, that was money well spent.
I don't know... like fifty.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
And so what?
We don't know for sure...
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
Sorry about that... I just...
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
It is Victor.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
Satisfy our curiosity?
We'll tag along.
The fingerprints.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Does this make it with you?
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
Bullshit.
Oh, that's all.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
And you don't?
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
He just may be nuts enough.
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
What?
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
What the fuck is that?
Nothing.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Okay.  But, what?
I know.
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
Nothing.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Forced what?
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Punishing.
We put her in a safe house.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
He cut along the side of his stomach.  The love handle.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
You go to movies at least?
What about sports?
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
How's that?
Well?
It's my wife.
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
Can we talk about this in private?
Whoa, whoa... what?!
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
It could be nothing.
This doesn't make any sense.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
You think it was poison?
I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
It's a bucket of vomit.
There's a bucket.  Under the table.
There's a bucket here.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
Who said this was murder?
For now.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
I realize that.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
I... I don't follow.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
What?
Are you absolutely certain?
Anything... anything missing or different.
Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
