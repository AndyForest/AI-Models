I want to have children.  It's just...
I hate this city.
I don't know...
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Perfect example.
I'm sorry, I only...
I don't sleep very well.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
How long have you lived here?
It surprises me.  It really does.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
