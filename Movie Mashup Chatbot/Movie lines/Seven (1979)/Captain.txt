What do you think?
Ease back, Mills.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
How's that?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
How you feeling?
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
It's always been like this.
I heard.
You know.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Yeah.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
There was a second.
Have you heard?
You've left unfinished business before.
I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
So what?  This victim...
Announcing what?
