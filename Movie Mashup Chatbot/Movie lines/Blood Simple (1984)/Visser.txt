Nah, I trust ya.
...it's too damn risky.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Nobody knows you hired me?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
So it would seem.
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
...What kind of fish?
Ya catch any fish?
Ya catch any fish?
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
I want you to go fishing.
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
You're an idiot.
Well what?
You want me to kill 'em.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
If the pay's right I'll do it.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
...Anything else?
Now that don't make much sense.
Most of the night...
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
...Just doin' my job.
What do you mean...
