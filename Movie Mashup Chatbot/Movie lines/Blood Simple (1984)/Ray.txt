I think someone's watching.
With your gun?...
What do you want to know?
Isn't that what you want?
In the trunk.
All right...
...Who?
...What was that?
...That's what's important.
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
Yeah.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
Yeah.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
I said you're bad.
You're bad.
Abby--
I don't know. I better get off now.
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Abby... you all right?
...You ever get tired?
...Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
What'd he say?
Uh-huh.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Yeah? What happened?
...Well I'll be damned.
...Huh?
Door's locked. Nothing there.
You wouldn't be putting me out.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
On the phone. Was it for you?
Who was it?
I just gotta see a guy.
See a guy.
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Your husband.
Yeah.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
You owe me for two weeks.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
What's that?
...Why?
Got a problem, Meurice?
Thanks Meurice.
Is Marty here?
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
