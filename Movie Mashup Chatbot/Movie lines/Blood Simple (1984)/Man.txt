Lubbock?
...Friday?
What?
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Back where?
What's the matter?
...You know that car?
Well now you do.
I told you. I like you.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
Uh-huh.
