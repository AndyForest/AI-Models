I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
I own the place.
We don't seem to be communicating--
...So what're you doing tonight?
So how long have you know Meurice?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
Then what'd you come here for?
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
What "what"?
...Count it if you want.
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
Of course.
Jesus, I don't believe it...
...What did you do with the bodies?
Dead, huh?
Got something to show me first?
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Yeah...
...What?
Yeah. Is it...
...What?
...There's a big--
For the money.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
What do you think?
I didn't say that.  Well?
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
It's not strictly legal.
Got a job for you.
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
No. It just made them feel better.
How long did you watch her?
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
What did you take these for?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Meurice...
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
That's not the point.
This.
What's this?
Deuce in the corner needs help.
Don't throw that out.
Pour that back.
Red Label.
What's this?
How would I know?
Has Ray come in yet?
