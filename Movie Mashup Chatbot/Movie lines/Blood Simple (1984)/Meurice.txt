You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
Abby...
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
Well I do...
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
Abby. What's the matter?
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
It won't?
I am?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
What night is it?
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
What's the point?
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
What.
Right.
Right.
What.
Right. Sorry.
You said the usual--
I don't know, didn't he call?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
For what?
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea...
Howdy stranger.
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
What day is it today, Angie?
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
Where was I?
