Meurice--
Sort of...
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
No, I--
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
Thanks, Meurice.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...So?
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...You leaving?
...Where is everything?
...What's going on with you two?
Marty.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What the hell happened, Ray?
Ray--
Well... what happened?
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...What do you mean?
...You called me this morning.
Yeah...
Why didn't you get into bed?
...What?
...Ray?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...You all right?
Ray?... What time is it?
Hello?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
I couldn't believe it either...
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
Well... the couch would be all right...
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
What?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Where... where you going?
...Drive me to a motel?
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
What was that?
...Ray?
