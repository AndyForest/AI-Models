They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
Jabez! Careful --
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Of course I will.
We will --
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
No -- that's for me to do.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
You know that you're in my house.
You're lying.
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
Belle --
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
