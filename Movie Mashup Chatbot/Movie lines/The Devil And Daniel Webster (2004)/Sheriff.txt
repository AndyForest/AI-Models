Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
