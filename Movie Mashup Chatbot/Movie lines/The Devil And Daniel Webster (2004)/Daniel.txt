Anybody can see that.
What's that, sir?
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Why? It don't hurt.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?

Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Mama!
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
No! No! I won't.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Not me!
Grandma, look at me!
I did not, Grandma.
But I like the new one better.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
