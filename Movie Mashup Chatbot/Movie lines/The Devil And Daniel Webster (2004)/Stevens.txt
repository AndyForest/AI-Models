I do -- and I think you should too.
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
But what becomes of our souls?
-- of what happens after we die!
You are afraid!
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Where's everybody?
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Mornin', Jabez ...
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
No, Stone!
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
I can't be honest with them.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
I want someone to talk to ...
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I wanted to give it all to the church.
