We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Loan shark -- hey?
