Say ... about the interest ...
Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Howdy, Jabez.
