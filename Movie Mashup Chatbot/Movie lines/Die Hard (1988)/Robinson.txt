-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
No, sir.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Give me that.  Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --
Is that him?
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
What's it look like?  We're going in.
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
How do you know?
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
