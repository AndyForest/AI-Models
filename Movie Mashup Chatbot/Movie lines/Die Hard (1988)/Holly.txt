What are you going to do?
Where are you going?
Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
How about his job?
John.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
You did.  You murdered by Boss.  Now...  They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you.
I...have a request.
John!
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that, John.  I deserved that.
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
...I've missed you.						*
I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Oh...Where does he live?
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
What are you doing?
Sure.  Follow me.
