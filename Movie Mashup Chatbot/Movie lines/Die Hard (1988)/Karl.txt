'Asian Dawn Movement?'
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
Hans, he killed by brother --
And if he alters it...?						*
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
Nothing...
