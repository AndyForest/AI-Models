Longshanks promised!
He will. I know he will.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
He was a modest man.
Does anyone know his politics?
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
I must... consult with my father.
I am trying.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
