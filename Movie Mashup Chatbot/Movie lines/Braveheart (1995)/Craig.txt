He has already agreed to come.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
It is suicide.
We cannot defeat this --
We must sue for peace.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
But... what will you do?
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
He won't come.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
Young Robert, we are honored --
