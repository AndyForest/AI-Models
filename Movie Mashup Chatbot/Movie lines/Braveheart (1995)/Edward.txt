You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
The Scots will fight for us?
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Wallace has sacked York!
I have ordered conscriptions...
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
You fancy him.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
The little cow is insane --
Wallace's followers.
You mock us with a smile?
You may.
Now, my flower, do you understand?
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
What is it?!
