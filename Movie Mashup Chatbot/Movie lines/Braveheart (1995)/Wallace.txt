I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
So let the council swear publicly.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
Peace?!
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
No. One of us is enough.
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
I rest.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Stephen ready?
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
Hamish, I... thank...
I do not confess.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Treason. Against whom?
I need you so much! I love you!
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
I'm dreaming.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
You have... you have a husband.
Why did you?
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
It's battle I want, not talk.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
And I will consult with mine.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Exactly.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
They've tricked us.
