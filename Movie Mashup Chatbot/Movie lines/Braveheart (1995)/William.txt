What are they doing?
It was in Latin, sir.
I don't want to leave.
Good to see you again.
I will not.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
You win.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
It's up to us, Hamish!
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
Three, maybe more!
They're coming!
Then when?
Tonight then.
I've missed you.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I'm not just saying it!
I want... to marry you!
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Thank you for accepting.
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
