...Tonight!
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
You scare me.
Nor I!
I... accept your proposal!
Did it work?
You've been here before?
You are. And I'll come again.
Thank you for inviting.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
And I with you. But you must wake.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
