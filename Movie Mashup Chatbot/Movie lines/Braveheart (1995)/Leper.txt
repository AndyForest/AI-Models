All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
