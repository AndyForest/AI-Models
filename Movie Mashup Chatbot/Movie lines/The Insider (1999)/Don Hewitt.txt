The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
What the hell are you doing?
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.

You're taking "no" for an answer?
So, what are you going to do?
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
You're exaggerating!
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!

Yeah, I heard rumors.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
Lunch?
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
