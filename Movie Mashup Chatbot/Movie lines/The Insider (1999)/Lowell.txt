You got a deal.
How long?
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Yeah. Catch you later.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Push it.
When's your deadline?
P.J.'s.
We gotta hook up.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Good.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Get me Wigand.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
When's the air date?
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Shit...
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
What do you mean, what's it do?
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
Before you go...
No, I'm not...
I'm not touching my film...
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
Catch ya' later.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Debbie...
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
Come again?
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Catch you later.
How are you, Jim?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
You ready...?
Why?
Yeah?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Yes.
Yeah.
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Thank you, Bob.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
I got perspective.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Jeffrey...
I'm alone on this...
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
They're killing the Wigand interview...
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
Let me call you back...
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
Oh, my God.
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
Who is this?
Yeah...
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
Yeah, I'm here.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Area code 212-555-0199.
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
Everything interests me.
Mike... in my...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Oh, please, Mike...
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Oh, lots.
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
I think it was a disgrace.
I disappeared on you?
Yeah.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
What?
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
Oh, man.
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
So, is everything okay?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
What's this?
Hardly new news.
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Yeah.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
We're there.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
What I've seen... I've liked.
Yeah... Thank you.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
That's bullshit, Jeff!
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
That's not the point.
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
She sued you for back payments of child support?
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
No? No, what?
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
You mean... since this morning?
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
You attract a crowd.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I heard.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
Good. But Jeff...
Jeff...
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Excuse me. Yeah...
Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Yes.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
You believe that?
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
You charge by the hour?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
What did you get us?
It's okay.
Hello. You there
It's obvious, isn't it?
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
You okay?
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
Seven dwarfs?
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
What are you talking about? Where are you?
If you want to do it.
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Did work.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Far as you go where?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
What's happening?!
Hello, can you hear me now?
What about now?
Did he hear you?
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
