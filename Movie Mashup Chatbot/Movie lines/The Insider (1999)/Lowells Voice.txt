Where you staying now?
What do you mean there is no family?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
What are you talking about?
You called me.
Well, what do you really think, though?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Just give me an example...
