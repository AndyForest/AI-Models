Yes, baby?
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
That remote control thing?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
How about you?
Do you want more rice?
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Yes... Jeffrey.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
That's for food.
Use the bathroom.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
...taping?  What are you taping?
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
No, thank you.
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
Why? Who said?
I don't understand.
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
Right now?
What do you need at the store?
Uh, what are those boxes?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Don't you have to be at the office?
