Where?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
Instant rice...?
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Yeah? What for?
What's new?
Hi, honey.
That computer has everything...
...my files! Personal correspondence...
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
What caliber is my gun?
A gun? Yes.
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
What's the difference...
Where should I wash them?
I'm doing an interview.
What's going on?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
Thomas Sandefur...
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
I didn't want to leave it there...
That's my stuff from the office...
Soy sauce...
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Try the car.
Is there any more rice...?
I can take her.
You try and have a good time.
Where are you, anyway?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
You greased the rails!
You manipulated me into this...!
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
I told the truth... I told the truth.
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
What does this have to do with my testimony?
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
ABC...?
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
What?
She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint...  Any other questions?
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
I told the truth!
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
No.
What?!
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
No. I mean since whenever...
What's changed?
I don't know what to do.
Yeah, great.
Did you have a good day?
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
Lowell, I can't afford --
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
I'll call them, Lowell.
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
They do this with impunity!
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
I don't think you really understand --
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
You believe that?
No.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Why?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
Next to your father?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Tempura...
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
...okay.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Good.  You have kids?
The new place? New.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
Like what?
They should be.
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
What do...
Good. I want to talk to you.
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
Fuck you, too!
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
Should I just take the documents now?
How much would I get paid?
Did work.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
...but that's as far as I go...
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
I know what I have to know.
Like what? Your sign?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Black, black...
Who's that?
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Liane has filed for divorce...
There is -- there is no family.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
She's okay.
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
"I would bet on it."
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
Poor communication skills.
Most certainly.
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
You're gonna get your fix...
A delivery device for nicotine.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
Jail?
When should we do this?
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Is that a threat?
Chapter and verse.
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Seven...
