All right. See you...
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
Alright?
It would be better if he called us.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
That's right...
I'll call you then.
Alright.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Hello.
