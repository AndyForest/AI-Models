Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Hector, don't interrupt me.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
No.   It's mine.
Anybody know about that car outside?
