But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Okay boss.
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Okay boss.   Where are they?
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Everything?
What'd they take?
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Hey boss, it's not a science.
You said don't do it, boss.
Go look.

What hotel?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
