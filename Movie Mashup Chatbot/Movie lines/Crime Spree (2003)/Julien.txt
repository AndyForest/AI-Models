That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
What for?
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
I thought they came with batteries.
Do they come with batteries?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
Go where?   The police are outside.
What do we do?
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
What about transportation?
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
Okay.    I will have a beer.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
I see.   A master criminal.
What is it you do, Sami?
We both know I'm already dead.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
I'll drive.
Relax. It will be fine.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
