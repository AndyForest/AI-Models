Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
I don't know.
I know they won't be home tonight.
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
Yes.
No, I didn't.
You can use my car.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
They don't have a wine list.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
Stick around and find out.
After last night I could say the same for you.
Sounds boring.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Can't sleep?
The lucky ones.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
You got it in a bar?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
Did she break your heart?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
They're not nice people.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
You like shoes?
Take a nap.
Tonight.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
