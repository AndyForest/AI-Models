We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
But you were there?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
Good word.
They're gonna be what?
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
And?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
You have something for me?
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
Where are you staying?
I only have your word for that.
And the other half?
And for my help I would get what?
You want me to help you get out of the country?
I assume you want something?
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
