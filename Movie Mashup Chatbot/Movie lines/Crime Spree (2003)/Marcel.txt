Oui.
Should I call you back?
Oui.
No.
Oui.
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
It's me...
It's Elvis...
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
No.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
I was told to take what we have and go.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
There has to be.
Oh yeah.
The map said to go left.
How about Canada?
No.   How much?
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
What the hell is he talking about?
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
Give it to me, Sami.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
The baseball is mine.
God, I want to go home.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
Mr. Taylor?
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
-- I want to be Elvis.
You lived there. You know the city.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Going somewhere?
