Yeah -- you do that.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
Why are you here?
Okay.   How much?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
-- Super what?
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
Good.   I'm good.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Yes.
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
He missed three weeks.
You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
Uh, no --
Someone else coming?
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Great fuckin' song.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just find them!
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Everything.
Everything.
Yeah, French guys from France.
They were all French guys.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
What happened?
Get in the car.
I said a clean break.
How's my brother?
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
The hell it is.
Yeah.   It's mine.
Okay.    Okay.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
What's this?
What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
She seems pleasant enough.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
