And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
And the Vodka.
What about the money?
You want Zero to kill him?
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
Where are you from?
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
And how do we do that?
We don't know that for sure.
What does arresting us get them?
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
And you don't speak French?
