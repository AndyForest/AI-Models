You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
They don't have a murder weapon?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
You killed her!
Wired?    I ain't wired.
What are you doing?
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
Do you know who this is?
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I will.
Does it really matter what I say?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
What?
Some bread and...
Anybody hungry?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Hadley --
All right, knock it off.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
We have to find Sophie.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
No.   Chicks dig me.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
I'll be Elvis and you--
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
We've got to get out of here.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
This kind.
They don't serve wine here.
Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
No!
No.
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
It's good.
You guys used to work together?
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
nan
No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
It's my idea.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
Me?
Yeah, I can see that.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Glenmorangie.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
You're not helping.
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
Where is it, Sophie?
Wait here.
Holy shit.
Oh, you think?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
I don't know.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
You wanna tell him?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
I can't even hear myself think.
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
Algeria.
Why?
Who are you waiting for?
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
It's not your fault.
No.
Who's gonna see it there?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
You ask a lot of questions.
Something like that.
Something like that.
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
You ever hear of jet lag?
When do we go?
Thanks.
