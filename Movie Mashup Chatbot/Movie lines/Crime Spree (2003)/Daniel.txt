Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
It's Daniel.
You don't trust me?
What?
C'mon, Laurant, America?
Uh, yeah.
Where's your brother?
Thank you.
How about if I call you?
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
Half the tapes.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
I guess we're going to find out.
What kind of business?
For what?
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Tonight?
Jesus!
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
Why is everything an argument with you?
Because you're the closest.
Get that, will you?
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
We can't.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Bring me the scissors.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Cops?
He said to go fuck yourself.
We'll see.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
Hopefully no one.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
We'll think of something.
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
I can't believe you didn't check.
You didn't buy batteries?
Turn on the flashlight.
We still have to get out of here.
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
Do I?
You're sure?
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.
That moron.
I think he's already figured that out.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
You better.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
You haven't answered my question.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
Can I trust you, Sami?
What'd you get?
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Hello?
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
No?
Has to be.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
It's not?
Good idea.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
This is Zero.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
I'll tell you when it's time.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
We had a deal.
-- Did you set it up?
It's me.
Fine.
How much?
Why haven't you turned us in?
I'm from Belgium.
I've got a way with people.
Don't bullshit me.
Guns.   Can you get them?
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
