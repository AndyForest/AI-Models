I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
No, you don't!
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Four to six.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
