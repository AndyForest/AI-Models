Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
