If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
