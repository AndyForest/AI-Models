Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
That's all you've had all this time?
How many men are working with you on this?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
Splendid, love to see them.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
