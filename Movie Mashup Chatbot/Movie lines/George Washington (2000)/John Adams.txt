They are... friends of Congress.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Lafayette is a child!
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
Partially...
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
You think that?
Oh, come now...
Makes you gag.
Let's not over do it...
Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
