Unofficially, General Greene.
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
The British army, sir!
General Lee is detained captain...
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
The man is a traitor!
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
George!  So good to be back!
I understand, George.
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
