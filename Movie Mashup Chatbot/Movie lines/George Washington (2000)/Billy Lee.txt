Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.

Yes, general.
Yes, general?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
That you would have known you can trust me.
A lot of years have gone by.

Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
