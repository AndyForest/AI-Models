By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
