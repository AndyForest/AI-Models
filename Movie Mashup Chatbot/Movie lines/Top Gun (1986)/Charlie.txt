I live here, remember?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Well?
I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
I know exactly what you mean.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
Looks like a tie.
Your watch.
And that's one!
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
That's up to you.
Take something off.
True.
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Want to play the game?
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
I like to play "reality".
I sit. I think. I play games.
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
You don't believe that.
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
What?
What do you want?
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
Do what, show you a good time?
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
That's what you get flight pay for.
That's not what I hear.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
This is it, then.
...they say you're alright.
Where'd you get it.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Danger?
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
I'm still second best.
In that order?
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
I want it understood.
You always get what you want?
And now?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
Where?
You're totally insane.
It's just as I thought.
Are you really that brave?
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
Winston Churchill.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Does it bother you?
You ever think about killing another human being?
You don't have to kill it.
You're horrible
No!
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You're an animal.
Why'd you do that?
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
Make what?
I'm starting to sense that now.
Used to what?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
What about the plane?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
How about what?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
Uh hum.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Lieutenant...
I can't.
Yes. I'll give you that!
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
There you go with those moves again.
Apology acknowledged.
For what?
And far too aggressive.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
No.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
It never came up.
The what?
Two miles.
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Where were you?
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
It's what?
Where did you see that?
You saw a MiG 21?
Why not?
I beg your pardon.
That's all!
How did you know this was my car?
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
Yeow!
I'm with someone.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
And on to a bigger one with you?
How so?
That's a big comfort to me.
It isn't?
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
I'll bet!
