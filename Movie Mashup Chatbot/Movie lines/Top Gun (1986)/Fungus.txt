Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
What do you want?
What do you want?
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
You're not supposed to...
Is it you?
Is it the plane?
Is there something I should know?
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Gotta go, man.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
I know!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Ohhh Mother!
AND HE'S GUNNING.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Since when did you care about paperwork?
What are you doing?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
