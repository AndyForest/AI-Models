You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
No! Now we're inverted!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
You're crazy. We're level.
What?  What is it?
What is?
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
That's missile lock!
He's pissing me off!
Let's hope you're right!
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
Did what?
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
You think you can stay up with us.
No shit. The Iceman....
Who's your pilot?
This is Maverick.
The list is long, but distinguished.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
1000.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
Time to go.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
Something bothering you?
What the hell is this?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
Come on, we're next.
Just once, if they take your plane away.
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Great move. Great
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Gotta keep track of the competition.
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
What are you doing?
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
What'd you do?
They should have warned you about that one.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Mav's a great flyer but....
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
Skipper, you can't do this!
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
