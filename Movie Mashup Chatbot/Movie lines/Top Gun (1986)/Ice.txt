Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
That's not what I heard.
Got you here.

You saved our lives. You did it!
I guess I owe you one.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
ON THE NOSE?
LOOK OUT!
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
IT'S MY SHOT.
GET LOST!
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
