Right on the flight line?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Well what?
I hope you find him.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
...Something like that.
How could you?
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
I was, later.
Who's gonna win?
One more.
That's three.
What does it mean?
Off me or off you?
Now?
Goose is dead.
What truth?
How does it go?
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
How do you play reality.
What kind of games?
What do you do when you come here?
It does.
Hardly ever.
That's what I want.
Yesterday.
I want it back.
No.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
You don't have to do this.
Where are we?
Not to me.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
I was flying...my responsibility.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
What?
I'm fine.
Pawn shop. What's to eat?
Just good luck.
Lucky charm.
Why, what's gonna happen?
. Yeah!
You ever fly an F-14?
Well no...inverse order.
Food...and you...my F-14!
Why?
Anything.
I don't know yet.
And now I want you.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
You want to go ballistic?
Come on.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
What?
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
About as much as they think about killing me.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
It's not suffering anymore.
That's true. What are you?
It dies. We live.
nan
Anything.
Let's make it at eight.
I'm different.
What plane.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
What if he's not?
Harmless!
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
What are you talking about?
The what?
Evan... or Maverick.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
I'm special.
Too aggressive?
Um. You.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
It is combat. Every second counts.
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
What would?
You let me make a fool of myself.
You know. The finger.
Two meters.
Two.
I was inverted.
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
On his six.
Yes, ma'am.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
It's classified.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
I saw one.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
I thought he'd never leave.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
I heard of one once.
Yeah, most likely.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
I could be, too.
Well, it is. It is that, too.
It's not that.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Yes sir!
Sir?
Yes, Sergeant?
No sir! But you have to be ready.
Yes sir!
F-14's sir.
Yes sir.
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
YEAH, COUGAR?
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
ROGER, COUGAR.  Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
Let me do the talking.
Any more MiGs?
What do I want?
Well what?
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
But I have to!
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
The plane is fine.
Just relax.
You go. I'm staying with it.
280, 290, 300 knots.
I'm not losing it again!
No! Not again!
Okay.
I can recover. Hold on!
I've got it -- hold on!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Yawing right.
Roger, I've got it.
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
BREAKING LEFT!
Okay, okay.
Not anymore.
Saving them some paperwork.
NO. NO GOOD.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
Let's go. Eject.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
I can't eject.
I'm pinned to the panel.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
I want him!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
I've had enough...for now.
What?
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Come on, relax...
It's a victory roll.
Right.
We did it!
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
I've lost him -- where is he?
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
You ever done this before?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
No. You can be mine!
We did it.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
SHIT!!
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
I think I can work it out on my own.
Nope.
Figured out what?
Helping him in.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK.  I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Morning, Coogan.
You didn't help.
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
It was bad.
Didn't everybody?
Yes sir..
Yes sir!
Sir?
Me?
He's a good pilot.
Would you take me back? Would they?
You think I shouldn't fly.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
It's not true.
I never heard that.
He was by the book, all the way.
I'm nothing like him.
I know.
You think I should quit?!
I don't know...
Or....
She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
I called your house.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
I know. I was there.
All right.
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
For the same reason you are.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
I can take care of myself.
I lost.
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
Yes sir.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
Yes sir.
