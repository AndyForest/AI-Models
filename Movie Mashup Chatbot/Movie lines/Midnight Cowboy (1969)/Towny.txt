You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Here. Don't even thank me.
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
What?
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
