I do not joke in my proposal.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
You better hope there is.
You may take her now.
Your pleasures of course!
The time...is short.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Then cancel my order.
I will decide the conclusion.
Well then let us proceed.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Ahh, there is yet time.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Ahh, she will be yours.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
Ahh, but I declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
She was?
Her dance has pleased me.
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
What kind of symbol?
...And what is this?
A situation easily remedied.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Then why do you shake so?
You know better than that.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
They are live ones?
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
