Yes, sir, Master.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
Then it is some service you desire of us.
Aaaahhhh.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
Yes, Master.
Without the snake, of course.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
What do you suppose for?
He wants us.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
