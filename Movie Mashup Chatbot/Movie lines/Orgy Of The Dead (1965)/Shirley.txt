You love me then?
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
Maybe so.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
What can we do against them?
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Nothing is worth your life.
Be careful!
I'm afraid I'll faint.
What can we do?
Those creatures..!
I'm so frightened.
Look!
What do you mean?
Can't we get out of here?
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
Then..then what's that music?
It frightens me.
Where?
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
No. No! No!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
I'm so frightened.
