Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Is there time?
You mean...!
For what!?!
All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
Oh, if there is only time!
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
There are others.
I understand, Master
I would have time for my own pleasures!
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
The moon is almost gone!
When!?
Well?
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
It would seem so, Master
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
As you wish, Master
It would seem so, Master.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
A symbol, Master.
Tie them that they may watch.
But they are not yet one of us.
