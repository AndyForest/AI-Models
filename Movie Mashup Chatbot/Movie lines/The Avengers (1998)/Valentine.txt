Choices?
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
An unholy trinity ...
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Ugh ...
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
Aren't you forgetting about something?
You said ... one shot.
If you say so.
That's not playing by the rules.
You wish.
But did they teach you this?
You're better than I expected.
The last one you'll ever see.
John Steed.
