Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
We want to help...!
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Looks like rain, Steed...
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
Where?
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Mother and Father know best.
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
This man -- did you see him?
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
You.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
She may try to kill you.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Possibly. Split personality ...
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
Weather's turning nasty.
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
