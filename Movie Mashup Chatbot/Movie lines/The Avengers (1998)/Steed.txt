No need. I'll call again.
There are limits?
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Seriously?
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Our chaperon.
Not quite.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
As a matter of fact I have ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
Mrs. Peel?
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
I'll be back ...
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
You first.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
What's that you're wearing?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
You didn't tell her?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
You'll find out.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
I told Mother I took care of you.
You don't trust me?
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Winning isn't everything.
I thought you didn't.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Not for a moment.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Always.  Except ...
No trouble.
Nothing personal.
Orders.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Mrs. Peel ... ?
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Do you always drive this fast?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Is there anything that isn't?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
What on earth?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
I must say, you look more your old self --
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Did he say who?
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
Why should they think that?
I might say the same.
I wasn't about to.
Strange.
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
I meant me.
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
For a man in my position --
As per mother's instructions.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
Do you really think so?
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
I didn't. Mother did.
Much better.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
I was about to throw in the towel.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
How did you guess?
Dead, I'm afraid.
Oh, hello ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Global warming?
In your operation.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Guilty until proven innocent?
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
Impossible.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Anyone particular in mind?
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Why?
Insane ... ?
Amnesia?
Think she really killed those agents?
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
Both, actually.
She was ...
I feel sure of it.
I think so, thank you so much ...
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
You are, and it's behind you.
Did I? My mistake.
I do.
Rules are made to be broken.
One shot -- for emergencies.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
I was at Harrow ...
Perish the thought.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
