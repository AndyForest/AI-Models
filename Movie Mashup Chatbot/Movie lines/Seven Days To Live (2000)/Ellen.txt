You don't remember?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
What?
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
What are you talking about-
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
Martin, what-
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
I haven't the slightest idea.
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
In the village.  Look what I found.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Martin, it's not funny!
Someone from the village.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
I miss Tommi so much.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Cherry-red Tears.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
I just had a really strange experience.
What are you doing?
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Yes, daddy.
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
You?
Do you have a better idea?
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Do you know where fuse box is?
Hey... the fuse.
Maybe the antenna's broken.
I mean the armchair!
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Stop that!
Oh God, Tommi...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
Come on, say it.  You know...
But what is the truth?
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
I really hate to bother him, but...
Thank you.
Ellen.
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
1976.  What happened back then?
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
Do I look like it that much?
Ellen Straub.
No, I've never seen him before.
Hello.  Can I help you?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
I've killed my husband!
And that is?
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
