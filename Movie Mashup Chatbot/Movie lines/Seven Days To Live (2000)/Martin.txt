For God's sake, what happened to me?
How did you get me out of there?
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
Hi, darling.
Maybe an animal.
She was old.
What?
Who's that?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
Where have you been?
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Where have you been all day?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
So, did you sleep good?
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Who was that?
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
So do I, believe me.
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
What?
We just have to make a new beginning.
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Making our very own solstice fire.
Where are you going?
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
I'll do it myself.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Oh, damnit!
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
It still worked in town.
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
You'll never get away from me!
Ellen, move aside...
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
I have to cut his windpipe...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Why else?
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
Twenty-three, to be exact.
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
Tenth floor.
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
