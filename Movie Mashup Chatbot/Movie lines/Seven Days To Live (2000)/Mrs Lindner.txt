I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Hammer?
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
You didn't tell her!
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
Just call me Elisabeth.
