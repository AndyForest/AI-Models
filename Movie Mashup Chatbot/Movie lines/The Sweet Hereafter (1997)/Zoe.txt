Oh God, I'm scared.
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
I need money.
Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
I tested positive.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Don't you want to hear?
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Daddy?
Why can't you talk to me?
DADDY!!!
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
So what's the problem?
Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
