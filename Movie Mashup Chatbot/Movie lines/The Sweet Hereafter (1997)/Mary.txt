She's resting.  In her room.
Billy, please.  The children.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
Nicole!
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Yes.  It's a present.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
So do you like your new room?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
That's what he said.
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
No.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
