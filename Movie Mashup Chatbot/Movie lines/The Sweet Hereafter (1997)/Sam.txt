I'm sorry.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
C'mon, you know that won't...
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.
Because it's what we have to do.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
So what brings you out tonight?
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Did he say what about?
There's talk of that.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
I don't know.
Okay.
Yes.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
What do you mean?
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
Are you sleeping?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
What are you up to, Nicole?
Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families.  The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence.  He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
Do you like the colour?
Pretty slick, eh?
How do you like it, Nicole?
Don't even try to remember.
Does it fit?
What's that?
What took so long?
What's so funny?
I am.  Really.  It was awesome.
Of course.
You're going to blow everyone away.
That was great.
