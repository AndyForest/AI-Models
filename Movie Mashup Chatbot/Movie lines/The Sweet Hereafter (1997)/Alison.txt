I hope she gets better.
Say hi to Zoe.
Alison.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
What happened?
What happened?
I...don't think so.
That's okay.
What...does it turn to?
She's in trouble?
But you said...
Then...when did she get better?
So there were others?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Which one?
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
How are you?
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
