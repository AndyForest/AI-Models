Away from your crazy Mom.
It's for the school bazaar.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
You hate it.
What do you think?
Hi, Dolores.
Do you have this agreement with you?
Are you expensive?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
So you're just the thing we need.
You think someone else caused the accident?
Dolores?
Who did they get for that?
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
You've been retained?
No.
You can't come here.
Who are you?
