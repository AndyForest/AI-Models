Why did you do that, Billy?
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Because I have to.
I have to.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Good night, Billy.
You're leaving.
Just like we look forward to this.
They can look forward to that.
Your kids never cry.
Yes.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
When the game's over, I guess.
No.  It should be dry by now.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Have you been waiting long?
Can't you make it later?
Billy, that's too early.
No.
Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Crafts.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Yes.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
There's the Prescots...
What do you mean?
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
She...she was a friend of mine.
Will you be spending more than a night?
You don't know that.
The Ottos.
But Charlene...
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
