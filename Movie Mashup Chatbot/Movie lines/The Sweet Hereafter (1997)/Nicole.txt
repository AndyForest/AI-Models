Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Oh.  Right.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
I don't know.
It just seems...kind of weird.
Are you sure?
Okay.
Was it good?
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
It's the truth.
No.  What's this lawyer business?
Who's Mr. Stephens?
From you?
Is this mine?
I feel like a princess.
It's interesting.
How was it?
And winter?
What happened to summer?
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
Should I keep reading?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Yes.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
That's right.
What, Mason?
Okay.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Yes.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
It's like a song.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
It was snowing.
Why?
Dolores.
You seem very sure about that.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
I won't lie.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
No.
Yes.
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
Positive.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Dolores was driving too fast.
Yes, I understand.
I was scared.
Before the actual accident?
Yes.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Yes.
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.
No.
Until the accident?  No.  Yes, there was.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Yes.
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Yes.
Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
She'll move away.
Will the police do anything to her?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Great.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
Great.
No.
As opposed to this T.V.?
Nothing.
How will he do that?
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
But you didn't lose me.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
The door needs a lock.
It's okay.
Very slick.
The ramp?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Nothing.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
You mean it?
Really?
