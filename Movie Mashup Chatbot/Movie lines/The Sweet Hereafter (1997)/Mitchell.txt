I'll tell her that.
I will.
Alison.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
I'm...so sorry.
It turns to steaming piss.
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
She didn't.
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Which clinic?
Which one?
Are you still in touch?
Yes...fine.
We're...not together.
Ally Jones.
And what does he do again?
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
Ally.  That's right.
Yes.
Alison Jones.
I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
I can help you.
I understand.
My name is...
Why would he be frightened?
That's what he said, is it?
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
Yes.
Excuse me?
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
I did.
Yes.  He does.
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
That would complicate things.
What's that, Dolores?
Did they give him special care?
Did his parents attend to that?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
And what's that?
Berry-picking.
Berries.
You talked about it?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
From what?
For rabbits?
And they loved Bear.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
I'll...take it straight.
No.  A little sugar though.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
I'm absolutely positive.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I don't want you to lie.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
You hate that.
I have no questions.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
I object to that form of question. Note that.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Have they ever been busted?
Crafts?
What do they do?
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
Indian?
Tell me about the Ottos.
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
People who will help our cause.
That's the local bar?
When?
What about Doreen?
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
Do you have a room?
Here we go.
Is this it?
How old is she?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Need a hand?
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
Do you have the blood test?
What for?
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
Yes.
Yes.
That's not news, Zoe.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
News?
Yes.
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
Yes.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
I'm in a car wash.
Well, let's see what we get.
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Is there shrimp on it?
What is it?
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
No.
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
Excuse me?
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
Yes.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Please.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
I'm a lawyer.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
How does the family survive?
Any criminal record?
In what way?
No.
