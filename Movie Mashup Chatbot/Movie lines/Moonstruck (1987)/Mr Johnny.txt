I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
And I'll have the special fish.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
You haven't said anything.
I don't know what you mean.
I have my eyes open.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
What?
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
I must ask for that back.
If I marry you my mother will die.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
We should talk alone.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
He's my younger brother.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
Yeah.
Alright. A month. In a month.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
Seven-thirty.
I like this ring.
Alright.
This is a good suit.
On the floor?
I don't understand.
What do you mean?
Yes?
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
Have Something.
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
Never is a long time.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Maybe you're right.
No?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
You don't know where Loretta is?
I don't know.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
Who was that?
Yes.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
My mother's recovered.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
Maybe I should go?
It's late.
Where is she?
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
I came right from the airport.
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
It was a miracle!
Of course I want to.
Have you come to make peace with me?
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Loretta...
