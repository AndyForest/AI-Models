Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
And go to confession.
I want you to stop seeing her.
Have I been a good wife?
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
You're welcome.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Cosmo?
Where you been?
Why you drinking so much?
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
Who's dead?
Oh God, that's too bad.
Do you love him, Loretta?
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
It was a miracle.
She recovered.
No more he's not.
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
No. But I have a hangover.
Are you drunk?
Your hair's different.
What the hell happened to you?
A wife knows.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Where you been?
Did he tell her?
How's the mother?
No. He don't.
And we'll sell the house.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
So we'll sell the house.
Why not?
Will you live here?
And who's gonna pay for that?
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Okay, I'll tell her.
No idea.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
That's it! That's the reason!
But why would a man need more than one woman?
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
That's incredible.
You're kidding?
A miracle. Well, that's news.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
Yes.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
So.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Come on in.
Moving in?
Good night.
Sure.
Good night.
I'm too old for you.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Sure.
What you don't know about women is a lot.
I think it's because they fear death.
Why do men chase women?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
I'm a housewife.
Don't shit where you eat.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
That woman was a student of yours?
What do you do?
Will you join me for dinner?
None of your business.
She was just too young for you.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
