A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Okay.
Yes.
His brother.
I'm going to bed now.
Thank you, Rose.
What?
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
Rita. Pass the wine.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I won't pay for nothing.
I have no money!
I don't like him.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Rose, pass the wine.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't wanna talk about it.
And that's how much I'm saying.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
Hi.  Hi.
Alright. I didn't see you here.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Who is this man? You're engaged!
What are you doing here?
What'd you do to your hair?
Let's go tell your Mother.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
He did?
Maybe.
I didn't give you away the first time.
I won't come.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
What killed him?
You did this once it didn't work out.
Again?
What's your news?
Ti amo.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Bed.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
I brought you something.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
