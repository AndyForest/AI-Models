Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
Will you marry me.
Loretta?
Loretta, what are you talking about?
No, I'll tell him.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Is Johnny here?
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
No.
No.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
I was.
Why?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right.
We're here.
I'm here!
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
You're making me feel guilty again.
What's the matter?
Yeah. It smells like snow.
What do you want to do now?
I think that's it.
Yeah.
Awful?
It's the best thing there is.
Come on.
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
Thank you!
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Thank you.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Hi.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
But he wants me to come!
I'll come to the wedding.
I can't!
I'm in love with you!
I can't do that!
What?
Oh no I didn't!
You ruined my life.
What did you do?
She didn't like me.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
Don't just become excited.
Take it easy.
What?
It makes you look like an angel.
It's so bright.
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
What?
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
What about Johnny?
I've got you.
Loretta.
Your blood.
I was dead.
I can't believe what is happening.
To the bed.
Son of a bitch!
A bride without a head!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
Stop it!
What are you doing!
I'm a wolf?
You don't know nothing about it.
Yes.
She was right to leave me.
Why you talking to me?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Stupid yourself.
How many men since then?
When your husband get hit by the bus?
No.
I don't know.
Why?
When you get engaged?
Fast.
How'd he die?
Where'd Johnny find you?
This is good. Uhh...
I like it well done.
You don't have to help me.
Loretta. What's that smell?
I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
That's it.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancï¿½ saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
I have no life.
You are going to marry my brother?
Why?
Have you come from my brother?
What's wrong can never be made right.
Why didn't he call himself?
Yeah, this is Ronny.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
I'm sure she did.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Good.
Johnny...
