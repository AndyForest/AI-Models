No. You were there.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
We just come from the bank.
Hi, Loretta.
You gotta date?
Oh.
Did you see it?
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
I knew she had it.
Oh. Right.
You see that moon last night?
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
I don't know.
Cosmo.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
It's Cosmo's moon.
Look.
Rita. Rita.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
