THX and me.
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
I thought you were through with it!
What?
But you can't...you.
When?.....How?
What?
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
I want you for my roommate.
Why are you so concerned?
What?
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled...
