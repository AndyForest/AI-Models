No!...No!...
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
It's the end.
no...no, no.
No one can see us now we're alone.
They don't know.
Are you all right?
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
What are you doing?
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
What?
You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
I'll try.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
What time is it?
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
Looks like food.
Look, food!
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
I've never been under the table before.
I haven't done anything.
Then why did you bring it up?
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
Don't go.
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
Now?
When?
What did you get?
You know I don't feel well.
What's this?  Why did you change it?
What's the matter with you?
I'm not hungry.
Look!
Right now.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
Get out of here, Leave me alone.
I'll report you.  It's....
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
I don't feel well.
You're in violation.
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
Where's LUH?
What's going on?
Why did you have LUH come here?
Where is LUH?
I thought of something.....
What do you want?
No...no you're wrong.
Where's LUH?
You don't know that!
She's not there
That's not it.
Shut up.
I knew him.
No!....
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
I don't care.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
What kind of answer is that?
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
We've lost SEN!
How do you know?
Which way?
...and you're not lost now?
What are you doing here?
You should know better than that!
...to me.  I think I'm dying.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
