THX!
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
They're watching us now.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
AH UGH.
Don't let them separate us.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
You don't know.  You don't....
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
I don't know.
I don't want to lose you.
But...you...
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
No....I though  I'm afraid.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
Don't take anything.
No!  Don't go.
It's 3+27 hundred
What?
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Looks like dirt.
Look,dirt!
Don't be so sure.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
I have to... he's a G-34
I don't know.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Now.
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Eat your dinner.
You've seen enough.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
