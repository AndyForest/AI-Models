What do I got for you?
Of course I'm on it.
Yeah, I can.
Look it up.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
What are you doing?
Good.  How's it going?
What's wrong with it?
She's good.
Yeah.
How many?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
Like this?
