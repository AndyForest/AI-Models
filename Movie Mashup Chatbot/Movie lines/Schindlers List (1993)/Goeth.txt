Where are the guards?
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
You did, but you didn't.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
Yeah, sure.
You're not telling me something.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
You want these people.
I don't know.  Soon.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
He's important to my business.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
Scherner told me something else about you.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
They're not gone, they're here.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
We started without you.
