Right.
Right.
Good. So what do you think?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
Good.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
And who is she?
And what's she like between the sheets?
Fuck you, too --
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Should blow you away, you know that?
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Who'd you think it was?
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
You sure about that?
Why do you want to do that for?
What?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
You OK about that?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
And do you know why?
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Are you all there?
So he knows your name?
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
What the fuck is this?
It's your decision.
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
You sure?
So?
Why would you do that?
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Give me the fucking shooter!
Give me the shooter, Jude --
That fucker's dead --
That true, Fergus? You in love?
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
