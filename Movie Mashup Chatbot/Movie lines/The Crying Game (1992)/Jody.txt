What?
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
Got to catch me first --
What you say, faster?
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
Faster than cricket?
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Tell me something, anything.
What does that mean?
Yeah?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
A story.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
Help me.
I'm sorry.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Take her picture. C'mere.
See if she's all right.
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
If they kill me --
Want you to do something, Fergus.
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Some kinds of women are...
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
It's as simple as that?
What do you believe in?
I've often wondered how you do it.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
We got simple tastes, you and me.
My special friend.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Like having a pint in the Metro --
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Jody's always right.
See? I was right about you.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
Fergus?
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Now put it back in.
These things take time, Fergus.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Tree.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Never.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Best game in the world.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Can't. Once I signed up.
I got sent.
What the fuck am I doing here.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
Don't I know it.
Suppose you could say that.
Absolutely not.
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
My inside pocket.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
C'mere.
She's not my type.
I didn't even fancy her.
And you know the funny thing?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
Not in your nature.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
You want to bet?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
Kill me.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Hey --
So I've noticed.
Could you?
No. It's the truth.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Only joking.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
I can smell her perfume.
Thank you, handsome.
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
I seen your fucking face.
This is a farce, man.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
Can't.
Fuck you.
He believes in the future --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
Have you no feelings, woman?
Nice lady.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Whatever you say, Jude...
I never know nothing.
Who gives a fuck.
And you know what?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
What if I did?
Don't run off, Jude.
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
