Fucking men, Col --
Fuck it, is what I say.
You see that, Col?
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
He's back, Col
Ask him.
Maybe he wants something.
Good thing in a man.
He's still looking, Col.
Hi, Jimmy.
What do you think his name is?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
What would you call it?
What you think?
Just cut his hair, you know.
He gave me a look.
See that, Col?
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Fuck off, Dave.
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Take your clothes.
Sure, Dave --
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
Charming.
See, they get the wrong idea.
Maybe.
Jimmy.
Thank you.
You heard me --
Did I?
Fuck off, Dave.
What's that supposed to mean?
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Meet Col --
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Promise?
Will I see you again?
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Do I?
Tell me what she wore.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
What happened to Jimmy?
What's Fergus?
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
And you'll never leave me?
Say it again.
What would you do for me?
You do?
Then say it.
Tell me you love me.
Love me.
More endearments.
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
You like me now, Jimmy?
Let them come then.
Try and go, then.
Why?
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
You tried.
You didn't.
You killed my Jody
It was you...
You killed my Jody?
Died...
Yes.
You knew my Jody?
You knew my Jody?
You knew which man?
Don't go like that.
Jimmy?
I will be.
Only in times of extreme stress.
Prescription. For my condition.
My pills...
You mean that?
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
So tell me.
No! I'm going home...
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
I'm going home!
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
For you...
Why?
Sorry. What you doing?
You like me better like this.
So it's true, then?
You want to make me look like him...
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You promise?
And you wouldn't leave me?
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Why?
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
You want another haircut, baby?
Afraid so.
Anything.
Do you like me even a little bit?
What you doing, Jimmy?
And you're not going to tell me more?
She from Scotland too?
She own you, Jimmy?
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
It's her, isn't it?
You following me?
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
You gonna tell me why?
Why, honey --
Okay.
Not at all, honey.
He'd bring me carnations.
Delirious.
Only if you kiss me.
Don't be cruel.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Please, Jimmy.
A little.
Stop it, Jimmy.
Are you pretending yet?
Absolutely.
You can always pretend.
Probably.
Sorry.
All right, they do.
Details, baby, details.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Know what, honey?
When?
Ask to meet me again.
Make it up to me, then.
That's a start.
I know that.
Nothing's wise.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Made me feel all funny inside.
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
You mean that?
Do you care, Jimmy?
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Never said a truer word.
Apologies, my sweet.
Sorry, darling.
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Where?
Tell him it hurt --
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Even now.
All the time.
Told you, I'm superstitious.
Why?
What you thinking of, hon?
No, depends on nothing.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Can't leave me now.
I'm superstitious. Drink.
Drink.
Why?
You mean that?
What does that mean?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
He did sometimes.
Is this an obsession of yours?
I am.
A real gentleman...
But you can t stay, you know that?
Like you're concerned.
You say that like a gentleman.
What do you think?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
That's good...
Are you jealous of him?
You want to know how I kissed him?
No --
Yes.
No.
As different as it's possible to be.
He was different.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Jesus fucking Christ.
What'll it be?
Would you like a drink?
I'm not on my own, am I?
Piss off, Dave!
The things a girl has to put up with.
Jesus.
You want one?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
I wonder.
They're jealous.
The one you gave me in the Metro.
Give me that look again.
Half-five. At Millie's.
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
You want me to ask you in, right?
You can't leave me then, can you?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
You know.
He wants me to perform for him.
Yes, thank you.
They all get the wrong idea.
Hi.
You old-fashioned?
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
Everybody wants something.
Jimmy?
He's Scottish, Col.
Don't know. Who is she?
That should make her happy.
Like treacle.
The accent, I suppose.
Scottish?
Not English.
You American?
What's it to you?
What's his name?
Who?
Someone recommend you?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
You know her, Jimmy?
Carnations.
