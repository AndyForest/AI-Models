She's not a girl, Col --
How?
I'm sorry.
Then why doesn't she?
So who's he?
Thanks.
Is that good or bad?
Yeah.
It's a simple question.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
What?
She's not that either.
She's not a tart.
Do you mean that?
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Please, Dil --
Fergus.
Thirty-five.
Stop it, Dil --
Don't call me that --
Yes. Say hello to Col --
The Metro.
I promise.
You will, Dil
Not if you go.
Yes. Now.
You've got to go now, Dil --
Can't remember...
Yes.
She was --
Dil!!!
It's my name, Dil --
Fergus.
Never.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Anything.
Yeah.
Love you, Dil.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Yes.
I like you, DIl
More what?
I like you, Dil --
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
Got to be somewhere.
Let me go, Dil
Stop it, Dil --
He asked me to see were you all right.
Okay.
Don't you want to kill me?
I suppose I tried.
No.
In a manner of speaking.
Did you hear me?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
Are you listening?
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
Your soldier.
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
What?
Good-bye, Dil
Are you all right, Dil?
Are you supposed to take that many?
What condition?
What pills?
You heard what I said, Dil?
Yes.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
I was trying to get out of something.
Come on...
I had to go to work!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
Look on it like a honeymoon.
For me.
Don't call me that --
Yes.
What?
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
I'm sorry.
I promise.
No.
Yes.
It's a secret.
Want to change you to a man, Dil...
You said anything, Dil
No. Sit down.
You got the keys to the shop?
You'd do anything for me?
You do something for me, Dil?
More than that.
I'm not sure.
I can't.
You could say that.
Yes.
Shouldn't be, Dil
Kind of.
What's her?
Dil, this is Jude.
Not here.
No.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't.
So I got it wrong, then.
What?
Happy now?
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Should have stayed a girl.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Don't ask me in.
Sorry.
Am I becoming repetitious?
There's Dave. He knew too.
I'm working on it.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Kind of wish I didn't.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Don't.
So they do know.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Do they know?
Whenever. Tonight.
Will you meet me again?
How?
So I'm sorry.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
I didn't mean to hit you.
You think that's wise?
I said stop it.
Shut up.
Yeah. I care, Dil.
Sure I do.
You could?
Must be.
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
Give it over, Dil --
Don't call me that.
What you doing here?
Come on, Dil --
I have to talk to her, Col --
Dil --
No...
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
I'm thinking of your man.
Depends what it is.
Aha.
What is this?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Yeah.
Something I heard someone say once.
Want to look after you.
Did he dance with you?
Maybe.
Did he come here too?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Didn't think I could.
Do I?
I think you do.
Do you miss him?
What would he think?
Maybe.
Yes...
Did you do that to him?
Shouldn't I go?
Tell me about him.
How different?
He lived here with you?
Must be in love to manage that.
Someone out there.
Whiskey.
Yes, please.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
That Dave?
Jesus Christ!
How special?
Must be.
Like what?
Why?
What's that about?
What look?
Where?
No, I didn't --
He's getting up.
You on the game?
Perform?
What was that all about?
You all right?
What was that?
Hi. You forgot your bag.
Must be.
Not me.
Jimmy.
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Who's she?
And what's it like?
How'd you guess?
No.
No.
Nothing.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
Guy I work with.
In a way.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Need to go across the water.
That's wise, Tommy.
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Dil!
I take pride in my work.
Who's the old geezer?
Jude?
You may be right.
And what if you don't?
And what happens then?
Was I?
And what if I say no?
And then you'll leave her out of it?
Of course. I forgot.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
She's nobody. She likes me.
Leave her out of this.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
What do you mean?
No, what is the thing?
Yes.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
Suits you.
I know.
I heard.
Leave me alone, Jude.
He's hot.
Leave us, Judie.
Tough work, that.
You don't know that.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Have a look at him.
Did you give him it?
Hey -- what's he like?
See does he want some.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
So it's on the street.
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Hope not.
Thank God for that.
Who is he?
A hotel?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Just a girl.
Definitely unusual.
I understand.
I know that.
He's at home.
I thought it was Dave.
So it was you all the time.
I'm sure.
Would make me feel better about it.
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Peter.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Why?
Yes.
Back in a minute, Jody
I told him.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
Thanks.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Give him a cup of tea.
Hurling --
Hurling --
I said you bastard -- stop --
You stupid bastard --
You won't run.
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
The fastest.
Stop that talk now --
Why?
No.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Nothing.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
When I was a child...
Like the one about the frog?
What?
Go to sleep now.
How can I?
Don't.
Stop it --
I told you not to talk that way --
I don't know her.
Don't think that way.
What?
Don't know her.
You liked her?
She can't help it.
I didn't.
Is it bad?
Yes.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Depends on what you believe in.
We don't look on it like that.
Do you?
The best.
Oh, yeah.
Who's Dil?
Having two pints in the Rock.
Like what?
Having a pint in the Rock.
Doesn't matter where.
Don't be so sure.
Why?
So what's that supposed to mean?
Yeah?
Shut up, would you?
Give us a break.
Hurry up, would you?
Can't.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
My pleasure, Jody
I'll bear that in mind.
How different?
The fastest.
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
And you play cricket?.
Shouldn't take it personally.
Why did you sign up?
You could have said no.
What the fuck were you doing here?
What?
She's a friend of mine
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You make a nice couple.
She your wife?
No?
Why not?
She'd be anyone's type.
What?
No.
Didn't look like that to me...
No, what's the funny thing?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
What the fuck do you know about my people?
What do you know about my nature?
Why can't we?
I'm not a gambling man.
They won't let him die.
What makes you think that?
Do what?
What is it now?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Well, I could say the same about you.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No?
What's that?
No fucking way.
Can't we take it off?
How did you know it was her?
My pleasure.
Am I?
So, what do I look like?
How is it a farce?
What do you mean you can't?
Eat something, would you?
Yeah.
