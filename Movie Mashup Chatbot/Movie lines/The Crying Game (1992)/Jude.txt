Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
What was it?
Lucky you.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
I sincerely hope so.
You a handyman, Fergie?
Some judge...
Yes?
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Perfect.
You were made for this.
You know what. Go.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Och, you do, Fergie.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
You're never out, Fergus.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
So you did fuck up.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Eddie and Tinker died.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
My pleasure.
Someone's got to do it.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
He's all right.
Can't.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Horny bastard.
Do you want some food?
I said shut the fuck up --
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
You shut your face --
It was fun while it lasted.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
Come and get me, soldier --
People. They could be looking.
You never know.
Not here.
Tell me, Jody
You didn't?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
You don't know me, do you?
The teddy bear?
You're crazy --
No, we are.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
