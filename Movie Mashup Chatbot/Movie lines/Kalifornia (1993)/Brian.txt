Adele for god sake please lis...
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
I suppose anything's possible.
No.
What happened to Adele?
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
...Ha.
If you say so.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Yeah?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Sure.
Yeah.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Dahlia, no.
That bad?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Who?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
How much do I owe you?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
So what do you do Early?
Brian.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
Tight fit.
I don't know.
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
Carrie, watch for Early.
Then try again,
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
Carrie... stop it.
Why, what did he do?
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
There's more...
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
What is it?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
How do you know that?
Who said he's my good buddy?
Take your time.
All set?
Carrie.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
I heard that.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Lighten up...
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
I like that.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
...and I think I know why.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
...just like that?
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
...I do.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
A... I gotta go.
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
