...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
What?
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
Jeez... Adele!
...Anything else?
What's Early been in jail for?
Yeah.
Adele... are you serious?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Hold still.
That's me.
Took 'em all.
Sure.
It's a portfolio of my work.
I'm cool.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
How'd you meet Early?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
He whips you?
So you don't do any of those things.
You dropped this.
...Yeah, sure.
Not really.
...Yeah.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Karma.
...Thank you.
...Pardon?
Carrie.
What about you?
What are you going to do?
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
Brian I want him out of our car!
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
I'm finished.
What's that?
Look again!
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Fuck!
I don't want to talk about it.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Up yours.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Funny, very funny.
I still think we should have met them first.
What did he sound like on the phone?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
A book on the warehouse murders?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Why?
So how's it going?
Thanks. What are you doing?
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
The party?
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Thank god!
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Not yet.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...You're hurting me...
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Early, just think...
Siesta.
No, never. Excuse me.
No.
...Brian hurt his foot.
No, thanks, I can manage.
Where's Adele?
