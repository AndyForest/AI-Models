There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
You lose!
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
That's not true!
...That's not true.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Carryin' a gun.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Do what?
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
No it is not!
You took this picture?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
What's this?
Could I try that?
You can?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Is it hard to learn?
Are you takin' the pictures?
That French ain't it?
What?
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
...I said, I like your hair.
Hi, I'm Adele.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Early! Stop!!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
...I don't know.
...thank you.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Early, what're you doin'?
Early, sing me a song.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
What if they're dangerous?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
What'll we do out there?
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Almost.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Early, you are so sweet.
