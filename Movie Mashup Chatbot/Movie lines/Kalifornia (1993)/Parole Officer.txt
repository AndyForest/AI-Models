You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
...Diebold?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Could be.
His Parole Officer.
What happened?
