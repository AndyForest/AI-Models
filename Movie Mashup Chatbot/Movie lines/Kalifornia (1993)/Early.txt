Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
What's wrong with her?
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Yeah but, what is it?
What the hell is this stuff?
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Shush, Adele.
As many times as it takes.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
I heard that.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Happy birthday Adele.
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
What do you need a Bible for?
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Where you from Walter?
I don't know. Wish I did.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
What's your name, boy?
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
You two been busy in here.
...and?
So tell me... what happened here?
Hell it don't...  ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
Damn right I do.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
Nah... how much money have you got?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
You wanna hear mine?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Now why is that?
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
...Then some.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
Henry Lucas.
This guy killed a mess of people.
This the book your writing?
Forget it.
Can't hurt.
...Too bad.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Best kind.
...You know what I mean?
You were plenty hot.
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Everybody just shut up!
Shut your mouth.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
...never?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...Need a hand with those bags?
She wasn't feeling so good.
Bri'.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
What is it?
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Wasn't my fault...
