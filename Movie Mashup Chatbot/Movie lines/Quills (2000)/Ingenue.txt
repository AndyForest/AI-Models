What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Was ever a man more risqu�? He wants to take me every way!
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou�!
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
