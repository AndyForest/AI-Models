We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
How is the patient faring?
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
HER NAME, ABBE.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
You'd suffer in her stead?
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
He'll do no such thing.
What could cause a tincture like this?
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
No. It most certainly was not.
Of course.
Oh indeed?
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
And --?
Well?
And place my reputation at stake?
You find this amusing, do you?
You're a sentimental man.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
Do you favor its publication?
Well...?
And his writing?
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
And he's never once attempted escape?
His wife's?
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
It's a formality; truly.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben�; I look to the future.
Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delben�?
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben�. Mine is a higher mission.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
This is neither the time nor the place --
Good God, Marquise --
Of course.
And I in yours.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
-- words alone are insufficient.
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
I pray you: be succinct.
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
Doesn't that please you?
Do as I say.
Leave at once --
