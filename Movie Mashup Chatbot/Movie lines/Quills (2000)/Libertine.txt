I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
