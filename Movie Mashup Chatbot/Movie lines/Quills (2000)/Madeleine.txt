If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
He's a writer, not a madman.
Once or twice.
No one's forcing you to listen.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
You'll hate me now, won't you?
What? What've I done?
Why not?
Mother's not half so blind as you.
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Ow!
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Yes, Abbe?
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
I'll be waiting.
I'll pass the word on, then.
Here it is; the last chapter.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
"Well worth the dig!"
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
"A habituï¿½ of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
...yes, I've got that bit...
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
They've taken your clothes?
I don't believe it!
What have they done to you now?
What's that then?
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
It's a long story, this one.
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
Is it terribly erotic?
Is it awfully violent?
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
There's something else I want from you.
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Don't start --
