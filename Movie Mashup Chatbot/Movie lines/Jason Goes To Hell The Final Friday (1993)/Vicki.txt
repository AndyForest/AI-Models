Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Why didn't you tell me?
She's yours?
She's beautiful.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
A pizza?!
I'm literally going to kill you!
Steven!
That's disgusting.
I mean really never.
Never.
