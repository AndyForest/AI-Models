-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
Skin stretcher was human.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
I know everything about you, Diana.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Twenty.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
I need to talk to you.
Yes.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Sorry.
For a good reason.
That's what I'd like to know.
That's very colorful, chief.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
