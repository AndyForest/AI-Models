I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
Don't do anything stupid.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
Yeah...
Have a good night.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
I'm now begging you.
Oh my God, Steven.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
What are you doing?
It was a community service.
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
