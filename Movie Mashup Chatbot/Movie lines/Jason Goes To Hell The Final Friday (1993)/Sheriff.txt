June the 19th.
What's the problem here?
Okay, I'll call you later.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Steven buggin' you?
Legs giving you trouble?
Everything going okay?
Lock this asshole up.
Tell me!
Tell me.
Why did you want her body?
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Goddamnit!
You're talking about my lady.
Get up!
Maybe you should be moving on.
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
-- Bad?!
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
About what?
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
You don't know shit!
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
Until I hear the truth.
Oh, my dear God...
