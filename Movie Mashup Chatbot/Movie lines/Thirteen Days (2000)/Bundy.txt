Says what, Kenny?
Yeah.
You know I don't mean they're weak.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
Cuba.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
