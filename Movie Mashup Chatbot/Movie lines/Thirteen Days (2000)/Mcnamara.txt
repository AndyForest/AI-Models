And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
Starshells.
What --
Admiral, I asked you a question.
What are you doing?
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
