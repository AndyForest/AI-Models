This is about Cuba.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Deal.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I want an hour with him.
How's my favorite President?
