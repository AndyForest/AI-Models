The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Still heading for Cuba.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
