Yes, sir.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
