It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
