But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
But why would they do that...?
Two what...?
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
Then what is he...?
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
Then you wear it.
I don't want it.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
He made that quite clear, yes.
I want to see my mother.
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
You - are - a - murderer.
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
ENOUGH!!!
Stop it!
It wes a dream...!
'He'...?
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
You're a monster.
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
Better than most, I suppose.
The lamplight.  That's all.
Eighty million doll --- ?
I don't want the -
There are things I have to know!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
Who the hel1 -
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
My...mother...?
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
Who is this...?
I beg your par---
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
Hello...?  Who is this...?
He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down!
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
He just went out like & light-
FAST.
Anybody got a BP yet...?
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
Oh god...
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
No!
I don't know what you are!!!
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
Leave me alone!
Only you...
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
I love Michael...
But have I...?  Ever...?!
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
I know that you're evil.
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
I LOVE him!
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
It's too soon to know.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
Go away!  I don't want you here.
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
You're very clever, aren't you...?
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
To love, you must be able to feel.
Made it...?
You bastard...
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
STOP!
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
Lie...?
I know.    you are my son -
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
You bastard!
Stop it!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
I can't.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
Hi.
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Go ahead.
What were you talking about...?
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
A bit much.    Lucas.
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
You alright...?
I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
- we made a fire.
Talking to me dear...?
That's not funny.
That's cause we're below sea level.
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
Michael!
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Mm-hmm...
Mm-hmm...
Mm-hmmm...
Dropped it.
A little wine...?
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
That's GREAT!
And I thought I was the mindreader.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
You sure...?
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
Do you love me, Michael...?
I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
She - she said I - I was a ---
You know...?
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
We're quite a pair, you and I.
You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
Stop it.
I'm serious.  You don't -
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Captain's orders.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
You still feel that crazy...?
And whose houses do you design...?
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
What else did you see- Michael...?
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
Yessssss...
HARDER!
Harder...
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
Just one.  The bar's closed.
What do you see...?
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
I'm glad you're around to say it.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
Is that what you were doing...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
I like him.  He can stay.
He's got great hands.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
Rowan Mayfair.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
Papers...?
