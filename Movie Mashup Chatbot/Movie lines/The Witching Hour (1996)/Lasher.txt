Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
I do not understand...
What is wrong...?
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Then help me--- for his sake...
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
Do not tell me that!
But I could understand. I want to understand!
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
A girl...?
From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
If that were true, I would not be here.
There is no one here but the dead.
I bring her flowers too.
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
nan
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
If you knew how I yearn for that...
It is from love.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
Always loved you..
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
Like this...?
There are things you will not tell him.
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
