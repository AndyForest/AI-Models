Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
