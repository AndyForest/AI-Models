Huh?
Oh, that phone call...
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
No, you can't come in.
What do you want?
Somebody called you?
I don't get it.
Huh?
Yeah?
Don't!
I said open the door.
Open it.
A what?
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
Open the door.
What's to keep them from prying open the door?
No, Edgar Allen.
Ever read any Poe?
Makes me nervous.
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
Something's weird.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
How many more do we have after this?
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
Not an option.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
What?
Why?
I'm sorry.
He WILL.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He'll do something.
On it!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
I saw something, I saw...
Close it!
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Shhh...
Got him!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Morse code?
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
I'm here.  I'm here.
I am.  I'm here.
I don't know, why?
What am I, a five year old?
Don't though.
Little bit.  Yeah.
Oh, please.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Fuck.
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house.
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
"What we want is in that room."
Chills?
Shaky?
Feel okay?
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Wait.
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Can't hear a thing.
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
Damn it!
What?!
He's going down.
People.  In the house.
Don't.
478...
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
Well, I know that now.
Got us in here, didn't I?
