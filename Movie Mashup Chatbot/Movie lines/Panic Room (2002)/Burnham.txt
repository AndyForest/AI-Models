FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
Not that one.
Bullshit.
Get the fuck away from me.
-- posed to mean?
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
That's your problem.
She's gonna handle it.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
Are you gonna open the safe?
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
The hell does she want?
Are you okay?
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
I can't just...
This is ridiculous...
I can't...
I can't.
What?  What do you want me to do?
Please...
Yes.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Me.  I am.
Stop it!  Stop it!
The fuck did you do that for?!
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
God.
She didn't.
Peace out.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Not with me.  Not with people.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
I mean it!
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
What about us?
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Hey.
Cell phone.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
They're gonna die in there!
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
I did.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
Pure idiot.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
The fuck did you bring a gun for?
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Where did you get this clown?
Asshole.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Unless Daddy comes back later.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
Who is this guy?
You're an idiot.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
This was your department, Junior.
Keep your voice down.
I know.
