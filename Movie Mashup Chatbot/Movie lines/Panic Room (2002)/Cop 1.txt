The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
You don't look so good.
Can we come in?
We'd like to come in.
Can we come in?
'Bout four o'clock.
Everything okay?
