And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
How good's your intelligence?
What did he find?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
Yes.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
