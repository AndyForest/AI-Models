I have to talk to you.
What are you going to do?
Is it over?
Yes.  We've all got to let go.
You're pressuring yourself...
Joe...  Joe...
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Not if you don't grow up...
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Well, then what are you doing here?
And it's over...?
You're talking like a drunk.
Isn't there something you...
Yes.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you want me to go...?
...and is that serious?
What happened...?
Is this a bad time.
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Maybe what?
And are they going to get it?
I think I will.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Laura.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Yes. It was, actually.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
And what are you? A cop?
The TV didn't work.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Still looking.
Me, too.
Huh.
The Big Boy did...?
Yes.
Should I?
How'm I doing so far?
