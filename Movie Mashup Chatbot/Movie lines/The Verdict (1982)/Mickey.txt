It's a common medical term.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
She getting good care over there?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Why is that?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
We got to talk.
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
...four years ago...
...yeah... good...
The broad has disappeared...
The 'History'...?
What did she do?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
...one of the other nurses?
Read me what she said.
The Doctors.
Yeah. I'm awake.
I think we tried that. The case is over.
You use their witness.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
How are you holding up?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Yeah? How's our new witness?
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
What happened, Joey...?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Today is Tuesday. What?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
Been a long time, huh...?
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
You got a good memory, Franky.
Right.
Right.
No.
...Gruber's not bad.
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Who have we got?
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
What?
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Are you out of your mind...?
Don't touch anything.
What do you want?
...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
