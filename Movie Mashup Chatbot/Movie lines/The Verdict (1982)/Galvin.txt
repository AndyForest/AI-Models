Ah. How did they treat you?
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Mr. Abraham...
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
And no one will know the truth.
Yes. It would be.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
You thought it was just.
How did you settle on the amount?
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
This is going to drive the ante up.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
You know what that would mean?
...he wants to testify...?
Gruber...
...yes. Get her on the phone...
What are you doing here?
Objection!
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
It's all right, Mickey.
Hold on a second.
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
I completely understand...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Yes... I... yes.
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
No, you did fine.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
Dr. Thompson...?
Thank you.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
And you wrote that...
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Thank you...
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
The most respected...
Do you know who her doctors were?
I'm sorry...?
Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
Yes.
Yes.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
Dr. Gruber...
A single hour.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
One hour.
What did she say?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Kathy Price...
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
Yes.
Mrs...
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Four. You're great with these kids.
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Hi. How are you doing?
Exception!
I object, your Honor...
Nothing further, your Honor...
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
What?
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Ready, your Honor.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
I had a witness disappear on me.
I need an extension for my case.
Thank you for seeing me.
I'm sure you would.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
...things change.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I was held up.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Call the A.M.A.  ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse...
Thank you.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
No.
No... no...
Stop pressuring me...
What is that to you...?
It's over!
You, you don't under...
If I don't 'grow up...'
Is there going to be a later...?
And what makes you so tough?
Who told you that?
I...
I... do you want me to leave?
Yes.
That's what I am.
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
Do you think it's my fault?
You're going to stay here...?
I've got to work.
No, no, I'm just...
I've got to work...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
What...?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
Maybe I can do something right.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Really. How wonderful for you.
I'm a lawyer.
What Hotel are you staying at?
Why?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
D'you find an apartment?
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Pardon?
This is Miss Costello...?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Hello, I'm calling from...
Let me talk to Mickey.
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
Mr. Alito, please.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Then why don't you testify?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Who are you protecting, then?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
You know what happened.
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
Yes.
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
...I understand...
...I understand...
...fifty thousand dollars?
Yes. Yes, I have.
...I know. I went...
...I'm sure you do...
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
It's locked?
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
Where is he?
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Dr. Gruber.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Well, well, well. Huh?
I want to buy you a drink.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
I don't want a mistrial.
I don't know.
What are you doing in New York...?
What the hell are you doing here?
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
The Hospital...?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat...
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
Uh... the admitting nurse...
What difference can that make...? All right...
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
Are you with me... are you awake...?
That's right.
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
Yeah.
I'm swell.
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I can't talk now.
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Oh shit, what's today?
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
They still have to take it to a jury.
So what?
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm going to get laid.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Admittance form is wrong.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
...I have to stand up for her...
...he's a good man...
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
Mick. Mick. Mick...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
I'm going to help her.
...I'm going to need your help...
Come on. Let's get a drink.
I have to talk to you.
...hey, I don't need your charity...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
...now who is that...?
Uh...
Hi, Mickey...
What?
I just saw her.
She told me.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Huh. And why is that?
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
What happened in those three minutes...?
What happened in those three...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
...of the procedures...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Dr. Towler...
