Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Look -- it ticks!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
You've had plenty of time already!
Dorothy!
Now come on - you're acting silly --
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
And him a brain.
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
And bears!
We might.
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Oh - I'll get it!
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
All hollow.  Oh --
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh --
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
My mouth -- my mouth!
Oil can....
Oil can.....Oil can....
You don't get around us that easy!
Don't push!
Where do we go now?
You don't neither --
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Whozat?
It's a whatzis?
Hold still - hold still --
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Not even a rhinoceros?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
Ohhhhhh!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Go on!
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
You put up a great fight, Lion.
No, you don't.
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out.
Oh --
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
We'll get you together!
Now, now, don't fret.
Well, that's you all over.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
It's a whozis.
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Oh - look out.
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Ho -- ho --ho
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Let's.
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Dorothy!
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Hurry -- hurry --
A heart --
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
To Oz!
We do.
No, sir!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
Help!
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
Stop that dog!
But I still want one.
