Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
No -- No -- No -- No!
Oh, come on now - everybody --
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Yes -- there --
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
...along.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
The other side....
He said his mouth.
Oil can what?
What?
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
To Oz!
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Yes -- that's true.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Where's Kansas?
They would?
Did I scare you?
...free!
My, it's good to be....
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Ohhhh --
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
It's pleasant down that way, too.
You humbug!
This way!  Come on!
Stop pushing!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Up!
That's right.
Yes, you.
And you're going to lead us.
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Here --   Come on.
Oh, you did it yourself!
What happened?
What's the matter?
Who at?
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Don't you start it, too!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Yeah --
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Oh, no!
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Come on, fellows!
...to Dorothy!
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
Oh, dear, dear.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
It's a whozis?
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
You know something?
Oh, did - did you see that?
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Yes.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Hey, Dorothy!
Emerald City!
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Come on -- come on --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Animals that -- that eat straw?
To Oz?
That's right.
No, sir!
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
Beautiful!  What an echo!
How can I ever thank you enough?
Th.D.?
You promised us real things -- a real...
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
What about us?
It makes you nervous?
