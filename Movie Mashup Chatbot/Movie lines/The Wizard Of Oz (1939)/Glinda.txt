And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Are you ready now?
Whenever you wish.
Toto, too.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Oh!  Well....
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
It's too late!  There they....
...ting the ruby slippers?
Leave her alone!
