No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
No --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
No --
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Oh -- all right.
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Aunt Em!
You are?
Who are you?
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Our echo.
Oh --
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Ohhh!
Oh ....
I don't believe you!
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Hickory!
Oh!
This?
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Run, Toto, run!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Oh, now?
...Toto, too?
I have?
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
I thought you said she was dead.
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Toto's my dog.
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
But you couldn't have been, could you?
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oh, you....
Oh, no -- no!
...paper?
Has it poppies on the wall....
What's she doing now?
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Me?
Oh --
That's right.  What's she doing?
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
That's our farm!
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
No, they won't - honestly.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Why --
How did you guess?
Stop her!
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
No --
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
...yes.
Yes...!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
I knew you would!
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh --
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
What sort of an animal is that?
Oh --
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Oh-oh-
Oh --
Oh! Oh!
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh --
Oh --!
Well, you're perfect now.
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
...Oh, did that hurt?
Oh...
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Did you say something?
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
Ohhh!
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Oh --
Does it work?
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Oh, come on.
But why?  Why?
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Supposin' you met an elephant?
How about a hippopotamus?
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
I'll be home in time for supper!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Yes -- let's run!
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
A home --
Oh.
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
No, but you tried to.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
I have so got brains.
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Oh -- Oh --
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Oh --
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Oh --
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Yes --- there.
Here -- here --
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oh --
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
To Oz?
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
I don't blame you for that.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Um-hmm.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Um-hmm.
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Ohhh --
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Ohh!
...yes.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
...don't talk.
