Oh --
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
...bed.
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
...room --
Uh-huh.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Her -- her name is Emily.
...her face is careworn.
Oh -- yes.
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Oh --
Aw, come, come, come --
Oh --
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Yes --
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
