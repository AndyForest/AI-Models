Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
They're coming back!
Did they hurtcha?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Huh?  What'd he say?
Ohh!
Because I'm still scared!
I'd sooner wait outside.
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Not nobody, not nohow!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Who's her?  Who's her?
Hah!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Yes.
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
The nerve.
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
...has been simply unbearable.
You're right -- I am a coward.
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
It did?
Dorothy next!
Yeah.
Real courage. That's what we want.
Yeah!
Where -- where do we go now?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Now...
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Yeah. Me?
Fine.  He's got a plan
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
What was that?
I -- Oh --
Somebody pulled my tail.
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
I don't know.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Not nohow!
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Yeah.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
Yeah --
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Whozat?
It's a whatzis.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away!
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Imposserous!
Dorothy!
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
I haven't slept in weeks.
Oh, scared, huh?
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why!
