Thank you, ma'am.
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Thank you, ma'am...
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Thank you, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am?
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
So do I!
That's it! We made it!
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
No way.
The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
Yeah?
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
I'm not finished yet.
Right!
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
What for?
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
I wanna report a robbery!
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
Sorry to have bothered you.
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
Sorry, ma'am.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Yes, ma'am.
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yes, ma'am...
Thank you, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am.
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Yes, ma'am...
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Ahhh, Billy...
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...
In ya go...
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Marry who?
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
What is it, kid?
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Yeah, kid?
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
Go ahead! Go back!
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
A bus?
Fuck Miss Ratched!
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
So long suckers.
Shhh...
So long, kid.
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
That's okay, kid...
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
What's your name, buddy?
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
Whatcha boys playin'?
Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an' me. Do ya understand?
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Say... God Bless America!
Say it again.
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Hey, what's that?
They must be up there!
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Shhh...
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
Let me get on your shoulders.
Come here!
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Atta boy, Cheswick!
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
What for?
Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
Shhh...
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Huh?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Scanlon out!
You can come back later!
I'm the coach!
I said out!
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I'm busting outta this place.
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Just warmin' up.
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
Okay, Harding, you're on.
You heard me the first time!
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
Lobotomy?
What for?
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Your buddy is callin' ya.
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
Bye-bye.
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Right!
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
That's twenty up, Martini.  Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
That's a dime, Martini.
'Kay, place your bets.
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
Yeah, buddy?
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
Time out!
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
When?
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
You bet, Doc!
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Doc, what can I tell ya?
That's correct, Doc ...
I don't, Doc...
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Poker!
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
All I'm askin' is...
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
Shhh!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
Shhh!  This way!
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
How much ya wanna bet?
Oh, yeah?
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
You're on!
All right!
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
You think it's funny, huh?
You're breathin' right now.
How do ya know that?
You look pretty healthy to me.
What's troubling ya, buddy?
No, 'fraid not...
Yeah, buddy?
Martini out!
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Okay. Who else?
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
That right?
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Sure...
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
You's better believe it, brother!
Come an' see.
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
'Kay...
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
You know, I never got your name.
You an' me, Chief.
What are they?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Just great!  See ya around!
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
He's in charge.
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Yeah...
He's a patient, Rose...
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
I don't have any.
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Yeah!
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Hi.
Thank you, ma'am,
After you, ma'am.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Yes, ma'am...
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
What kind of crap is that???
You're a witness, Doc!
Bet!
How 'bout twenty?
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Asshole.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
