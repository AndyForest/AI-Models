And you haven't heard the last of this!
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
What are these men doing up wandering around?
At this hour?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Is everything all right?
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
