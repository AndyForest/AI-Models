Ya know what, Fred?
Lemme see...
My feet hurt...
Me too...
I'll bet a dollar.

Yesterday...
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Just wait till you hear...
What's he talkin' about?
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
There they are!
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
On what?
Big man!
Boogered!
Hit me!
Potential assaultive.
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Hi.
