Time out!
Time out!
We'll let you know.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
I'm afraid not.
Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
How are you feeling?
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
Good. Good.
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
I see...
In what way?
I see.
Oh, what was that?
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Is that so?
Oh, do you do much fishing?
Oh, what's that?
Hold it!
