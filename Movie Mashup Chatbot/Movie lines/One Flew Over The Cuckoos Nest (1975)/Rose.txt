Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Wait a minute...
Wow! They're so quiet.

Are they all crazies?
What?
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Are you a doctor?
Who is he?
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Oh, yeah...
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Oh, yeah...
You ol' fucker!
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
He's dead.
I thought so.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
