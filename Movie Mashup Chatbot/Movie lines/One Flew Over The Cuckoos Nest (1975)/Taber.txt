Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
Somebody's coming!
I don't believe it...
Ten bucks.
Yeah!
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
What's going on?
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Because I quit breathing.
I'm the next one.
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Are you a doctor?
