Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Oh yeah...
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Yes, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.

Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Is he in an asylum?
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
What?
What happened?
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
