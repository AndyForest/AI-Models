Where will we go?
I have nothing to go back for.
Alice?
...never doubt what you are doing.
Yes. I want you to go.
Our father? Did you see my father?
Are we safe?
What is it?
No. I will find you.
What would you have me do?
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Mr Poe?
Much further?
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
How did you learn English?
I'm sorry.
Thank you so much.
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
Why did they turn back?
What?!
He did?
Your "father"?
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
You knew them.
Why didn't you bury those people?
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
There was no letter.
There was none!
When? How?
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
Yes. Go ahead.
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
I am sorry, Duncan...
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
He delivered no such message.
My God, Alice.
Yes. Yes, I will.
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Some say that's the way of it.
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
You still have an aversion to the water?
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
