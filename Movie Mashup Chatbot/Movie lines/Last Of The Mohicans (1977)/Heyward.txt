The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Absolutely.
Are you alright?
Yes, miss.
My God, you've grown up.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
I see...
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
One called Magua arrived.
It can be dangerous...
Will you consider that?
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
"Some"?
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
And by sea!
Any powder?
And if we're unlucky?
Then what?
I don't understand!
Where do we go from here?
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
How long?
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
That is sedition! Treason!
Excuse me...
Who were these people?
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
Fort Edward, then?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
What?!
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
How far is it, scout?
We were headed...
By your leave, sir.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
Sir!
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Yes, sir.
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Fire!
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Sergeant Major!
Fire!!!
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Fire!!!
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
What is enough?
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
Yes.
Gold could be arranged.
Yes.
Yes.
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Excuse me. What did you say?
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
