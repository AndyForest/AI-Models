You're not coming with us?
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.

We'll see in the morning...
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
