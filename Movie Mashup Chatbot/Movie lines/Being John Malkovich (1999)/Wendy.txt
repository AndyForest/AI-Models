Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what itï¿½s for.
Ha ha ha!
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Hello, Don.
