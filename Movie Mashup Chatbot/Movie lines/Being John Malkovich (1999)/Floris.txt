You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
Yex?
Mr. Juarez?
Money, Miss Warts?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Pardon?
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
