... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Yeah, okay.
I don't know.
I never played a jewel thief.
Thank you.
Malkovich.
Yeah.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
That... was... no... simulation.
Let me try!
Let me try.
Simulates?
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit, yes!
Maxine...
Do you?
Says who?
Do you?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Who needs dancing?
Is there dancing?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Never heard of it.
What's the play?
How do we do that?
She's not available.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
Did you see the reviews?
Good-bye, Maxine.
Derek Mantini!
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Sleepy suddenly.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
He's a selfish bastard.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
You mean with Malkovich?
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
I'm getting better all the time.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Come on in.
What the fuck is going on?
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Yes, Maxine, yes.
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Can I get you a drink?
How'd you get this number?
Who's calling?
Yeah?
