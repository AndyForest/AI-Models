Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
I know.
People make mistakes.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
A better friend.
The monkey.
It's Elijah.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
My God!
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I need a shower.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
You fell in love with her first.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
What's that?
It'll never happen, fuckface.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
You bastard.
Suck my dick!
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Me and John.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Yes.
Fuck Maxine.
Us, of course.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
What are you doing?
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Weï¿½ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
I have to go back now.
I have to go back.
I'm scared.
Now?
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I want to try.
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
'kay.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
The iguana.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
I was worried.
Did you eat?
Hi.
She's very beautiful.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Seven-ish
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Why, Craig. why?
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Is the trial date set?
The monkey.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Hush, sweetheart.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Why not? I need to get in there!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
You bastard!
No.
No, I didn't know that.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
I'm getting divorced.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
We have to meet.
I have to see you.
Maxine...
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
Yes, Hi.
