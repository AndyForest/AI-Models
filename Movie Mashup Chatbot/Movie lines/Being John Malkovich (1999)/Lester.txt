I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain �doors� which should never be opened.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. �Ladies,� I begin. �I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you�re implying.
Security.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
The Great Mantini?
What kind of circumstances?
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
I like that.
A scary dream?
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Good morning, Lotte!
Thank you, Floris.
Yes, my dear?
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Forget it.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
But of course.
Anybody else?
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
No you mustn't, my child.
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
Oh, be still my heart.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
