J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Let him try.
Lotte? Is that you?
Lotte, this is so good...
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
I've fallen in love.
You're late.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Sure. It'd be fun.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
What's he been in?
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
It better be.
No.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Yikes.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
You're a fag or a liar.
Don�t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
My tits?
The usual, Barry.
You married?
Just.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Somebody told you.
Who told you?
Who told you?
Why not?
Yeah.
What?
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Yes, well...
I wouldn't know.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Two hundred dollars, please.
You can be John Malkovich.
No. Don't be an ass.
No.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
One hour.
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
I love you, Lotte.
When?
Yes?
Ah.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Let her go, Craig. I mean �him."
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Whatever.
Yeah what?!
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
You've got to be kidding.
Bad dream, darling?
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Vegas.
It's okay, my sweet.
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Stay in him forever?
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
I'd love to see your work.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
You still there, sweets?
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
Lotte called me.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Darling!
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Oh, Lotte...
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Do you mind?
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Thanks so much for coming over.
Whatever you're having.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Mr. Malkovich?
