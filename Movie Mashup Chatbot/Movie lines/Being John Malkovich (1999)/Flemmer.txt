Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Fine. Let's drop it.

Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.

Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
