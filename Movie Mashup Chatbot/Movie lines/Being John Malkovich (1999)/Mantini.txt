No.
Great then.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Yeah, I saw them
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
