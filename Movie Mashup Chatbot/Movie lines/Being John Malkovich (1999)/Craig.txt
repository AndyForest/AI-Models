Tell your friends.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Please, have a seat.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
You came up here looking for the portal?
I'm sorry for everything.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
The iguana?
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
I love you so much.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
I'm a puppeteer.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
Tell her you need to see her.
Shut up!
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Don't forget me.
We?
And he was with her.
You were him last night, weren't you?
We wish.
What about Maxine?
What's that?
You've always loved the animals.
No they're not.
What?
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
So how was it? What was he doing?
Why?
How was it?
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
Why aren't you at work?
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
What?
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
Yeah. You want a beer?
Right.
The ferret?
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We�re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
Hi.
Just an idea I had.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
We have to make it an early night.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
I... puppeteer.
I'm a puppeteer.
May 11th.
Yeah. Okay.
Which one is Elijah again?
What?
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Enjoy.
Morning.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
I know. I'm sorry...
So how was it?
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
Sure, after a fashion.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit, yes!
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I�m in love with somebody else.
I am a trained performer.
I said "yes."
Yes?
Forget it.
My name is Schwartz.
Schwartz.
Schwartz.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
You're insane.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Dr. Lester...
Thank you, sir.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Dr. Lester. . .
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Yessir.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
No. I understand perfectly.
No.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
You're glowing again.
You're evil, Maxine.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
My God.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
You wanted to be partners with me?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
This is important!
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Please, let me explain.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Hi.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
I�m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
That's the usual?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
What'll you have?
Yeah. But enough about me.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Maxine.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
I'm right?
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
I just wanted to say �hi.�  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
No, really.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Emily Dickinson.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Is that true?
Moving story.
