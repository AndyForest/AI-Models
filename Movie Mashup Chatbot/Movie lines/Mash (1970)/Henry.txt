Stop him! Stop that man!
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Yes, O'Reilly?
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
But what about Major Houlihan?
A football game?
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
Your tent?
You don't aim to cause any trouble ï¿½ But?
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
What's wrong with you?
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Yes, that's what I mean.
What's going on? Who started this?
Damn.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Morning, Captain.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Oh, get out of here!
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Yes, dammit, and...
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
O'Reilly!
I out-coached that General Hammond.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
They can't do that to me!
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
