Wait a second...
Frank...
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
Ravenous. What about you?
We think the same way.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
I have a tent to myself.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
All of them?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Good morning.
