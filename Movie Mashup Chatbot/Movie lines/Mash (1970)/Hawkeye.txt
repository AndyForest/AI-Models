Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
He's parted his moorings.
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
Same here. You can retire my number.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
An application to Androscoggin College.
When will he be able to write?
Never mind. Forget it.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
The chest-cutter.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
He can't take much more time on the table.
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore ï¿½  House. You in the market Duke?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
I was just asking...
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I think I heard about that.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
And there it is.
So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
You betcher ass, General.
You betcher ass, Dad.
Gimme three.
Radar!
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
What for?
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
He can move in here with us.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
They're coming.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
What do we do?
I don't get it.
I don't feel anything.
If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
It's in pretty deep.
For you, Trapper.
Radar!
Is he out?
What's the age of consent in this country?
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
An eternal damnation.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
That's right. We work well together.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
Hang in there.
See you.
What's the matter?
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
The bastards outconned us.
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
I didn't mean with me.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
You're leaving tomorrow?
Maria...
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Of course not.
Ayuh.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Same here.
Something else we have in common.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
It isn't always this rough?
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
Why would he do that?
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Yeah!
I didn't have much choice.
Duke...
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Glad to help.
They missed the boat.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
What's wrong with him?
What's the story?
Why can't you look at him?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
You don't go after the local scrunch?
The one and only.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
In the direction you want to go.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Just in dreams?
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
There's only one worth noticing.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I don't think so either.
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
That. It's out of the act.
You can cut the bow.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
First decent idea you've had in a month.
Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
About that chest-cutter...
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
The blonde dish.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
