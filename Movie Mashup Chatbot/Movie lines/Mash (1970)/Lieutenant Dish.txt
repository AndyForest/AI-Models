I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
You think he won't.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
You're asking for somebody else?
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
You're on his side all of the sudden?
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
Even if I weren't.
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
Very happily married.
But I'm married.
You're an attractive man.
Our minds?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
How did you get called that?
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
