Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
How much time do I have?
You guys got any black capsules?
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
No, never in the slightest.
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
Homosexuality.
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
