That's my morning's pay.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
It will.
It is not.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
Will be.
Hundred and eight already.
