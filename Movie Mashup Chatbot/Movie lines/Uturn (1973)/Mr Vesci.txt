Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
And John, don't make me come look for you.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
The old lady?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
