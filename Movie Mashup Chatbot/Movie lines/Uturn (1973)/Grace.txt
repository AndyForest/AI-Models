Sheriff Potter.
John--
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
What do you want?
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
John . . .
I . . .
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Jake.  No.  No!
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
When did you buy a gun?
Jake, what is that?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
What's the matter?
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
You haven't even looked at them once.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Wrong number.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
Someone will find me.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
No.  I swear it.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
It's . . . it's locked.
The trunk.  It's locked.
John, throw me the keys.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
I'll get it.
I'm here.
Can you climb back up.
Are you all right?
John!
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
But I want to say with you,
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
But you said we could be together.
Now what?
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
He was going to--
Just drive.
It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
He was going to take the money.
I shot him.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
What?
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
John . . .?
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Where are you going?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Let him watch.  I want him to know what he's missing.
Let's do it here.
No.
If you want.
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
There has to be!
Don't yell at me!
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
I don't know.
What was I supposed to do?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Because I know you're full of shit.
Stop it.
There is no us, remember?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
What are you talking about?
John, please--
John?  John where are you going?
We'd have to kill him.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Lied?  What do you mean?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
Jake.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
Take me with you.
Is it pretty?
Have you ever been there before?
How far is it to California?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
I don't know how.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
No.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You never did answer my question.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Games?
Such as?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Beautiful?
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Lift me down.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Come here.
Those are white words, not ours.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
I guess it must.
Thank you.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
What happens if you lose?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Where you headed?
You've been around.
Where you coming from?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Least you can leave.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You're not from around here, are you?
Thank you, John.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You should be more careful.
What happened to your hand?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You sure you can manage?
It's Grace.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Maybe I don't want you to.
Do you have to call me that?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I'm just going to my car.
