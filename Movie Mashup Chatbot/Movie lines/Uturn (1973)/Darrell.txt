I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
You got the money?
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
Come back when the sun comes up.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
What you want?
There you go, sweet talking me again.
Yeah, you better remember that.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Two-hundred.
No charge.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Hundred-fifty.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Don't look like nothing.
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Just a car.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Twenty-after-ten.
Time.
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
So?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Yep.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
He's up at the Look Out.
Nope.  Darrell.
You want somethin'?
