You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
I said come on!
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
I asked you a question.
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
Now, what's this?
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Mister!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Stand up.
Not before I settle with you.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
You expect me to believe that?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
