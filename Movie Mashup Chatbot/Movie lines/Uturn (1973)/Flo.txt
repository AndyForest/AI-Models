Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
We ain't got no Beck's.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
It'd serve you right.  Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
Let me get your change.
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
