Any parting words of wisdom?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
You don't fear death?
You afraid of the dark?
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
I think I've heard that before.
Maybe I do.
That a fact?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
He no!
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Oh, Jesus.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
Christ!
Yeah, yeah.
All right, old man.  Christ.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
I said I was sorry.
Christ no!
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
You can't do that yourself?
You want something?
You want something, old man?
I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
It's a Movado.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
Nothing.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Yeah.  Just a little short. Figures.  I just wanted to get out, that's all.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
One way.
How much.
I don't care, just get me there.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Out of here.
I need a ticket.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
What's it to you?
I want my car.
It is morning.
Open up!
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
Please, just leave the car alone.
No!
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
You believe that?
You've been there?
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You son of a bitch!
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
How much!?
How much?
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Nothing.
Hey.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Accident.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
What time is it now?
How much time?
Hey!
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
But he's dead.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
You own this place?
Will he be back soon?
Harlin around?
You Harlin?
Yeah, I'll try.
Yeah, give me the Miller.
Genuine Draft?
Kirin?
Let me have a Beck's.
You got beer?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
What for?
Where the hell am I going to go?
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
I think I busted my leg.
Grace!
I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
Well, nothing.
You could give me the gun.
You killed a man for no reason!
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
You killed him!
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
You heard me.  Count it out.
Give him the money.
Not me.  Us.
No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Funny thing.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
To get my car.
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
You got a suitcase?
What about him?
Let's go in the bedroom.
We're going all the way.  Together.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Where's the safe?
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Grace . . . Grace?
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
What about us?
I wanted to talk.
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
Shit!
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
How much money has he got?
You live pretty good.
From?
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
Where?
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
I can't.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Yeah.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Whatever it takes.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
You just walk away.
You could just leave him.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I'm guessing no.
Did you ever?
You love him?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
You know what I want.
Still playing?
I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my fortune.  Thanks for the lemonade.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
All right, Grace.  No more games.
I have ideas.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Like they're made of polyester.
Like you.
What?
The same thing you do.
My face tell you all that?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
A medicine man?
Where'd you learn to do that?
What do you do anyway?
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
Nice place you got here.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
I didn't say it bothered me.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I just drove in this morning.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
You're welcome, Grace.
I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
Yes, I have.
That a fact?
It's nothing.  Really.
That's all right.  I got it.
Wasn't nothing.
No trouble at all, really.
Accident.
No, I've got it.
I got it.
Jesus.
May I carry your package, Grace?
My cup runneth over, beauti--
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
I don't know your real name.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
That's right on my way.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
You're not talking sense.
Christ, Jake, please--
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Come on, Jake--
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
It's the truth, Jake.
I came to kill her.
I came for Grace.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Jake--
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
It's not like that.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Yeah, well, me too.
No.
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
You think that's a lot of money?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
SHUT UP!
Drop it, Jake.
Shut up.
You love her, but you hate her?
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
You know what I mean.
The time wasn't right.
No.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
And tell her what?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
What should I do?
I guess I might as well get this done with.
Do we shake hands?
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
I need thirteen.
How much could you get?
Make it twenty.
How do you put a price on murder?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
You meant it.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
I'm not rambling.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
About what you said this morning.
About things.  About your wife.
I was hoping we could talk.
Isn't that illegal?
Nice office you've got.
I had a problem getting my car back.
No.
No.
Just ran into a little trouble.
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Why would I kill her?
Would I what?
Like you don't know.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Hey!
Wait a second--
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
John Stewart.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Accident.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
Grace, tell him.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Husband . . .?
Who the hell are you?
Get away from me!
Will you shut up!
What the hell are you talking about?
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
How old are you?
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
For what?
You're too quick for me.
Oz.
I've had time to get over it.
She's dead.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
What?
Nooo!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Give it to me!
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
Oh, shit!
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Christ, I don't believe this.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
They're not very imaginative?
You're fucked.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?
I wasn't doing anything.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
A hundred-forty-five really.
I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
And you're taking?
Thirty-thousand dollars.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
I didn't do anything.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
What for?
Sure, Sheriff.
I don't understand what the--
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Not as bad as it looks.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
I guess.
Jesus!
What happened?
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
No police!
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
No police.
No!
Soda.  You know.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Got any cold soda?
