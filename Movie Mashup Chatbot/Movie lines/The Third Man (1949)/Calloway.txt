Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
That's what we want to find out.
I said another man was buried in his place.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
You can help us.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
He works in a military hospital.
Joseph Harbin...
Do you know this man?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
That's the reason.
...parents.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Yes, of course.
No, not yet.
What is it?
Be sensible, Martins.
Well, there's not much time.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
What time is it?
Win what?
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
Didn't I?
A girl of spirit.
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
How about the doorway?
Which side of the road?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
No.
I see.
Well?...
...in the morning.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
...a week ago.
I can't. He disappeared...
So would I.
Next, Paine.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Do you see what that means?
In Vienna...
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Get the next plane.
Miss Schmidt.
Calloway.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Getting around, Martins.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
It wasn't petrol.
Ever seen one?
He was...
...to him.
Best thing that ever happened...
What?
No.
I can't say that I have.
No, sorry.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
See much of him before that?
When did you see him last?
Schmolka!
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Been here long?
You a friend of Lime's?
My name is Calloway.
Fellow called Lime.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
...of Santa Fe."
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
It's a military hotel.
Take him to Sacher's.
