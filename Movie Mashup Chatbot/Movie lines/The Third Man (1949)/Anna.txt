They think you did it.
Give her some cigarettes.
Ja, ja, ja.
Ich weiss nicht.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
Why are you lying?
His.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
How do you know?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
I shall be all right.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
I'm sorry.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
How did you know I would be here?
Are you going, too?
There isn't enough for two laughs.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
I'll put these flowers in water.
He liked to laugh.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
He told you, didn't he?
Have you?
Have you seen Calloway?
What happened to your hand?
Why?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
Wer ist da?
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
What are you going to do?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Let's go away.
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
We're both in it, Harry.
I thought you wanted...
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
It's just what he used to say.
...and buried him.
Tell me more.
Where is she?
When...what did you do?
Tell me about him.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
What's that?
Well you read this.
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
In German?
Just another part I've got to learn.
Need we go through it all again?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Whiskey.
Dr. Winkel.
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
They're forged.
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
Mmmm.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Yes.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Oh, yes, yes.
No.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
Do you understand German?
Sit down.
Nichts danke. Kein.
Thank you.
Of course.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
I don't know.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Where's Harry?
What did you say? I'm sorry...
It's true then?
Two weeks ago.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
It wasn't important.
No.
No.
I have never seen him.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
And my passport?
There's nothing in them.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
They're Harry's.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
Yes.
Good-bye.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
I don't...
I don't want it.
They are - private - letters.
Must you take those?
