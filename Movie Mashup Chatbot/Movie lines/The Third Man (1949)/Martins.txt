...anyway?
...quarrel?
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
Oh, well.
That's his headache.
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
Oh, the usual things...
I saw him today.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
Here, it will be cold on that train.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Harry.
...Headquarters.
...is there?
Oh...
...again.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
...you know.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
A parrot...Let it go.
I'm going back home.
I don't know.
Me.
I wish I knew.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
Wait here.
What's the matter?
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
It's all right.
Holly.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
Seemed like a good idea.
Anna.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
Oh, that was many years ago.
...to steal my girl.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Tell you what?
H-E-Z-T...
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
Gestern bein heurigen...
Do I...
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Can I hear you?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Silly looking bunch.
Who are you looking for now?
Harry?
Drink?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Why?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
What's she talking about?
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
I was told there were only two men there.
...at all.
He was Harry's driver?
Were you at the inquest?
His own doctor?
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
He has a little dog.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
You were awfully good.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Thank you.
How will I know you?
Where?
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Yes.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
One can't just leave - please.
Wait a minute - let me out.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Two thirty.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
I said you win.
All right, Calloway. You win.
Of course.
You all did.
She's right. It's none of my business.
Calloway!
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
It wouldn't work.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
Fifty yards right down there.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
I suppose you don't believe me.
This is where he vanished.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Thank you. Excuse me.
I'm not asking you to.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
Bring him in.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Well?
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
A parrot bit me.
A bruised lip.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
You're not locking her up?
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
What the devil?
...expense.
Listen, Callaghan.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Pin it on a...
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
What are you trying to say?
Him dying like that.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
Holly Martins.
Once in a while.
September '39.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
No.
Yes.
Martins.
Can you tell me whose...
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
...his number.
No, I don't know...
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Zane Grey.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
What's that?
What about?
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Heard of Harry Lime?
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
Come upstairs a moment.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
They wouldn't know me.
Welcome?
You do!
...this way.
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
You told them, didn't you?
As long as they can use you?
You've got plenty of contacts.
Why not?
You can get somebody else...
You wouldn't do anything.
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
And - Anna...
I told the police.
You can help her.
She's been arrested.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
I want to talk to you.
Listen...
Hello, Harry.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
How do you do.
The Roumanian?
Not yet.
What's the name of this girl?
...your address?
Will you give me...
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
...you.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
But he said he died instantaneously.
What did he say?
Here?
You really liked it?
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
Coffee.
In great pain?
Could he have been at all conscious?
Hear the details.
Thank you.
Martins.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Dr. Winkel?
Yes, it is.
Well make it your business.
Now, hold on.
Suppose I take...
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
You don't mean that doctor?
And?
The Roumanian?
Kurtz.
Who else?
I was told that he did not die at once.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Could he have been conscious?
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
You saw it?
What's he saying?
What does he say?
You remember me? Upstairs...
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Excuse me!
Must be some mistake.
Coffin?
Who?
Speak English?
Never.
Should I make it all fact?
Yes.
Not when I get interested.
Third Man.
Joseph Harbin.
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
He didn't want to get involved.
That's all you meant?
Something wrong.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Harry...
Oh, you did.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Oh.
