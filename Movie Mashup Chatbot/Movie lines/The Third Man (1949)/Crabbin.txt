Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Of course, of course, of course.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Seems exciting.
Certainly.
Goodness, that's awkward.
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
No, a major, were you really?
I know a very good dentist.
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Never heard of him.
Who?
What is it, Sergeant?
