What do you want?
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
Sure...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
What do you want me to do?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
Did the police believe you?
Unwise, Holly...
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Holly...
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
Hmm.
It's good to see you, Holly.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
Yes.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
