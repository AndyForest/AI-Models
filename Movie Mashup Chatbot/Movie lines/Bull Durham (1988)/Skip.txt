We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.

I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
Check it out.
What the hell's going on out there?
Okay...

Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
