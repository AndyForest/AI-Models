Yes.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
There are limits.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Let's stay for a while.
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
They wouldn't know.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Yes... I'll give you that.
I don't understand any of that.
What was that all about?
Your color.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Be careful.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
How are you doing?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I know that...
No?
Well... OK...
Why?
OK.
Ben?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
What?
Don't you like me, Ben?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Very clever.
Yes.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Thank you. What time is it?
You OK?
You OK out there?
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Are you serious.
What's up?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
To death?
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
OK... whatever.
Do you want to fuck now?
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
You were going to get my door.
I sometimes fade out.
I guess I do too.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
No -- S.E.R.A.
You're pretty drunk.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Hello.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Where are you staying?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Yuri... are you...
No.
It's me, Yuri.
Don't hit me.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Where have you been staying?
I am lonely, Yuri.
I've been all right.
Please, Yuri.
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
