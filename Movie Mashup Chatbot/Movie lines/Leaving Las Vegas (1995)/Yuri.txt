Sera... please go.
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Yes? What?
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
A full night on the street and this is all?
Where have you been?
All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
With an old friend.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
You have been lonely?
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
You have been lonely?
I want this, Sera. I need this!
