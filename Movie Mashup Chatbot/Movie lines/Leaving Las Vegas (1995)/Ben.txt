Water.
Water?
No.
No.
No.
...Noooo.
What do you think I should get?
No alcohol?
What are my choices?
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
You know I love you... yeah?
I wanted to see you...
Yes... I guess I knew that.
Will you lighten up, please?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
OK.
I like it here with you.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Yeah... I'd like that.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
No... we already talked about that.
Thank you, Sera.
Please!
Can we just ignore it?
Can we just forget it?
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
We?
That's impressive. How did you do that?
Oh, and what did you do?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
What do you mean?
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
When?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I'm going to fill it right now.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Sorry.
Of course.
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Right... OK...
Hi!
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Don't be silly?
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Sera you are crazy.
Me neither.
Sera...
What do you mean?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
How long have I been here?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Do they have drinks?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
This is the home of an angel.
You do?
Yes.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
Don't run away.
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
If I was I'm sorry.
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
Yes, that's right.
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Of course.
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Of course.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
You what?
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
Sarah -- with an H?
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
Are you working?
Hello!
I don't know. I'll find out though.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
How'd this happen?
What did they look like?
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
