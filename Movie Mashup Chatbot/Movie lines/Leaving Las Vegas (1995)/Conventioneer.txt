Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
About ready for another drink?
