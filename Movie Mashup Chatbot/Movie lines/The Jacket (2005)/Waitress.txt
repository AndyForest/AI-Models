Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
I'm sorry.
So you never knew your mother?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
You remember it?
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
[Beat] Real is overrated.
Well, good for you.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
[Beat] I do it.
Yup. That's me.
This is pretty good. Considering...
You want a drink?
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
What's this?
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Well, how'd you get here?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Of course you don't know.
Well, where are you from?
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Good.
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
