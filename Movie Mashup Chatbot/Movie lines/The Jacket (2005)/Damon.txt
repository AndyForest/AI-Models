I never touched your father! I swear!
I don't know what you're talking about, man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
Do I know you from somewhere?
