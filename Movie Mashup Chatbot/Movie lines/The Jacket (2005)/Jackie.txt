Why?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
How you doin'?
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
Ok.
Ok, I guess.
I've been ok.
Then, where are you going?
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
What?
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
To the hospital.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
William, you're not making sense.
It's Sunday.
[Beat] I don't know.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
What? What are you thinking?
[Beat, lost] No.
They're not here.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
How long do we have?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
You think Lorenson kills you?
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
I know.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
[Beat] You bled to death.
But no one knew until after...
It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Please...
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
I looked it up.
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
Well, you belong in one.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
What for?
What're those?
You're just gonna walk?
Yeah.
But I like it I guess.
Jackie.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Our car won't start.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
I don't understand.
How?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
