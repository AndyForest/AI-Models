I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Poppycock!
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Victor Frankenstein.
No!
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
You have the wrong house.
... No!
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Carlson!
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Give him an extra dollar.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Good night.
I suppose you're right.
That's a tough choice.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
I suppose you're right.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
All right then!
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Ready, darling?
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Surprised!
Darling!
Goodbye, darling!
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
You bet your boots it does.
You're incorrigible!
Whatever makes you happy.
Oh, nice.
Very....very!
Oh, darling -- so will I.
I promise.
Yes.
Yes, don't worry.
Yes.
Of course.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Good.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Well... we'll see.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
There seem to be quite a few books.
May I have it, please?
Yes!... the laboratory.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
It seems fine.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
One week at the most!?
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
I didn't do that.
What?
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
How long will this whole thing take?
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Fron kon steen!
My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
How old are you, young man?
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
My father was a sick man.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
A piece of what?
Yes?
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
It's the only way.
Is everything ready?
There's only one way.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
What???
What monster?
I'm a failure.
Thanks...for all your help.
Maybe...if you get here on time.
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
All right -- where is she?
Where is he?
What did you find out?
Act casual!
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
... I'm glad that's...
I'm not trying to be funny.
Why?
Yes.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
But you did -- I just heard it.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
Throw the third switch!
More, do you hear me?
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
Throw the second switch!
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
All right... elevate me!
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
If you like -- just hurry!
Why?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
I want that brain.
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
How?
What a filthy job!
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
What is this place?
Did you see anyone else down here?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
Did you hear that strange music?
Did you hear that strange music??
Did you hear that strange music?
But what you were doing?
What are you doing here?
Aye-gor!
I wonder what's got into them?
Home.
Wockers with the knockers???
What wockers?
No.
Why are you talking like that?
I beg your pardon?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
Yes, just the two.
How do you do?
I'm sure we will.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
But they told me it was Ee gor.
You must be Igor.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
No, Fred ereck.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
Fron kon steen!
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Get the sedative ready!
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
How's everything?
Hello there.
It's alive!
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Oh, just a little.
May I see your violin?
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
What's that tune that you're playing
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMmmmmm!
MMmmm.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Yes, I have mine.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
Just passing through the night.
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
Good night!
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Did you do it?
Give him the sedative!
All right -- give it to him!
Stop -- singing!!!
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Do you think you can sing it?
I think I'll...carry him.
It looks that way.
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
Reputation.  Reputation!
Raise the platform, hurry!
I know.
A god?
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Well, this explains the music.
What a filthy mess.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Inga, wake up!
Inga!
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
Would you like a sandwich?
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
Well...
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
How nice.
