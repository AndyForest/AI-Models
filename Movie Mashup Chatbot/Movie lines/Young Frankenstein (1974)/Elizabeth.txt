So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Love me oodles and oodles?
Still happy you married me?
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Is it that music?
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
What?
What in God's name are you doing?
I...
Well... yes.
Hello...?
That's my good boy.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Is it worth taking a chance?
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Why does he call you 'master'?
What a strange fellow.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Darling!?!
Love me?
Surprised?
Darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling.
Does that mean you love me?
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
I hope you like large weddings.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Will you miss me?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Promise??
Call me from New York before you leave??
And your passport?
You have your tickets?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
