Miss me?
Surprised?
Darling!
Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Come on, big fellow!
I'll bet it's a doozy.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
That sound good, boss.
He's carrying her off now through the woods.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
That's what we're paid for.
Can you play it?
How do you know it was a 'she'?
How do you know it was a 'he'?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
How's it going?
Yes, Master!
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
No, no!  That whole thing!
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
You can say that again.
Original.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
Don't fall for that one.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
It wasn't me.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
Who are you talking to?
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
You'll be getting me sad next.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
You can't win 'em all.
Wait till he sees the bill.
What?
What?
This guy means business.
You've got it, master.
Tonight?
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Thank you, Master.
It's always been one of my favorite names.
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
That's not bad.
Hmm!
Was he any good?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
I have a pretty good idea.
Could be raining!
Could be worse!
Taking the book along?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Must be the music room.
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
What?
What?
What?
Just putting up some tea.
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
Fro-derick!
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Home!
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
The wockers with the knockers.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
I thought you wanted to.
There wolf!  There castle!
There.
What hump?
Are these your bags?
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
I see.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Are you putting me on?
Frederick Frankenstein?
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Three minutes to go!
How long is it so far?
How do you know they're done?
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
His what??
No, not sound.
