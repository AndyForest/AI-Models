Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Are you ready for me?
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Yes, I will.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
Why don't we talk inside?
And I have mine.
But, after all, you have yours.
And Elizabeth has hers.
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
Nor to Elizabeth.
What?
Of course not.
I know Frederick.
I see what you mean.
Not fooling around.
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Good night, Doctor.
I think so.
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Are you serious??
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
I'd be so nervous.
Me?  Sing?
What are you going to do?
What do you think we should do?
I think you've done it, master.
Oh, Doctor!
It wasn't me.
I thought it was wonderful.
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Right here?
Yes!
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
And look at this, Doctor!
Oh, doctor!
But who was playing it?
Look, Doctor!
Ooh!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
Are you busy?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Extremely well.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
nan
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Yes.
Four
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Look how far we've come.
I'm getting tired.
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
His schwanzstucker.
There must have been someone else down here then.
