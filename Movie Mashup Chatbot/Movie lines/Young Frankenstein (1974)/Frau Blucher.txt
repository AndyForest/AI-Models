This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Will there be anything else?
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
This is the only library I know of.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
You mean... the laboratory??
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
