Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Yes, my dear, he is.
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
