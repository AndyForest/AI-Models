It was different then.
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
No!
Kalen...
Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Go back to your own time?
So you can use it now?
It's undamaged?
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Is it?
Someone you loved very much.
You lost someone.
You know this?
Alexander...?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
It must have been safe.
Did you have fires at night?
Learning was important?
You liked it there.
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
I don't understand.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
The mud carriers.
Yes.
Thank you.
We share everything.
Every night.
We all have that dream.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Good night, then.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Why would you do that?
Why?
How long ago?
That machine --
Oh, that explains everything.
Then you can speak slowly.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
You're not from beyond the valley.
He's gone to a better place.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Mm.
Is there a lot of illness?
Yes.
How long did you travel?
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
No, you're safe --
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
We'll see about that.
What's it like where you come from?
That's quite enough, Kalen.
Kalen...
