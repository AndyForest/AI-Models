Let them.
Alex... people are staring.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
Heavens, look at that now!
So it's astronomy now, is it?
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
We took a walk three days ago.
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Alex, it's just the zoo.
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
Alex...?!
Alex, what is it?
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
All right...
Darling.
Alex, what is it?
Trust me...
Dance with me...
You're late.
A moonstone.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
You're getting warmer.
Admiration?  My my.
All right, what is it now?
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
Talk away, Professor.
Well there's something new.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
You promised me flowers.
Trust me...
Dance with me...
You're late.
