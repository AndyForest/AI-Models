May I get you some --
Yes, sir, he --
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
Sir?
No, sir.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
For our sake, I hope not.
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
