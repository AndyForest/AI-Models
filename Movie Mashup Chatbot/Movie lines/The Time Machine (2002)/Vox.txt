I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
End...?
How are your dreams now?
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
The air... the power.
This way.
Yes.
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
It's what they want you to see.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
So, do we go on?
It was meant to.
It frightens you.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
Send him away.
When was his mother taken?
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Excuse me?
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Morlocks --
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
