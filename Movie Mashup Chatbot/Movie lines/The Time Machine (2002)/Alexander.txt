Yes.  Just about here.
Around here.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
What happened?
What kind of stories?
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
Where?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Ah... no.
On the towers?
I had an accident.
The journey is part of my work.
I will...
I'll never forget this.
I don't understand.
I won't leave you like this.
Vox...
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
Vox --
This has to end.
This has to end.
No...
What do you mean?
Why did they built it?
What's it all for?
Vox?
Do you know which way?
Machines?
Yes... Thank you.
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
This is the way in?
Oh, shut up.
Yes.
Yes...
My God... I saw this.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
What?
Last night.
I'm used to that.
Yes.
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
Because you'll never die.
We need your help.
Can you show us where they live?
How have you survived so long?
But you escaped.
Do you know where they live?
You know of them?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
Sir... have you a name?
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
What are you?
1899.
How did you know?!
Because...
I don't think that's going to happen.
I'm tired of running.
I know.
I'm a foolish man.
No...
No...
A man can change his history.
You took her because she helped me.
So you take their best...
Why?
I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.
Say I just come back again?
Why would you let me go back?
What?
It can't all be like this...
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
And what of the Eloi?
How?
How do you control the Morlocks?
As slaves.
Created?
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Alexander.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
I just love mechanical things.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
It's spectacular...
Why is it -- breaking up?
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
What's happening to the moon?!
I -- what are you?!
I have something for you...
Let them.
It's only a machine.
I've seen it.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
My God...
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
No... let's walk through the city.
Not here... alone.  Please.
I need... to talk to you.
Holding you... again.
You know I can't.
Got here as soon as I could.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
I know it's not a diamond but --
Hold on... I know I have it...
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
I mean... well... affection.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
I need to... um... talk to you.
Sorry... I was distracted.
What?
You know I can't.
Got here as soon as I could.
This... was my home.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Good night, David.
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
You won't say that in a week.
That's absurd --
I can't leave when I'm so close.
I can't do that --
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
You wouldn't believe me.
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
I live with it every minute of every day.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
Hiding?
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
For God's Sake, David --
Then why are you here?
I'm sorry, David.
I've been working.
Perseverance.
Oh?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
Nothing.
In the future, we'll be better.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
You sound like my father...
Where's the challenge in that?
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
God, and I'm running late --
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
I was not.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
I don't understand.
Sir...?
Thank you...
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Mara -- what -- ?!
Mara...?
Mara --
I could...
Yes... I suppose so.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
If you only knew...
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Yes.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Orion's belt...
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
How do you decide?
What are you?
Or mud carriers.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
What's it all for?
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
I can see Kalen's point.
And this is your "work"?
This is magnificent...
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
All of you?
Yes!
Yes.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Good night.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
You can see so many here.
Thank you...
I will...
Is he all right?
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
Why not?
More than 800,000 years.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
What makes you say that?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
Your husband is dead?
His curiosity is amazing.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Thank you.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
Yes...
That'll be all.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Tell him to go away --
Here?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Do you have it?!
Yes, sir.
Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
Sir --
No, sir --
And roosters.
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Imagine that.
Exactly correct, sir.
I see.
You won't even try?
Then it's time to change that --
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
You know that's not true.
What do you mean?!
We have to go after them, find where -- !
Where do they take them?!
I suppose so.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
I took a different route.
No...
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
"Eloi"?
I did...
