Never felt better.
I've been working out.
What?
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
No.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
I've changed a lot lately.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Does she have PMS?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Nearly four.
It's not just in my head.
What else is there?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Good. Except for PMS.
No, it was another woman.
Oh, on my wrist.
There was a sale.
At Victoria's Secret.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
What does that have to do with me?
Mom!
Jennifer?
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
Hello?
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
I wish I only had your problems.
I thought you and George were getting married.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
About Mark? Carlton?
The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London?"
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I think I already have.
So what do I do?
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
Guess she never found true love.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Peter keeps asking me out.
You're such a good friend.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
I think I just got my period.
Peter knows something.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
No.
You should have seen it erect.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
I could smell another woman on him.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
What? Why'd you do that?
Why not? There's been a murder.
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
Holy shit, I don't know.
Okay, I gotta go.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Oh no.
Shit, I guess I missed work.
I've been here. What day is it?
Hello?
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
I haven't gotten it yet.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
I put it down the garbage disposal.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
No you don't, believe me.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
It is so hot in here.
Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful."
What did he say?
You're just saying that.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Okay. I guess so.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
I looked like an Italian man!
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
What the hell is the tampon test?
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I wonder if he's married.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
My vision got worse again.
And my bra finally fits again.
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
No. I don't think so.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
Why would they exaggerate?
And he was ripped limb from limb?
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Maybe they have to pee.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
George bit you?
I think she broke the skin.
Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
Where are all the mediums?
I don't know.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
Or if there's a full moon.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Only to see.
You're just saying that.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
He hasn't said one word to me.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
He's a very talented musician.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Translation: a total geek.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
Uh huh. So pee.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
You don't have to pee.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
My apartment's just such a mess.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
What?
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
I'm really tired.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
That's great. Highly original.
I'm not really hungry after all.
Starving.
You're kidding, really?
I do development for TV movies.
I know.
Take your shower.
Mark.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
So pay them back and apologize.
This really isn't a good time.
It's Mark.
Where'd you get the bike?
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Yeah right... You better go.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
No.
You never say that.
Since when do you care?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
No.
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
A little.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
Your desk.
On your desk.
On your desk.
Here's a towel.
Okay.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
What about... those guys... I might have...
Worse than this?
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
Be careful!
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
How do you know?
Peter I love you too but...
Go away. I might hurt you.
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Hello?
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
They do? Oh no...
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
I love you too.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
Interesting possibility.
No, but thanks for the warning.
What's that supposed to mean?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
What happened?
No, I got it. It's okay.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
No, why?
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
Uh.... hi!
Everything okay?
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
My period? No.
What's wrong?
Okay, you busted me.
What are they for?
What are those?
Goodnight.
Yeah. Maybe.
I really gotta get going.
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Like what?
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Oh my god, by wolves?
I'm sorry.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
It's stupid.
Oh, it's nothing.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
Intriguing?
Are you following me?
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
We didn't have sex.
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
I ate a guy last night.
I think I'm a werewolf.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
No, I have a cat.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
What makes you think I was the last one?
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
No, take it.
No, I said it was our first date.
No, it was our first date.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
Oh my god, what happened?
