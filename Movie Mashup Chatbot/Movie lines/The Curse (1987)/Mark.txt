Wow.
Yeah?
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
It's a matter of life and death.
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
I'm working on it...
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Frida, you know you're it for me.
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Look what you did!
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
You look different. I mean you look good.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
