Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Can we get some service here?
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
You can't believe this bullshit.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
It's for you. Frida.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
She's just so... pathetic.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
