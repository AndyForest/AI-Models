Thanks.
I'm going to take a shower.
I know. The important thing is that it stop.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
I don't think you'll hurt me.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
You at least owe me the truth.
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
What? Is there someone else?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
Your breasts feel larger.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
What's with the squirt guns?
You didn't say it.
Is that how you feel?
Is it that funny?
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Except Mark of course.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
What happened?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
You had a date with Carlton?
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
A man killed in Central Park.
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Was there anything in that washer?
No. I was doing my laundry.
Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
Goodnight.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Briefs.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
No, she died when I was twelve.
My mom used to get PMS too.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
So what book did you buy?
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
You wanna get some coffee?
There's a lot of that going around.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
You busted me.
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
When's the last time you saw him?
He's been running money for the Mafia.
Why would you want to be a cop?
We can just take this pillowcase.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
What kind of animal?
Did we get those DNA tests back?
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
What makes her think that?
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
What are you talking about?
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
He means the last that we know of.
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
The park dude was missing an arm.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
We only live a few blocks apart.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
What?
Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
I told you she was innocent.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
He was found a few blocks away.
You're some catch Lloyd.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
