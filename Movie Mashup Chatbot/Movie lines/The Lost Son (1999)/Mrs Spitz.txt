Jah...
�10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
The �1,000 is on account.
When... I�m told he came here...
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard�s address, keys and other things you might need.
No. And before you ask, no, he�s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Do what, Mr Lombard?
You wouldn�t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Must I speak to you in French?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
What if it is?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his.
