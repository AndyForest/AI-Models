It�s a good guess...
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I�d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady�s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as �Never Forget�. Over the years we�re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn�t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what�s your business with these Spitzes?
