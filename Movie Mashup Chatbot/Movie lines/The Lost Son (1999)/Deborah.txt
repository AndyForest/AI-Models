I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
You wouldn�t understand.
I don�t know. Everyone�s dead...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
The staff don�t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn�t take any more...
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
No. Not us...
Do you think we�d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They�ll tell you. Call them!
What are you doing? You can�t. I...
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That�s when he hit me, and told me he�d killed my brother... �You don�t know what you�ve done,� he said.  �We�re in deep trouble,� he said. �We,� he said. �We.�  We�d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
I didn�t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you�d been back.  That we�d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn�t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
My husband didn�t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
You seem to know what you�re talking about.
Should I?
Simplify and damn.
Here we go again.
Something like that.
Something like that.
I didn�t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
...We�re turning in circles.
You splendid bastard...
You bastard...
Why do I feel I needn�t answer that?
Good.
Think what you like. But don�t presume to understand.
I didn�t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I�ve known for five years. He�s known I�ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn�t speak about...
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
You�re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he�d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don�t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didn�t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
Leon could still have hung himself.
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don�t you accuse me of killing my brother?
...You-you spoke to him?
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself.
My brother hung himself.
No!
How... When did you...
Huh! Don�t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Whatever the reason, I�m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you�d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you�re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Have you finished?
Why... I don�t know what you�re talking about.
You�re mad...
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Sorry?
I... If you don�t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. There�s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
I... Well, we�re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it�s late and with the funeral...
I�m really sorry you were not called...
When did you get back?
Mr Lombard...
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Paul Lamont...?
Yes... You woke me up... It�s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Are we understood?
I�m impressed. That information could have cost me �20,000.
Who is Friedman?
You lost my money?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
I still don�t buy your story but I figured it can�t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Laurence!
No. You�re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Get out of my house. You�re fired, Mr Lombard.
No. The question now is how long it�s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
How dare you...  You don�t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Oh no. You�ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Excuse me?
What... What are you talking about?
You... You found that at Leon�s?
Disney! How inter...
Anything is possible.
Can it be that easy?
Oh-oh! Touch�, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don�t. You might get confused speaking of things you don�t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you�ve done what we are paying you for.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I won�t comment on the time but you�ll understand if I don�t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps it wasn�t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn�t want anyone to interfere with his �Art�!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn�t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over �1,000 to get rid of him.
That depends what you�re looking at.
Now you know why you�re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
