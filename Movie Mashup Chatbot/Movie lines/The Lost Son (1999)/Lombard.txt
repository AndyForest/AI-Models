Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says �closed to the public�, doesn�t it?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why�s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there�s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother�s death.
No. Thank you. I�ll be fine...
You wouldn�t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress�s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
When will they be back?
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
That might depend on where you�re going.
That�s right.
The dead can wait.
Why the hell couldn�t you divorce the man?
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
What do you suggest?
So you did talk about it, huh?
Get to the point, will you...
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother�s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
You know something? I�ve just seen so much ugliness I don�t think I�d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I�d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that�s the way you want it.
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
To get me killed...?
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it�s never that complicated really.
Don�t you believe in simplicity?
Where is that?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Something like that?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier�s being tailed?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
And you still haven�t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Five years of it. Surely, you�d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Is there anything to understand?
I don�t.
One just doesn�t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
You don�t say.
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. He�d never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You�d have been ready for me when I turned up with �Sleeping Beauty�. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. �Not Leon,� you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn�t say �My God!�, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. �Not Leon.� Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I�d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at �15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn�t you?
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis�s little secret, didn�t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn�t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid�s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn�t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? �Leon does his own prints. Wouldn�t want anyone to interfere with his �Art��.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it�s the way you say them...
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn�t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Leon didn�t hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
Leon�s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon�s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I�d exceeded his expectations.
Adonis thought your brother�s body�d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn�t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He�s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
What do you mean, �No�, Mrs De Moraes?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What�s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother�s disappearance, didn�t you?
I guess the news you�d sent me after Friedman didn�t go down too well, eh?
When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it woman�s intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
You know he�d have had him killed, don�t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
I�ve had a long and unpleasant day. I�m tired and I�m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon�s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven�t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don�t learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn�t suit you! Who knew I�d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who�d want to make sure it didn�t fall into the wrong hands?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can�t satisfy him?
What�s in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
Black suits you.
Aren�t you curious to know about Friedman?
You�re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Why don�t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I�ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Are you all right?
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Have you got a pen?
You do want me to keep the job, don�t you, Mrs De Moraes?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don�t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They�re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I�m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
You drive a hard bargain.
Couldn�t Nazi hunters do the job?
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Perhaps I should come back when you�re...
Excuse me?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother�s not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he�d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
I can�t tell you that yet. But he�s being well looked after.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don�t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he�s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I�ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I�m here at such a late hour. I need �20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
You seem surprised. Could it be you don�t think that badly of him after all?  You needn�t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
There�s more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for �15,000.
It�s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I�m told it retails at around �4,000.  I see you don�t require a definition.
I found this at your brother�s.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
I don�t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
I�m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother�s in trouble.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The �1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
And that is the last time any...
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Can you tell me how you spell...
A call box? That�s odd. Where exactly?
Yes. I�m trying to reach a friend but I can�t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
The word for those things is croissants.
Croissants. Like that...
Croissants.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
They�d never let me go. And you�d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
What about your friendly cop?
It�s up to you whether they walk or not.
Then find another way.
I�m finished here and I�m tired, Emily. You shouldn�t be here. Now don�t make it worse.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Do you know a friendly cop?
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
Some Italian I picked up back there. He�s in the boot of the Mustang.
Friedman�s dead... They killed him...
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There�s a lot of people back there. They�re holding a seminar. Trafficking�s the past, breeding the future...
Who�s the guy? Who�s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I�d have had to kill him.
I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldn�t come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There�s a dirt track with a �Closed to the public� sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven�t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Get a pen and don�t ask any questions.
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Thank you. But I think I�ll go to bed. It�s been a long day.
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
A criminal?
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we�re doing here?
I�m sure I�ll find a way.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
I wouldn�t mind. Thank you.
I know where to look.
I thought you�d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There�s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I�d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
No. A poor little rich boy who thought he�d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
Yeah.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn�t have any. I used a British passport. My name�s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
Well, I�d sooner mug an old lady...
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
You�re sure you won�t sit down, Miss Stewart?
You wouldn�t have a cigarette, would you?
Europe...  France. I�m French but I live in London...  ... England.
... Fine. I�ll go for the safe place.
I see. How much?
Tomorrow?
What about an untrained pup, white...
Yes... Good, good...
Yeah.
What sort have you got?
Why?
I saw the ad at George�s.  I�m passing through town and I�m in a hurry.
I�m calling about the puppies.
Where is it?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
What about the staff?  They�re in on what�s going on, aren�t they?  How many of them?
What�s the Ambassador?
How many of you scumbags are here?
What company?
And who does Friedman work for?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
Where are the kids?
Where are we?
Where?
What�s this place? A hotel of some kind?
Ever seen him before?
Who�s the money man?
...On holiday?
Where is he?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
You�re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Where is the Austrian?
On the bed!
You sure you passed on my message?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Can I have the reception desk, please.
I�ll call again.
Thank you, Jane.
Carlos De Moraes?
Hello, Jane. It�s me.
I�d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can�t, don�t worry about it. I�ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I�m in a hurry.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you�re my secretary, all right?
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It�s important.
It�s not.
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I�d given you and then got back, remember? I can�t find it. Do you know where it is?
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, tr�s bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommand�mes services �quelqu�un r�cemment... Vous �tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie...
Bye bye, Jane. And don�t be naughty.
I�ve got work tonight, Jane.
Well, I hope you�re not too heartbroken and...
It�s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
Should I?
La what?
Good.
No.
How are you, Jane?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy�s education.
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
My rates...
I�m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
Any friends?
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
Then why aren�t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
I presume you checked your son�s apartment...
I didn�t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Check with your son�s bank. Banks don�t usually give out information about their customers.
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
I take it your son is called Leon?
Look Mrs Spitz... I don�t know to whom I�m indebted for the recommendation but... I�m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
Okay. Recommended...
Didn�t you say I came recommended?  That�s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Recommended?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn�t like to think I�d kept you waiting for nothing.
I hope it�s not too significant.
May I...?
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
The Hyatt...? What�s that?
Trying to say something, Martin?
What is?
You seem very sure about that.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You�ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he�s using?
Is this Friedman?
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
I�m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Maybe I don�t.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let�s go...
Shut up and drive!
Don�t jump any red lights.
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
Where is Friedman?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Let�s go.
Is my money in there?
Does it matter?
Anything at all?
What happens now?
What are you talking about?
What is it?
Three o�clock.
Yeah.
I�ll be alone.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I�d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
An Austrian.
The lady�s not a friend. She�s a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
I don�t recollect mentioning a friend.
Have you?
Should I come back in five minutes?
Yes. You wouldn�t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Oh. This is... We�d arranged to meet tonight and I�m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Good. You needn�t worry about the Austrian anymore. He�s dead. I�ll be in touch.
How�s the boy doing?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
I�ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
What�s the date?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon�s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon�s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he�d have found you before I did.
I can�t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What�s your sister�s number?
Is she on the phone?
Who else knows about the boy?
Do you know Leon�s parents names?
I�m afraid I don�t understand.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Good reasons?
Did Leon tell you why he didn�t want the police involved, Rhian?
Shut up!
Haven�t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I�d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon�s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Can I get up now?
Should I be?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
It�s wet. Will this do?
How are you, Rhian?
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn�t appeal to you...
I�d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Los Angeles?
I... How long have I been here?
No...
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Could that be Camden Market?
Would you know where I might reach her?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
What about his girlfriend?
I know his work better than I know him.
I take it you don�t know where he is, then?
Uh-huh.
Excuse me?
If you can, send me a receipt.
I don�t have your credentials, Nathalie.
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Le montage, l�emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors� stuff. How much would it cost me?
Alors?
Mon bureau co�tait trop cher.
Tu sais o� me trouver.
Viens.
What�s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr�- pubescents.
Don�t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Shut up and walk...
You�re sure he said his caller was a man?
What sums?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Try again, and this time be polite.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
I think you�d rather not know what I think.
So why didn�t he?
Are you telling me Friedman didn�t tell you I was here looking for him?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Why did you kill him?
Why did you kill Friedman?
The acid bath?
Three...
Five seconds. Then you die.
Gluck.
Okay, shitbag. I�m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Mossad?
Are they still operative?
They lost their son. Why?
Moreau? C�est moi. Alors...
