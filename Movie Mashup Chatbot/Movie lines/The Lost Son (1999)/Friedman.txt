Have the money ready by 11am. We�ll call you.
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
I�m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
How much of a hurry are you in?
So, what are you looking for?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
This is a bad line.
May I have your phone number?
Have we done business before?
