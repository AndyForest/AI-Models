Yes. How did...
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Your secretary, huh!
Piss off!
Well, I�m sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. I�ve got the week off and he�s come to stay.
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it�s there with...
Hello there. How�s the flat. I cleaned...
I came to feed your fish. I didn�t know...
She�s pretty... See you, huh?
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that�s what they do to their employees, isn�t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people�s lives. Thanks for the lift!
Oh no. I�m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Oh... We split up.
So you haven�t seen the film, then?
I don�t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
�La collectionoose�. It�s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It�s on TV tonight and as I�m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it�s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director�s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Have you heard of a French film called �La Collectionoose�?
Yes. But my boss reckons you�d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It�d cost you about �100 but he said it�d be worth it.  Of course, you�d need a partner to register. But that�s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
Must be your lucky day then. I�ve got your accounts - you don�t owe much tax for last year.
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn�t intrude, did I?
