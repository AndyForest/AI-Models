Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Hyatt... Friedman�s... at the Hyatt...
Dying without ever reaching the top...
I told you... The rabble, it�s me...  Huh... It�s sad.
You�re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy�s not one of Friedman�s...
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Huh... I�m sure there�d be lots of takers.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they�re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can�t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Huh. I�d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the client�le. Get rid of them and we�re out of business.
You�re out of your mind. What�s the idea?
This car needs petrol.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Look, I don�t think you�re fully aware of what you�re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don�t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Clients come and go.
Am I supposed to know him?
I don�t know what your problem is, but...
Uh-huh. You could�ve waited for me inside.
Problems?
Vous �tes Fran�ais?
Anything at all. I presume you won�t want to take the boy with you when you�re finished?  There�s a �500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
The room�s yours for 24 hours. It�s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
We conclude our transaction.
