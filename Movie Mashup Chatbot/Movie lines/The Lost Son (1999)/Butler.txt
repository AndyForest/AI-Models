Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
I work here, sir. I�m here most of the time.
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
I�m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
Good afternoon. De Moraes�s residence.
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes� majordomo. They are expecting you.
Will you please come with me?
