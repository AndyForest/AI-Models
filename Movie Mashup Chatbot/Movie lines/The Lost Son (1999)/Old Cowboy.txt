Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world, I�ll stay in mine. So long, Mister.
Barstow�s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you�re heading, I reckon somebody�ll pick you up.
I�m sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldn�t let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until you�re told otherwise.  And for what it�s worth, I wouldn�t try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. I�d sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Huh... I guess you ain�t quite ready for civilisation yet... I�ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you�re on your way.
Three days and that�s three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
I didn�t think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with...  I don�t wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know I�d have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
And you ain�t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
