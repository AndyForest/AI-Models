Fine...
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
... No. In fact, I�d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn�t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
... No.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn�t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... �Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,� Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
Er... Yes...
The nineteenth... How come you didn�t know?
He�d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... �Sleeping Beauty�. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn�t watch...
I�m sorry. It�s just you don�t look local...
Oh, I... She just moved. I�ve got her new... It�s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
Yes...You-you�re not going to take Shiva away?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
They�re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It�s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there�s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that�s just one of Leon�s dark delusions...
Yeah... But he didn�t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent�s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
That�s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn�t take on another child, that he�d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn�t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he�s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people�s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon�s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
He just said he had good reasons.
We didn�t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he�s terrified of men, so...
You-you�re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I�m in London. That�s all.
You thought wrong. I haven�t seen Leon for months.
...Leon�s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn�t know where I live.
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
What�s a French private investigator doing here?
A private investigator... You�re not Austrian?
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger�s on the trigger, you hear!
Shut up! Where�s your wallet?
Where�s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
