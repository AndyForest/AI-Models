Yeah. Why? You�re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don�t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That�s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Oh. That�d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
What about which girlfriend?
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain�t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of �em.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don�t know Leon, do you?
No shit... Well, I�m afraid I can�t help you.
I hear you�re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon�s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Welcome to the club.
