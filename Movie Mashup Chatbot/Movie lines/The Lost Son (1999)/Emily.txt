Huh! And they say charity�s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I�m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But he�s a good guy. He�ll listen to you. He won�t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
...I�m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that�s who I am. Do you get what I�m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Damn it! You can�t fucking walk away from this!
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god�s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I�ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it�ll be too late.
That-that won�t do. That�s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that�s the way...
We�re both thinking the same thing, right?
Italian? The Mafia...?
So who... Who�s the man? Where is he?
What...?
Look, you don�t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn�t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who�s the guy? The Austrian?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
What am I to do with the packages if...
Don�t fall asleep with your hair wet.
Right... Well, I�ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son�s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There�s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you�re hungry.
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn�t I hear you right?
Did you not enter this country illegally?
It�s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn�t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
How come you�re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Like you�ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy�s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
A recent acquisition. We�ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat�s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
There�ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it�s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won�t be for a couple of hours.
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
You don�t know why he�s come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
By your Austrian?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can�t you go back there?
Okay. The woman just can�t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can�t you go to your Embassy?
You...  Jesus Christ!
I can�t believe this...  What�s coming now, eh? If I don�t pay all Hell�s gonna break loose, is that it?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
I�m fine standing, thank you.
I don�t smoke. If you could get to the point...
You�re a long way from home...
May I ask where you�re from, Mr Lamont?
Shit! Fuck! What�s fucking wrong with people!  I�m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!
No. You�re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
That�s right. Where�s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney�s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
