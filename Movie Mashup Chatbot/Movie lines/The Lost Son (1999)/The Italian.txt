Huh. I�m a businessman. What are you, eh?
What you gonna do? Kill me?
When they realise I�m missing...
That�s what he said...
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn�t need your confession...
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who�d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
I can only tell you what he told us...
That�s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you�re up to, eh, French-fuck?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn�t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only �cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
What do you think, huh?
If he had, you�d be dead.
That�s just it. The sonofabitch didn�t ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasn�t gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn�t you know?
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It�s wrong. Fucking wrong.
Huh! You�ve been around, eh?
You�re the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what�s left of him...
Gluck�s dead, you sonofabitch!
Fuck...
Figlio di puttana. You�re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Who?  I don�t know who the fuck you�re talking about, sunshine.
