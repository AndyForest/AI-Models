It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
I don't know.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
You don't have a key?
Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Oh, as long as we're here...
Is there much more of this torture?
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
Viridian?
Gooood!
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
I thought I saw something.
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
Their wedding clothes.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
Why not?
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
