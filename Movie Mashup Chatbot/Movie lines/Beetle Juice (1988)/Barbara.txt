Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
3:30 I guess.
Just a hunch.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
You can build another one... with her.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
He might have hurt somebody.
Who did the sushi?
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
Honey.  Let's go.
She's only fourteen...
Maybe we should knock first?
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
What happened?
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Here's something.
Then it should be here.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
You know you're really a pretty girl.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
I feel really stupid.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
That little girl saw us.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
At least we won't have to worry about her.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
What's she doing here?
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
I don't think we survived the crash.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
That's how long you were gone.
Two hours.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
I am sitting.
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
Oh... I'm sorry...
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Adam!
Wave at the lion.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Oh no.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
Just one daughter.
Just get some people out of our house.
We're...
What about Betelgeuse?
About what?
Our cemetery?
What do you mean?  What's he do?
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
No.
Yes.
We're very unhappy.
We need help.  We deserve help.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
How'd you do on the science test?
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
No, Lydia, we're dead.
No, wait!
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
Tell the truth.
We're practicing.
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
