I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
We're rich in what really matters.
No, Jane.
All right.
Give or take a year.
What time is it?
What...?
What makes you think she likes me?
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Little black party dresses?
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
I didn't --
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
And your sushi was remarkable.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
... acts like she's thirty-five.
I guess we open it.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Of course I did.
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Where are your skulls and bones?
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
How long do you suppose we were waiting?
My God, we're back where we started.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
Wait.
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
What about this Beetle guy?
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
That's all we need.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
Not really...  what's this?
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
<u>You</u> left me.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
Oh, honey, we may need that.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
They make gypsies look good.
That's my girl!
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Won't?  Or can't?
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
But I'm not hungry, are you?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Maybe this is heaven.
Cabin fever, hon?
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
This is going to take some time.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
Anything happen while I was away?
... Hmmm?
What?
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
You'd better sit down, hon.
How's your arm?
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Almost.
She's ready.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
Did you get the paint?
What is going on?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
We were trying to scare your mother.
Nobody else can.
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
What?
Aren't you scared?
We're ghosts.
Wait for who?
Help vouchers?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
W... We didn't know how to make one.
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
This is <u>my</u> town.
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
Can you scare them off?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
You don't kill anyone.
Aren't you dead?
<u>Out</u>.
Well, we didn't know --
Handbook?  When...?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
We tried.
Are you available?
