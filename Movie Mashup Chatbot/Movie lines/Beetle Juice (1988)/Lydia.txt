Oh puh-leeze!
So can I?
I got an A!
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
Really.  I don't know.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
Is this like a trick question?
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
Step... mother.
Life is just... too awful.
I want to be dead too.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
Your qu...?  But you're...
W... What is it?
... I will.
You've got to help them.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
God, you're anatomically correct!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
Beetle!
I don't know what that signal means.
Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
Three syllables.
Yes.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Yeah.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
I think so.
I want to get in.
Are you a spirit too?
Where'd they go?
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
They're... not here anymore.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
I cannot believe this.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Stepmother's...
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
I'm lonely.
Stepmother.
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Delia hates it.
I'm sorry already.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
It wasn't a joke.
I saw some ghosts.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Any particular kind?
I say let's keep it the way it is.
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Is this the key to the attic?
What happened to the people who used to live here?
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
Their wedding clothes.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
The attic.
They don't want to come down.
Otho, that's terrible.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
