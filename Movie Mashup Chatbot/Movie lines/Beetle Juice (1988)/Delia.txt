Not these people!  They are ruthless!
I think she's in with them.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Otho'll know what to do.
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
What's happening to them?
Are they still here, Otho?
Look at the tiny figures.
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Maybe Charles does.
Attic space.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
Viridian?  What is...?
What do you think?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Okay?
What's wrong?
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
