Now, let's get rolling!
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
You're the dead.
All right.  Who are you?
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
nan
Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
So... You're ready for me now?
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
Just <u>say</u> it.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
That's it!
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
Good girrrl!
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
No, dummy.  Two.
Of course you do.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
They're dead.
