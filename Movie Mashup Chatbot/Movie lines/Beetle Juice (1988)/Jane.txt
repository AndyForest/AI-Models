Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  You don't have to answer now.  He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  You take your vacation, Adam.  Say 'bye!
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
You'll be rich!
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
Well, I just placed a call to your mother.  She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
Hellooo!  How's school?
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
