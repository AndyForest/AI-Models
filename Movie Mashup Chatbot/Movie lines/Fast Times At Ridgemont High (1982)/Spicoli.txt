Easy, mon.
There it is!
On the ledge?
I can't find it, mon!
Totally.
Something happened to them, mon.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!
Ugh.
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
Totally.
That's me, Merv.
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
I don't go at all.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
I've been swimming, Merv.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Just be glad you're all right.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
What the fuck is this guy doing?
All right.
Naw. Any good?
Then don't hassle it.
I thought he was out of town.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
All right! Oh, yeah!
You're gonna flunk me?!
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
I don't know. I guess so.
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
You better save some for me, you swine!
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I don't know.
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I couldn't make it in time.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
You just ripped my card in two!
That's the name they gave me.
Can I come in?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
