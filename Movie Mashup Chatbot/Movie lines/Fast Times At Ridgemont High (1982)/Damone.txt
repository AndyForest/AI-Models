All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
All right, I take it back.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
What? Now?
What's going on?
Hello.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Oh. Hi.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
What? Are you all right?
Let's continue.
You first.
No. Are you crazy?
You're a really good kisser.
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
Come on...
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Well...
I know what I look like.
I don't know.
Do you have any ice tea?
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
What a guy.
Get a ride with somebody.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
So what makes you so sensitive?
Sensitive -- what is that?
Whatever you say, Rat.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Fine. Get lost.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
Poor guy.
Well, I've gotta be running.
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
I'm really pretty busy...
Did you go home and get it?
Mark. What happened to your date?
Yo.
You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
All right. Pay attention.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Ace the jacket.
Hey, Rat.
There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
I would. Yeah.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Did you get her name?
Did you get her number?
All right... where did you see her?
It's definitely your mama.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
You should work for yourself.
