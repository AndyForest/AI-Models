Aloha, Spicoli.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
If you graduate.
Well, you'll find out next year.
What's that?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Yes.
Mr. Spicoli?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
Really?
What class?
