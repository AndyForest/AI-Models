Is this your first time?
No. I mean back to your home.
I think I better take you home.
Are you really nineteen?
It's very warm out tonight.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
All right, the point it is.
How about the point?
Where do you feel like going?
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
No problem.
How about your phone number?
You look like you could still be in high school.
