And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Not if you're over sixteen.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
Yes.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Yeah, like maybe never.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
He's not coming.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
What do you want?
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
That little prick.
That little prick.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
What?
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
It couldn't be.
What do you think it is?
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
No.
I think they're both virgins.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
No. But it's a nice idea.
Climax together.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Hey! That's my line!
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
You'll always remember your first time.
Was it great?
Just kidding. About 10cc.
There's nothing to it.
What's the big deal?
What variables?
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
I know.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Believe it.
If I didn't have a fiancï¿½ in Chicago, I'd go for it.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Don't you like him?
How's it going.
