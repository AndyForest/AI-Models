It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
You're losing it, Damone.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
No Damone. I don't understand.
Chicken!
Really.
Okay. See ya.
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Damone! You come here?
Damone, are you there?
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Damone. It's Mark.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Yeah?
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Really?
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
No. It's too soon.
No.
She's in my biology class.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Really?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I'll get you the notes.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Well... it's getting kind of late.
...I've got to go home.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Sure.
I don't know.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Naw. I don't mind.
No. That's okay.
Where's your brother?
Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
Aren't your parents asleep?
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Two more Cokes.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Oh yeah.
Excellent.
Do you know what you want?
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
Sure thing.
Oh... yes.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
You keep them.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Two Cokes.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
