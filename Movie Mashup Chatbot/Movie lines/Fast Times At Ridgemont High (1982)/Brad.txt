I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
You want to work at Carl's?
Arnold. What's happening?
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Don't worry about it.
Of course.
Later.
First door on your left!
It's the first door on your left!
It's the first door on your left.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
This is how I dress all the time.
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
All right, then. It's your secret.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
See you later.
Does Mom know you have company?
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
Are you still a virgin?
I didn't say that.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Why?
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Well... it's true.
Where did you hear that?
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
They're not home yet.
I take out the garbage.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Hey-yo.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Sis.
Yes, sir.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Okay, Dennis.
But they weren't mine.
They were left over from the last shift.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
