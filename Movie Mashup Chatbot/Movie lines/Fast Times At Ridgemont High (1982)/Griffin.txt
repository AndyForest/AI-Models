What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Are you going to ride that wave?
Who's that?

I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
How often do you go?
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
How've you been?
