I counted to three, honey.
That wasn't my doing...
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Uh-huh.
Well, we need that ring.
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
That's not my ring.
That's not my ring.
That's good, honey.
That's right, honey.
No weddin'.
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
