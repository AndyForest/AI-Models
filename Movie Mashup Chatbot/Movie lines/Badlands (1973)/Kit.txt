You expect me to believe that?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
You don't mind?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Can't afford to take chances.
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
He said not to tell.
Well, he's gone.
Okay.
Okay.
That's what he told you, huh?
She plays the clarinet, too.
Where'd you get them antlers?
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
What you been doing?
How you doing, Cato?
What do you mean?
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
I used to throw trash for the City.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
Thanks.
Tom...
Sure.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
They're okay.
Mmmmm.
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Cause I can't allow it.
No, you're not either.
What for?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
Hi.
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
Yeah.
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Sure is pretty.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Course it's too bad about your dad.
What?
Have you got a better idea?
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
Everybody loves trout.
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
I don't blame him.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Positive?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Excuse me.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
You tired?
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Think I got 'em?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
I got him in the stomach.
Look at all this junk.
Put that down. It's dirty.
He was nervous.
Yeah, me too.
How you doing?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
You said that once already... Too late now.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
I can look and see.
I came in the front.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
Well, that's the point, stupid.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
You know what I think?
Don't ask me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
Somebody else is going to get it.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
It's your play.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Yeah?
Why not?
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
You're a redhead.
Bring it along.
You want to go for a ride?
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Quit my job.
Hi.
There you go.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
He'll say that?
Sure.
What?
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Sure.
What's that?
Well, he didn't have it last night.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Hi.
Okay, no monkey business then.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
This your place?
Hi.
Git.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
You didn't walk out here.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
No.
You tossed my hat out the window.
Think I'll take the juice?
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
Hi.
