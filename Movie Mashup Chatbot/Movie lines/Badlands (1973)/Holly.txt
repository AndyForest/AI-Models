Does he bite?
What do you feed him?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
What'd they look like?
Don't you ever get bored around here?
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
You love him?
What's your friend's name?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Yeah.
I just don't want to go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
What?
No.
How about over here?
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
It was going too fast.
I'm serious.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
That's Montana over there.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."

No.
Don't.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
I don't want a steak.
Yeah.
What'd you put him in there for?

I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Why?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Are you sure?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
How bad off is he?
Don't call me stupid.
But it would hurt.
What?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Is that all there is to it?
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
I don't care.
No.
My stomach's growling.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
What a nice place.
Okay.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
I know.
Well, I got homework.
I don't know.
Something mi trabajo.
Spanish.
Great.
Well, stop the world.
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
Nothing.
Yeah.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Can I be honest?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
That's my father. I got to run.
Doing what?
You still in school?
It's okay.
What for?
Holly.
No.
