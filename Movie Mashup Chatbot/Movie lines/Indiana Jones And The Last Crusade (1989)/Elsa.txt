I can reach it. I can reach it...
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
I never expected to see you again.
All I have to do is scream.
You do.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
You came back for the book? Why?
How did you get here?
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
How do you know?
What are you going to do?
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
No?
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
The Grail Diary.
What were they looking for?
My room!
You said go between them!
What?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
What's that?
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Are you sure?
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Lower me down.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Find something?
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
In that case, I permit you.
I usually don't.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
I knew it was you --
Doctor Jones?
