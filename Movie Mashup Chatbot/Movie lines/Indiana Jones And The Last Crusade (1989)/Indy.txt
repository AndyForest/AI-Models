It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
I'm going after Dad.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
How's the head?
Dad was onto something here!
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
That doesn't look much like a library.
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
Ah, Venice...
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Do you believe, Marcus?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Venice, Italy!
Dad?
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
Your treat.
All my life!
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Marcus!  I did it!
How dare he?!
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
I'm through!
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
DONOVAN!
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Yes?
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
An old man's dream.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
Where did this come from?
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
All I have to do is squeeze.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
My father didn't want it incinerated.
Where is it? I want it.
So it did.
This one. I think he's in here.
Don't know. Think of something.
What do you know about this place?
No. You like the way I do things.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
At least I let you tag along.
Uh-huh.
This.
Mine, too.
I said don't go between them!
I said go around!
Don't wander off.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
It must be one of these...
Pretty sure.
The Ark of the Covenant.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Bingo.
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
It would make me very happy.
I usually don't either.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Yes?
Yes, sir!  Haaa!
Uh-huh.
Ready?
I like Indiana.
Junior?! Dad...
What did you find, Dad?
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
"J".
The penitent man is humble...
The penitent man is humble before God.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
Dad?!
Get out of there, Dad!
Dad?
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
Dad, we're well out of range.
This could be close.
It happens to me all the time.
I know, Dad!
Thanks.
Dad, are we hit?!
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Fly... yes. Land... no.
What does that mean?
Well... I can't think of anything.
Dad, how can you?
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
When?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
I was the next man.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Relax.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
What about Marcus?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Booby traps?
What final challenge?
All right Dad -- tell me.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Brody's this way.
What?
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Dad!
I'm out, Dad!
Head for the fireplace!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
What???
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
Try and burn through the ropes.
My lucky charm.
Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
How did you she was a Nazi?
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
No! Don't Shoot!
I came here to save you.
Will you take it easy!
Look, can we discuss this later?
Well, uh...
Yeah?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
There were rats, Dad.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Well, what was left of him.
Found it.
Right.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I came to get you! What do you think?
Don't call me that, please.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
It's important!
Dad!
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
That was seven hundred years ago.
Who are you?
Where's my father?
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
No camels!
I don't need camels.
I'm going after those horses.
Come on -- come on!
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
And why were you trying to kill me?
Who are you?
All right! Where's my father
This is your last chance.
Then we'll die.
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Why are you trying to kill us?
