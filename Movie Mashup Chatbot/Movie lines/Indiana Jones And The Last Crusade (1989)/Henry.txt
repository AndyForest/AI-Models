Got lost in his own museum, huh?
The Name of God...
The Word of God...
It's war.
What?
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
Marcus!
After you, Junior.
Ready.
We named the dog Indiana.
What did you find, Junior?
Me?... Illumination.
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Penitent. Penitent...
The penitent man. The penitent...
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Junior...
You call this archaeology?
Now, who are all these people?
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
This is intolerable!
It's a new experience for me.
Those people are trying to kill us!
Nice landing.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
What happens at eleven o'clock?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
I don't know. We'll find out.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
Very well. I'm here now.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Ships that pass in the night...
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Good.
What did you get?
Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
Marcus would agree with me.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
My Diary's in Berlin.
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
...the solution presents itself.
This is intolerable!
Oh.
What?
What?
What?
And the chair.
The floor's on fire! See?!
I ought to tell you something.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
What am I looking for?
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
So did I.
She talks in her sleep.
Umh?
Don't worry. He won't.
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
You did!!
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
They want my diary.
Rats?
If only I could have been with you.
...you did it.
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
He was actually there? You saw him?
I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
Through the library?
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
Good point.
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Thank God!
I'll never forgive myself --
Oh, it breaks the heart.
But what are you doing here?
It is you Junior!
Junior!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Out!
