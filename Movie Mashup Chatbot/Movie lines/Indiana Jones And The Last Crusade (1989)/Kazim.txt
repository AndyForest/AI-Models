The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
My name is Kazim.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.

My soul is prepared. How's yours?
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
No.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
