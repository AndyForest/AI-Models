May we go home now, please?
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
Yes.
Yes.
My reputation precedes me.
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
What about you?
Yes. Now we know.
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Where?
It looks like a converted church.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
I'll tell him we'll take two.
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
What is it?
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Yes. My treat.
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
All your life.
You've got it!
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Look what you did!
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
Henry, the pen --
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Arghhh! Oh!
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
Schneider?
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
