Just like that?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Is that what you think?
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
What for? To play Fats again?
Aw, Eddie.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I'll tell you what -- take her along.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
I asked around.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Okay, here...  Be a damn fool.
Go to hell.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
You don't need a drink.
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Get with what?
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Eddie...
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Quit. He's too good.
In the gut, I mean.
How do you feel?
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
It's quiet.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
I don't want it.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
Why?
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
