Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Thank you.
How?
You bastard.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
For whom and for what?
You know what's good for him?
Do we need words?
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
And a fact is a fact.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
I'm ready.
I've never been to Louisville.
No, I'm fine.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
I'm a little tired.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Why?
He went off someplace.
Fifty-seven.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Why should I?
Leave now.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
No, I want to walk.
Sure. Let's go home.
A week? A year?
For how long?
What do you want to tell me?
What is it, Eddie?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
I feel pretty.
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
Yes, I'm glad.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
I love you.
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Does it bother you? What he said?
Is that what makes a winner?
Is he a winner?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Why did he tell you?
Would he know?
A loser?
No. You?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
What happened?
Who is it?
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
Give it back to me.
Give it to me.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
You going out?
Do you want me to go?
From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
No, why should I? It's yours.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Oh, it's not bad.
Oh, cut my finger.
Eggs. How do you like them?
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
I'm getting treatments right here.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Mm hmm.
You want to go with me?
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
At school. It's Thursday.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Why?
What time is it?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Why did you do that?
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
No.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
I drink.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I'm not.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I used to be an actress.
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
Do you always ask so many questions?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Fair.
Thanks. I will.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Eight o'clock.
What bus?
Fine, thanks.
Since four.
What?
Yes.
