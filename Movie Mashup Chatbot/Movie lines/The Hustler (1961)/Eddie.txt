Huh?
Give me a bottle of beer.
You look different... More relaxed.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
No.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Next game, ten bucks.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Mm hmm.
Yep.
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Fifty per cent?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Tell her what?
I got time, Bert.
I wanna walk.
What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
Please don't get off me now.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
They're fine.
I'll beat him the next game.
I can beat him.
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
When do I raise the bet?
How do we stand?
Sure.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
What's the matter? What happened?
Well, I win sometimes.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
Where?
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
Hey, whaddya say something like that for?
Fine.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Here, I got it.
What's that supposed to mean?
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
How good is he?
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
I been thinking.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Where do I sign?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
You know everybody, don't you?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Hi. How's business?
Now, when did you adopt me?
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Kiss off.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
You think I can lose?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
For who?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Why?
To do what?
Thanks for the drink.
I told you. I got drunk.
What's that supposed to mean?
Whaddya been so far?
In that case, you owe me another drink.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
A thousand.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
Maybe he knows how to drink.
I got drunk.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
You being cute?
What is?
I lost twenty bucks.
Yeah? Why?
Thought you only drank milk.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Deal.
Make it twenty.
Okay?
What did he say?
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Hey, mister.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
He's my partner.
Yeah, that's right.
The expensive kind.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
You name it, we shoot it.
Who's he?
Maybe. You want to play?
Yeah. Just like that.
Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
Yeah, that's what I think.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
HOW MUCH?!
Oh yeah? Where?
With what?
I told you you'd get your money back.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
Talk to me, Charlie.
A son.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Is this all we got left?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Give me a drink, will ya?
You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
How much we got?
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
I feel tight -- but good.
Fast and loose, man.
Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can walk out with ten grand in one night? Jeez, you know, I can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
Well... well, now.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Whaddya mean?
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Yeah. Sure.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Yeah, sure has.
For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now.
There it is. I'm broke.
Okay?
Oh no, nothing for me.
I thought we came here to play pool.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
What time?
That's right. When?
When?
How much?
Now and then. Why, do you?
Glad to meet you.
No, no more for me.
Gimme ten bucks.
What's the limit?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Who's he?
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
You quittin', friend?
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Call it.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Shoot.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Couple of bucks.
You're a pretty good player.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
How much you playin' for?
Hi.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Shut up.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Go on back to the hotel.
Well, what's the matter?
Just for luck.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Where's Bert?
I'll be up later.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Oh, grow up.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Come here. Come on, now.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Oh, I don't know.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
First time for everything.
Well, what's so funny?
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
You glad?
You need the words?
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
Well, what else does?
Well, he owns things.
He's a gambler.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
He knows. A lot.
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
What's it so hot in here for?
You wanna drink?
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
Me. It's Eddie.
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
What's this supposed to mean?
What are you writing?
Yeah. For a little while.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Haven't you opened it?
I've got something in my bag.
Raw.
Don't you ever cook anything?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
What did all this stuff cost you?
I'm hungry.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
You got it all in your head?
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
Thanks.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
Oh, I forgot.
Where you been all day?
Well, what do you want to know? And why?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
Okay. So what's your name today?
You told me.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
Come here.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Give me a drag.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
No. I'll take you home.
Fifth of scotch?
I could always get us a bottle.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
Hey!
What do you do on the other days?
So why go to college?
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
You don't look like a college girl.
Yeah? What do you do now?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
No, not always.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
Around.
Then why go to the bus station?
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Can I buy you another drink?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Can I sit down?
Have a nice trip?
Have a nice trip.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Yours.
What time does the bus leave?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
How long have you been waiting?
How long you been waiting?
Long wait for a bus?
...you shoot a great game of pool.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
You name it.
I came to play pool, Fats.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Yeah. That's right, too.
That's right.
California. Oakland.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
