How much do I owe you?
Will you take a check, Bert?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Oh, about five hundred.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
Good, good.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
Yeah. You must come again.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
By all means.
You gentlemen care for a drink?
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
Would you like to come out tonight?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
Findley.
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
