So do you, Fast Eddie.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
Let's go.
Thousand dollars a game.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You watch me.
Game's over, Eddie.
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Very good shot.
That's what the game's all about.
Your shot.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Twelve. Cross side.
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!
Hundred dollars?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
I hear you've been looking for me.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Where do you come from?
Is that a fact?
Now and then. You know how it is.
