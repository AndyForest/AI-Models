Yeah, I'm quittin'.
You better not miss, friend.
Heads.
Okay, friend. You're on.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Okay.
Try me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
How much are you ahead?
You quittin' too?
Okay, friend.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Hi.
