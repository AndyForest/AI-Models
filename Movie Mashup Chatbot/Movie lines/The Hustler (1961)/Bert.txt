All I want's the money.
That's the way it's done.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
Are you ready for another?
You tell me.
I'll make it up to you.
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
Well, nobody has to sell.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
To win.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
I want to talk to you.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
That's right, Miss Packard.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
Twelve thousand.
Cash.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
It's possible.
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
Do you really think you can beat him?
How much?
Deal the cards.
You ever played billiards before?
We'll be there.
Could be.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Aaaahhhh!
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
I'm a businessman, kid.
You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
Well, here it's half.
Half.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
You want me to tell her for you?
It's a long walk.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I said we're leavin'.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
How're the hands?
All right. Five hundred.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
I don't know.
'Bout even.
You hustlin' me?
How much?
Well, we won't.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
So does Eddie.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Over there by the bar.
Hey, Findley's here.
Come on, let's go...
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
Thinking about what?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
What happened to you anyway?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Sign up.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Man named Turk Baker?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Hello, Eddie.
I don't know when it was.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
I never saw you do anything else.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
For me.
Seventy-five per cent.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
That's your problem.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
He drank as much whisky as you did.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Character.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
Pool.
Poker's not your game.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
Only when I work.
I'm buyin'.
Two.
Cut.
Sit down.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
