Thanks for all you've done for me.
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him...
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world!
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
Yes.
That's right, Modern Times.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Yes. I want proof.
Why? What do you mean?
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Come in, Alfredo.
Too bad!
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Will they really find work in Germany?
It tastes wonderful!
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!!
But don't you like anything about what you do?
No...
Then why don't you change jobs?
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going.
But you don't have any kids!!!
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Fifty lire...
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film.
So I can have these?
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation...
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
You're still beautiful...
Who?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
Elena!...But when...
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
I don't care. I'll wait.
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
We'll talk about that later.
Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh?
Hi, Elena!
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
You never used to do that!
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.
Somebody stole it.
No...
I don't remember him any moreï¿½Ma, where's Russia?
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
How long's it been shut?
OK...
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
