No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending.
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs...
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
My husband...you know him.
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
So what'd they say?
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
For what?
But...who...
Father, I have sinned...
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Hi. Why are you running?
Elena. My name's Elena.
