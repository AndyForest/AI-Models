And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
Then where's the money?
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
