You're not going to take your *suit* off!
Well--I--
Well! You don't say!
And how's your bill, Senator?
I'm splendid, too.
Splendid.
Goodnight, Senator--
Then you *did* say it.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
How are the pigeons?
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Wonderful!
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
Father--oh.
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
How nice.
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
