Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Now, pet--  Jim!
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Taylor, my dear.
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Sam Foley--dead!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away.
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Washington! Always discussing the problems of Washington. Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems!  I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high *time* I told him a thing or two!
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
Y-yes, Jim.
Me! Jim--how--?
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Oh--Jim!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Henry Hill.
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
Horace Mill--!
One minute! Just one minute!
Yes, Jim.
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
The--head?
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State.
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
Himself!
I did. What about it?
Oh, a *boy*!
Is *what* getting me down?
Emma!
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Than what?
What stuff?
Uh--could--could I help--?
A pet shop?
Why, of course.
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
I beg your pardon?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
