Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Thanks very much, sonny--
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Where's the Majority Leader?
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
It couldn't be.
Looks like it, but--
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
Never.
I did not--
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
Ma! Hold him!
Aw--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
Look! There it is!
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Washington!
I yield.
For one week!
For a question!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Mr. President!
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
Please, sir!--come with me!
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Mr. President--
Mr. President--
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Mr. President--
It does!
For a *question*.
Ah, now, that's better.
Yield *how*, sir?
Y-yes.
Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
Well--goodnight.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Well, I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Yes, I was--
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Thank you, sir.
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's.
We'd better see.
How's Amos, Ma?
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Sorry about this, Governor. But it won't take a minute. You were saying something in the other room, sir--
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
Yes, Ma?
Oh, now--
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
You're a liar!
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Where do we go from here?
Yay!
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Oh--Saunders--
But--I've done everything I--
Wait--
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
Saunders--
Are you drunk?
Saunders--!
Wow!
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Oh--*Saunders*!
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate!
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Already? All these letters?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Yeah. This land to be bought by contributions from the boys. You have that. Money to be--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
You--don't know it, do you?
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
I've got more. You better tell me.
Lena.
Letitia.
Abigail.
I know. It's--Violet.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
It hasn't been easy, has it?
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Have you always had to--work?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
You mean--here?
I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
Yes, yes--
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
I did--and--and I got right up.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
And a *lot* of paper!
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
We're over in the House.
*This* is.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
The Steering Committee.
What's that?
Calendar?
Some committee's got it.
Yes, I see that.
Why?
Why?
Committee, huh?
How?
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Tonight.
Oh, just a day--
And with your help--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Right.
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Punch?
I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Whose statue is that?
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Is--is something the matter?
J-Jefferson Smith.
The man downstairs said number--
Office of--Senator Smith?
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
That's what I said--the *truth*!
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
That's--that's splendid.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
No--I mean--yes--that is--
Oh--you are!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Sure.
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Yes, sir--
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
"So help me God."
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Well--I can *manage*--
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Well--I have got *one* idea--
Ax?
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
