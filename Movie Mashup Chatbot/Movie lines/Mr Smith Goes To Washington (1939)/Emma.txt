Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
No wonder--without your dinner.
Otis!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Nonsense.
We're waiting, Hubert.
Dinner, Hubert.
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Great saints!
What is it?
What is it?
That infernal phone!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
