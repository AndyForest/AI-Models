I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Certainly. Step right in.
Yes. Come in.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Just fine.
Certainly would, Joseph.
Fine--
Hello, Jefferson.
What?
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Jefferson--
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
