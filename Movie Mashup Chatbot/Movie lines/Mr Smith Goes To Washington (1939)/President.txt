If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
Ring the call to quorum.
Order, gentlemen!
That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Order!
Order!
Senator Paine will state it!
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Senator Paine.
