I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Excuse me.
Yes.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Yes?
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
How much is what?
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Yes?
