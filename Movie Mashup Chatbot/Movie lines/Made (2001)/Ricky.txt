See you later.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Where's the place to go tonight?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
What if I gave you forty?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Is it the good room?
So?
Yeah. Take it.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Is it a good room?
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
What's 'incidentals?'
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
So you're models?
I don't get it. What do you do?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
So, wait, you're from where?
No. I'll wait here.
Dude, we were practically made...
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Three and a half hours?
So what do we do?
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
It's gonna be fine.
I'm sorry...
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Calm down.
What about it?
You did?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
Eighty five.
Eighty.
No.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Float me a hundred bucks.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
Wanna bet?
All the more reason.
I'm pretty sure we do.
We need guns.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
The penguin house.
Let's check out the penguins.
I'm your soldier.
You want us strapped, don't you?
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
C'mon, man...
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
We're getting whacked.
Where?
What's up?
She was jonesing for me.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
Fine.
You got that right.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Back in.
Fuck this.
You too?
About what?
So we're working?
He woulda told us right?
So is this the drop?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
Yeah. What vibe?
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
You know this guy?
I mean, that's what I heard --
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
Don't even start.
This is bullshit, man.
So they said more than the address.
How'd they know who you were?
Nothing else.
They didn't say an address?
What exactly did they say?
Fuck...
Well, I don't want to walk.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
What are you doing?
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Yeah, I guess.
Forty-six.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
You sure?
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
I'll get the girl.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
To keep?
She really liked the kitchen.
Right here's fine.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Who's driving her?
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
What? Did she say something?
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
It's not even yours.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
What are we delivering?
Fuck him.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Sorry coach.
I'll beat your ass --
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
He implied it.
I think we might.
We need guns.
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
Fuck them.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
I'll page you with the number.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
How am I being shitty?
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
So, it's not a winning record.
So, it was a draw.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
What about it?
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
I didn't do anything --
You want to come splash around.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
You want your surprise?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
And you grew up in Manhattan?
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Cardiff Giant?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
Where do you live?
Where do you live?
Yes.
Drinks are free, right?
The videos.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Ugh...
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
I'm half Irish.
Ow, shit...
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
You really in trouble?
What? Why am I bad?
Why? What I say bad?
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
It means you got a gun?
You strapped?
How do you know it's not drugs?
Where's Spa.
I call 'em wiggers.
A lot of Persians?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
You know my pager number?
So you're our own private guy?
So whenever we want...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is it nice?
Ricky.
Yes, sir.
But, Max --
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
You want... Why are you picking on me?
Don't worry. I get it.
I get it.
Yes.
What about my keys?
Keys.
Yeah.
And where do we bring it?
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
We're going to New York?
Can I borrow a piece of --
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
Yeah.
So, we're talking money laundering...
The Red Dragon.
Who's gonna outfit us?
He has a cute what...?
No...
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
She poured it for --
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
It's a digestif.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
No. I'll take a strega.
I'll get it.
Dip?
A rose by any other name would --
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
And where might that be?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
