Good luck.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
