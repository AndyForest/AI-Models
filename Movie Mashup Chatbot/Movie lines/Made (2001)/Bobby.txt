Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
What are you talking about?
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
No thank you.
Yeah.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
No more.
Bullshit.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
What time is it there?
Mommy's not home?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Chloe?
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
What's wrong, baby?
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
She's, uh, sleeping.
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
What'd you say?
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
How could you let her see this?
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Max offered to stake me.
I'll support you.
I want you to quit.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Go.
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
No coke tonight.  Right?
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
I feel weird asking him.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
You talk to Max today?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
I'm ready.
Who's watching the baby?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Honey?
I don't get it.
Your dance is over.
Get your hands off of her.
I said no touching.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
There's no touching.
Where's Ricky.
That it?
How so?
Where's Ricky?
Where we going?
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Heard of them.
Ruiz tied in out there?
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Yeah?
No.
Where is this happening?
So what do we do?
Yeah.
What's that?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Shit.
When's it going down?
How bad is it?
So, when's the drop.
What's his name?
He making the drop?
Yeah. Where is he?
Get away from her.
She'll be out in a minute.
You driving her?
Yeah, sure.
5-5-1.
Draw.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
There won't be a next thing.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
You want --
Yes.
Yeah.
No. Okay. I'll think about it.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Yeah. Sure.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
He'll work it off.
You told him you liked him.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Ruiz knows about this?
Yeah.
Yeah. Sorry.
I know.
No.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
I don't understand.
Then what are you saying?
So, that's it. I'm out?
What?
I'll work it off.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
They were out of line --
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
That's why they call it the smart money.
She was fast, huh?
Pshhh...
This one?
Why?
Me? No. Not really.
Sure. Yeah.
Where's the drop?
What's the plan?
A bad heart.
Nah, man...
Good morning.
We get it. We're sorry.
What drill?
Taken care of?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Yeah.
Yeah?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
'Trustafarians?'
Yeah.
No. That's cool, man.
No. Just the cross streets.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Where is the Soho Grand?
Nah.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
What's that?
Bobby.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
It's important.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Can you check?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
We're with Ruiz.
I'll be a minute.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
Easy...
You're not getting a gun.
Where do you get this shit?
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Let's just go now and wait.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
No more, man.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
Eighty bucks?!?
What do you have left?
You're out of money?
Why?
It was six in the fucking morning.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
We don't need guns.
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
Did you hear what he just said?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
The what?
Let's do it.
Nothing, man.
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Put that shit out...
We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
What are you doing.
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
We're not getting whacked.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
He wants to see us now.
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
What the fuck was that about?
What the hell did you do?
Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English.
What the fuck's going on?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
You fucking nuts?
Where do you think you're going?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You happy?
Yeah.
You would think.
Like I said, I don't know.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
What did I 'get?'
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
I don't know.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
You got something to say --
What the fuck is that supposed --
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Motherfucker...
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
What the fuck do you...
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
They asked who it was.
Nothing.
I told you what they said.
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
What are you doing?
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
Oh really. Why's that?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Great. On my fucking room.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
How much was it?
How much is it?
C'mon, man...
Who you calling?
Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
No. Look. There.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Nah, don't bother --
What's the movie?
Pretty nice.
It's ours.
Is that the woman from..?
I don't know.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Seat belt.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Nice work.
I like it.
I like it.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
We look good this year.
Sorry coach.
You wanna go right now?
Bullshit...
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
He didn't say we need guns.
We don't need guns.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
Shhh...
Then why do you try to get in?
I thought you hate that club.
Bye.
I will.
I got no idea.
I know the number.
Yeah. I know the number.
I'll page you.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Don't be shitty.
Don't be shitty.
It's not losing record.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
So?
What are you saying?
What about boxing?
C'mon...
Bobby and Ricky.
Tom. How's it going?
