I want you to take her with you.
Take her.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Goodbye, Bobby.
I never promised you anything.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
With what?
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Ho's a good guy --
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Yeah? You sure?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Oh, please.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Oh my god. What happened?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Where were you?
