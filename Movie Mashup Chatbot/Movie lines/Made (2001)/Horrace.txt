Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
This is it.
That's it.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Ricky's taken care of.
Quick drop. In and out.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
He must have that shit troughed.
Brooklyn.
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
Excuse --
C'mon girl. Eat up.
Yeah.
What's up? Jess ready?
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
What's your record at?
Well, you look it. You win?
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Watch it...
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Stop.
See you later.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Don't drag my ass into this --
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
'Strapped?'
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
How's it going?
Here...
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
That shouldn't be a problem.
Coke?
What do you want?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
You want another drink?
No shit?
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Word.
Nah, man...
Good morning.
Yeah.
