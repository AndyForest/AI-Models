Fuck...
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Hey, boys.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Come, now. You just got here.
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Here they are, then.
No, really, mate?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
Does anyone want another?
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
No?
And where is...?
Who's up for a night on the town.
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
I am.
Scotland.
Edinburgh.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
