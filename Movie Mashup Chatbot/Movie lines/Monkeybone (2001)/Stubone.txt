Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piï¿½ata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
How much?
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
I need a new PR guy.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
Got a doctor on duty.
Ohhh, nothing.
<i></i> In what way?
Sure. Why?
Bitchin' good cake.
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
