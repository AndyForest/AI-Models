I don't <u>know</u>.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?

Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.

You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
