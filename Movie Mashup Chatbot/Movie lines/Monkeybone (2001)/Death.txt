Thank me next time you see me.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Well - you'd need a body.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
<u>Why</u>??
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
