I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Five CC's.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Switch hands.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Yeah...before your time.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
I don't know. I guess it was...
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
He called me "Doc."
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
You sure this is...medically advisable?
What are you watching?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
What's the matter?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
Stu?
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
I don't think so.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
What's the "bad" part?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
Who?
Can't you give it to me later?
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
Kimmy! What's the matter?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
The ring...
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
When'd you get in?
