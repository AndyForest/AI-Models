I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
You're really gonna pop the question?
And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
Less.
What's the matter?
A piï¿½ata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
...In some weird way I respect that.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
Why?
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
