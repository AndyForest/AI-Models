I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
I didn't say anything.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Stu Miley.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Uhh - martini?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Death! Thank you!
Back? You're sending me back?
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
DEATH!!
Bend over?
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piï¿½ata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Monkeybone...!?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
YOU SET ME UP!!
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Hyp, I'll do anything.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Tell me what?
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
How was it? I don't recall.
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
I'd better go report this...
Are you okay??
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
I might wake up.
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
How am I gonna get past the guards?
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
What?
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Where'd he go??
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
All right. You can come.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
<u>What</u> union?
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
I am not. And I don't gotta.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
