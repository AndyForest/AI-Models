I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
