Go. Just <u>go</u>.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
Don't ask where I got it.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Hypnos?
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
