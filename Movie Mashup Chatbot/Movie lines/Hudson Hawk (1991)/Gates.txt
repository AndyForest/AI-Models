So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
Remember that shoe you lost...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
