Wh-wh-whooo?
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Looking to score?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Let me see it.
Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  Leave your car and walk over here.
You got the cash?
Back here.  At the end of the block.
We just thought...
But --
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
