Is this Hell?
Anywhere but here.
We can climb out.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Damned if I know.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Spooked?
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
We gotta jump!
Here!
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Bill!  Bill?!
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
Cinn?
And you believe her?
The dead get out?
Lucky thing.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
What else does she say?
Why?
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
I manage them.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Daddy?
Dad?
Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
From what?
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Did you do it?
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
Post-toasted's more like it.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
You gotta use your imagination.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
Not that I remember.
Yeah, you heard of him?
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
But the place burned to the ground.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Evidence of what?
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
Ours!
Moe's terms.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
