In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Mother!  No.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Who?
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
All the more reason I should be here.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
And what's that?
Have you ever been inside?
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
You mean as opposed to your life?
I have to finish this for class.
I can't!
I can't find you.
Patrick, he's...
I'm here.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I can't.  Not yet.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
That place is already bad luck.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
How do you know?
Are they on the radio?
You moved into this block?
