Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
That's what?
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
You know I can't.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
How did you get in here?
You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
Sorry, my brother.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
Please...help me...
That's the past.  It's dead.
You were just a kid.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
What are we doing down here?
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
No way man...
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
I didn't sell it.
What building?
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
Don't call me that.
What the hell do you want?
