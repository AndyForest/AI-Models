Bones.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
I said, no thanks.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Those 'fools' are my people.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
What else?  Money.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
What it will be.
Hush, baby.
Where we'll always be...
I want you to do something for me, baby.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Then fuck it!!!
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
And the hell everybody else, right?
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
What it will be.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
We met.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
