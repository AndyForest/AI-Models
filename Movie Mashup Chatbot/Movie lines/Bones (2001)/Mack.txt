Go on.  It won't kill you.
Just try it.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
You got a nice crib here.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
You was just doing your job.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
You boys been hitting the pipe?
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
