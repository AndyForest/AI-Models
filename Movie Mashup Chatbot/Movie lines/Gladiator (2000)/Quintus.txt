You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
I was summoned.
I can't let you do that.
My troops don't make policy.
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
Serious stuff...
Well, we can try...
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
