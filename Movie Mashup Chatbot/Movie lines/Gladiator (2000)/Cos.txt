I'll nose around...
I don't know...
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
