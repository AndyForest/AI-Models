Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
I'm serious.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Until your confirmation date.
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
Caesar, ignore them.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
But have never been?
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
God of passages and changes?
