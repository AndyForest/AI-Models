The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Maybe he's not dead.
Dead?
But how can it change every time?
How do you do that?
What's the question mark?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
It's the game, ARCADE.
How'd you know it was us?
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Has anyone seen Greg?
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
Never been on a snowboard.
There never is.
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
We don't have a choice!
Screamer.
Look around...
Our time's up.
Check your read-out.
There...
Yeah, that's what worries me.
The clock's already ticking.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
You've got the schematics, check.
Got it.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
One.  In case...
You feel it?  It's different this time.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
What?
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
Yes I am...
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
Put in a quarter.
What are you looking for?
You didn't hear me?
Dante's Inferno.
You got the schematics?
I can't believe you made it!
What are you going to do?
No I'm not...
Virgin sacrifices?
I was afraid you'd say that.
And beat it at it's own game.
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
SLIP-STREAM.
Then where do we go?!
The Police, then...
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Like the fractals?
Nick, what is it.
What?
Where do we go?
We can't...
Change the channel!
Let's go around back.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Laurie's.
She thought Benz was at school.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
Sure.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
All of them?
Something's happened to them.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
It turned itself back on, Nick.
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
So how did it know my name, then?
It is.
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
Turn if off!
Can you turn off the game?
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
Funny.
I'm coming over.
No, in person.  Now.
I have to talk to you.
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
Nick...
Hello?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Yeah...
So where is he?
Well, it's a long story...
Go for it.
And then keep on driving?
I'm okay.
I know.
Oh God...oh god...
In this world, wrong is right!
Which way?
Then we'll go home.
Thought so.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
I'm thinking!
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
What did he do to you?
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
Yes...but...how did you...
But I don't understand...
Mom?  You're alive...
