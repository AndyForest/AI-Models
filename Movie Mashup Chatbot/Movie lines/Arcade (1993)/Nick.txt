Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
How the hell did you do that?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
What's the riddle?
How do you stop The Screamer?
What do you mean?
Does that thing work?
What is it?
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
Christ...no time...
I don't want to talk about it.
So that's what we almost died for?
We can't reach that!
What the fuck is that?!
What?!  There's nothing here!
Shit...
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
Right, then...
Okay.  It's West.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Don't even say it.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
We're actually inside, aren't we?
I know.  It sucks.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
You don't get it, do you?
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
You're not coming, Alex.
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
Alex...
Yeah.  The Inferno.
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
Everything.
Jesus Christ!
Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
You mean we learn the rules...
What?
I don't know.
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
It's already out.
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
That's what I thought.
My house.  I want to try something.
We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
Then leave her.
What?!
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Where to now?
Well?
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
No way.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
You imagined it.
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
Happy?
I'm in the middle of it...
What do you mean by "weird"?
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
It's twelve-thirty!
We are talking...
What the hell are you talking about?
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
Hey, kid.
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
Sign me up.
So how do I start?
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
"Escape"?
That's impossible.
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
