Talk to me.
Why don't we take this into my office.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
You don't like it?
Now what seems to be the problem?
Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
So what do you think?
The game will guide you.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
