So how did you do it, Alex?
Hold my keys, then.
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
