No.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
I want our boy back.
I don't know.
I don't know. Something's missing.
Lila?
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
No!
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
No. You look so beautiful.
God, you're beautiful.
Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
What?
Well, I think...
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
I've got some things to tell you.
Please. Just one minute of your time.
I just want to talk.
Hi. It's Nathan.
Urgh.
Unnhh.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
What is it?
My little French.
Very well.
Fine.
Gabby, what is it?
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
Yes. Happy happy.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
That would be good.
When you were a little French girl?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Of course not.
Not at all.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
You decide. Today is your day.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Lila...
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Yes.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Shit.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
Thank you very much for that.
I think he's ready.
Bravo to you, Puff!
I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.
Such as what womanly things?
How come?
Really?
Have you?
I guess.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
That's great.
Sure. Of course.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
I'm just preoccupied.
No.
Of course not.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Good. Making progress.
I'm glad you're female.  Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
I have to think! I have to think!
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Your entire body?
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
What are you doing in there?
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
It's perfect!
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
A deer?
What?
I love you so much.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
Flares?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
What SPF, sweetie?
Oh, and the sun block?
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Shaving cream?
Terrific. Can't wait!
That's a great idea.
Why certainly!
Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
I'm sorry about my parents.
What are you doing in there?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?
You do?
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
Yes, and...
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No biggie.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
My God! The fork! The fork!
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
As do I.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
No.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Puff, put the gun down.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
Even better.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Tomorrow, the acid test.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Lila?
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
No, why?
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
