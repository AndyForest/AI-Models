Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Okay. If you think it will help.
That's what I'm counting on.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
He's dead.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
You what?
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
Very well.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's okay, Puff.
I'll be in touch.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
Shut up, you.
Oh, Rosie.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
Ready!
Oh, Rosie.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
Your brother should have his license revoked.
How'd you know where I was?
Rose, please go away.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
And I think I'm going to.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Three foot one.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
One night stand?
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Really?
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Won't he be able to tell?
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
What do you mean?
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Shut up and tell me.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Always. Ow.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Ouch. Yeah?
Ooka.
Oook. Oook.
Ugnh.
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
So he's doing okay?
You were gone a long time.
Ummm. It's good.
Should I come with?
Absolutely!
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
Oh boy!
That was wonderful!
I had sold my fucking soul.
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
How's work?
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Really?
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Do you like my new look?
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
It would just be helpful to know.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
So, how's it going today?
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
You are an animal.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Who from work?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Nothing. Be right out.
All right.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
What?
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
He looks perfectly fine.
I think he's feral.
Come on.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
I don't know. Something.
Did you see that?
That's very funny.
Absolutely.
Yes.
Yes, darling.
Fifteen.
Of course.
Yes, darling.
I don't think so.  Why?
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Do you?
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
I'll be out in a minute.
Nathan!
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
I like you, too, Nathan.
You really enjoy my company?
You do?
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Boy, this is good!
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
I'm sorry?
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
It looks wonderful.
We are animals after all.
I'm not sure.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
What's the larger experiment?
Paper or cloth?
How's it going?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
You are a therapist, right?
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Where?
You've got to respect that.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
