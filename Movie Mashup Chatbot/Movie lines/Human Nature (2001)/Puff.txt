Oui.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Woof.
Like father, like son.
Gabrielle.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
Nice night.
I want to be the way I was before.
But I like being human now.
Very well.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Shan't happen again.
My apologies, madam.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Unn.
Ugnh.
Interesting.
here, here.
Thanks to you, Nate.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
Got it.
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Extra dessert?
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Yahoo!
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Okay. That's fair.
Oh boy!
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Yes.
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Mother?
Yes?
