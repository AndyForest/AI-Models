French?
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Say my name.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Hello, my little boy.
Okay.
Please let me go with you.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
We still have you and I.
Oui.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
That's Lila?
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
You were wonderful!
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
Hunh.
That's not how he tells it.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
I've moved on.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
Please. I look a mess.
Well?
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
What for?
Like what?
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Yeah? What?
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Stop. Get away.
Not in front of the boy.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Hmmmph.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
What is wrong, my darling?
Shh.
You are sweet.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
I am sleepy.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Shall we close up, then?
Oui.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Is everything fine?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Oui. Perfect!
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Oui.
Oui, doctor, oui.
