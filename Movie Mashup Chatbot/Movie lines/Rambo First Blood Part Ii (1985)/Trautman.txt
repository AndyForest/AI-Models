You pathetic scum.
That's an order.
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Not my people.
Take your time.
I know...
I know.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
Black.  No sugar.
You think they'll find any?
How long before you're fully on line?
Nice work.
How long have you been setting up?
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
What did you want?
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
You're not.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
This your stuff?
Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Mind if I sit down?
Hello, John.
