How much we got left in that minigun?
Forget it.
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
Can you handle the door gun?
You comin'?
Yes.
You better take off.
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
You never been in one of those things.
I'm getting him out.
That guy's not going to make it.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Roundeye.
Let me see.
American?
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
How you doing, Brewer?
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
Powerful warrior.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
We'll check it out.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Fermented fish sauce.
No cigarettes.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
There are no worse places.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
No.
Exactly.
There's a compass in the handle.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
What's this?
Batteries not included.
What do you call that?
You okay?
Home on my strobe.
You read me, Brewer?
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Show me how it operates.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
One hundred.
Ninety.
Start over.
You stopped.
Again.
No.
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
John.  My name is John.
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Look, Co...
How?
I couldn't get you in.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Invulnerable.
I do?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Let's go.
Thanks.
Why'd they want us?
Are you okay?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Where's his father?
Intelligence work.
How did you get started working for the spooks?
I thought he was with you.
Why's that?
How do we get upriver?
You really got a Masters Degree?
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
All this is for us?
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
We just take pictures?
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
What's the plan?
I'm not jumping blind.
Where?
Why me?
What's the job?
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
What's your name?
Can you walk?
American.  Come to get you out.
You got it, sir.
Let's do it.
I say we tape him to a chair.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Yeah.  Big time.
Those men are all dead.
That's it.  My life.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Am I out of here?
I could take it or leave it.
Colonel.
