... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
What just happened?
What's that?
You mean the snake?
No.
That's right, buddy.
Huh?
You're gonna love it.
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
Duck soup.
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
Gawd, you look awful.
What... whattaya do?
Are they going to torture us?
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
I suppose you have...
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Nothing we can do, man.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
Alright.  Home run.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
It's a guy in a cage.
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
I need a vacation.
Pirates?  No kidding?
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
Yeah.  Dinky-dau, that's me.  Hey, Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?
What's that?
What's she saying?
Yeah...
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
What's this stuff on the rice?
I had it cupped.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
Damn!  Leeches.
This place is a trip.
I've seen worse places.
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
Where's your stuff?
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
Read you.
Yeah.  Why not?
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
That's what I'm here for.
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
Gettin' old, huh?
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Ever do this from a jet?
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
