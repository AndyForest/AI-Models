Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Still no response, sir.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Aye, sir.
Nothing. As before.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Will we get another ship?
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
