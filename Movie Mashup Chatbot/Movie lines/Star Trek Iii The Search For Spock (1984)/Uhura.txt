Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Gentlemen. Good evening.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Would you look at that?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
No, sir, no response.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
All true.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
How is that...?
