Scotty...?
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
What did you see, Chekov?
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Response?
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Calm yourself, Bones.
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Mr. Chekov -- ?
David, I don't understand...
David!... What went wrong?
David... Sorry I'm late.
Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
How many more?
What's wrong?
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
Good shooting, Scotty.
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Mr. Scott?
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Mr. Scott...
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
My God...
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
What? What are you saying?
Goodbye, David.
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
What happened...?
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
Saavik... Is... David with you?
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
Yes, yes, Spock...
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
You would have done the same for me.
Yes. And I know you.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
Go, Sulu!
Come on!
What about surface life signs...?
With some on the planet...
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Fire, Mr. Scott!
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
See! That shimmering area.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
I'll need it, Sulu.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
She's to be decommissioned.
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
Will you be able to handle that...?
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
May I ask why...?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Indisposed, sir.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
Give me your hand and we both live.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
But, why?
You should take the Vulcan, too.
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
Wait! Give me a chance --
David?... David!
Who is this?! How dare you --
Torpedoes coming in -- !
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
What I have done, I had to do.
What about Spock?
What you ask is difficult.
What must I do?
Bones!...
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
... Spock...
... The needs of the few...
... Yes...
Yes...
Of course...!
Then, how --
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
But -- why?
Yes, I was...
I -- saw no future --
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
