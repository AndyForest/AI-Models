They outnumber us, my Lord --
How can you tell that?
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
Sir, may I suggest --
Success, my lord.
Understood, my lord.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
