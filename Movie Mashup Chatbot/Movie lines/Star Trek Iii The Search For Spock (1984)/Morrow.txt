Any time.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Yours...?!
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Welcome home, Jim.
