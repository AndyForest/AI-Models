But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Yes... But -- how...?
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
... Or the one.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
He asked you not to grieve...
... He spoke of your friendship.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
