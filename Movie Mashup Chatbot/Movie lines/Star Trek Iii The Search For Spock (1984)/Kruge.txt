Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Genesis, I want it.
Because you wish it.
No.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!

Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.

Report status!
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
They know we would die first.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
I ordered no interruptions.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
Station!
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Share this with no one.
So!  Speak!
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Put him on screen!  Study him well.

Wait!... Wait...

Steady. Continue on impulse power.
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
