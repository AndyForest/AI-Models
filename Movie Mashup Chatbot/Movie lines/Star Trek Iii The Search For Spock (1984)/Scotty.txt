Just him, sir!
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...

As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.

Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
