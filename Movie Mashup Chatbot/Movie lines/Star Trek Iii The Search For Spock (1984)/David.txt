Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
Not from here, no.
Why don't we beam it up?
I don't believe it...
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
I went wrong.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
Hello, sir. It's David.
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
I still don't...
I don't understand.
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
This planet is aging in surges.
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Not exactly.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
Later. Let's go...
What is it?
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
.          .. Spock's tube...
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
I'll handle that later.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Short range scan.
A photon tube...!
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Underground deposit?
It's a little early to celebrate.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
