I'll go...
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
... How long?
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Did your collaborator know?
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
Why?
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I have already made one transmission too many...
That may be difficult...
Logic indicates that is the case.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Spock's burial robe.
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
David --
My readings indicate great instability.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
... Or <u>who</u>.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
... Fascinating.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Captain, what's happening?!
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
None that I can detect, sir.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Do you have an explanation?
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Much is at stake...
. He will remain always as he is.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The Genesis planet is gone.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
