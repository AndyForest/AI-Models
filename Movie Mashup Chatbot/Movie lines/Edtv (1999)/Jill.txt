Yeah. Why?
Ed?
Good?
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Are you busy tomorrow night?
We have to stop meeting like this.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Hi.
That girl's an idiot.
