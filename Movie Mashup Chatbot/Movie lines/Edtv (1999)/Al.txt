Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
I'm moving out.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
You thought it was me?
Where is she? Is she all right?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
How's your mother?
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
They celebrated the common person.
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
What do you love her or something?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Anything good?
At what point?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Do they show it?
What if--you're vomiting?
