I don't think so.
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
Ed --
Ed --
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
Leave her be.
Ed, do you want my advice?
Great line.
Yeah.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
A woman wants to be pursued.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Uh-huh?
How you doing, Ed?
Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
Yes, Ed.
I do.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
I want you to take this.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Ed, can I see you a second.
What did you study?
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Good luck.
I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
Take him off the air.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
He's who we want to go with.
