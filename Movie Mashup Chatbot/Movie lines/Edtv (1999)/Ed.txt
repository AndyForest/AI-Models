Oh, Al ... This is just...
What?!
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
Went --
Yes!
Al!!
Al!
No.
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
Yeah, so... ?
Who?
Come on...
Yeah. Ma...
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
What if I'm vomiting?
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
What if Shari's the dream?
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
Yeah?!
They tore her dress! ...
Sure.
Yeah?
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
No, uh...
Um, yeah -- thanks.
Cool.
Excuse me.
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Al!
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Really? They were..
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Mm...  Oh, man...
Thank you. Can I see her?
Yes?
So he killed himself.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
What?
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Tell me.
You said that.
What?
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Ma...
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
But Al is your husband now!
Why? How...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
The doctor said you were having sex.
So you had sex with him?
Who?
What happened?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
Oh God. What hospital?
What's the matter?!
Mom?
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
Who?
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
He says --
Holy sh--
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
I mean, that worked out.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
How's Marcia? She all right?
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
No! And that girl has a name.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Hey, he cheated on her.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Yeah?
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
What are you talking about?
Well, when will she be back?
What is she, at work?
Hi. Is Shari here?
Shari, Ray feels --
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
Right, yeah --
What's going on over there?
All right. Let them decide.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
I can't?
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
Our what?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
How much less?
He's just ... trying a little too hard --
What does this mean?
Are you asking me?
Hey, Lou.
Who's in it?
Well, then I'm quitting.
You batted or you bunted?
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
It's nice.
What did you do to your hair?
Kinda'.
Come on.
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
It's not their fault.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
I need to talk.
Come on...
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Somewhere.
Come on, let's go.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
So?
Really?
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other...
Ohh...
No. Who?
Shari...
So...?
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
Shari, I really like you...
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
What?
He could give me some oxygen.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Saturday, I think we should
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
I missed you.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
Really?
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Can't we just --
Well, when you put it that way.
It's... okay
Yeah.
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
Oh... how come?
Okay ...
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
You do though, you look great.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Dynamite.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
I hear the dog really liked him.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Me?! That's you!
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break."
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
Me?!
Ray, come an--
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Look, we gotta talk.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
... Ray?
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
You brought the girl!
Why me?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
We'd better go...
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
You watching the ballgame?
It's me, Ed.
Great.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
What's the dif --
Oh, Jesus.
Ray --
Marcia's living with a singer?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
No. What happened?
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
Polish acrobat.
Yeah.
All right.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
I don't know.
Screw off.
I'm doing all right.
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Why do you do that?
You would do this? You would actually --
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
We're excited.
Thumbsucker!
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
You're in show business?
What is?!
What are you drunk?
What?
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
Where were you?
No -- keep it.
No problema.  You want a picture?
Who's --
Hi, Shari.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
The pirate ship.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Oh, man! So...
What...
The whole time? Eighteen years?
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
It's Ed.
No. Am I supposed to?
Hi.
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Ohhh...
Mm.
Mm.
What is? Oh, dinner!
Can I help with anything?
Sure.
No.
Hm?
Oh!!
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Thanks... That's ...
Hi.
What?... Why?
