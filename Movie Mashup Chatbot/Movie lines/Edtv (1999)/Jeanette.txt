I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Ed! How did you know I was here?
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Oh my god! On TV!
To you? In front of him?  With the...
What?
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
It was horrible. He called me up.
St. Joseph's.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
I'm at the hospital.
Eddie...
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
And what did he come back now for?
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
What's the difference?
She had white shoes.
She could've been a nurse.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
He had girlfriends!
Both.
Yes.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
Oh my God!!
Oh my God!
Mm.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
He made a mistake.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
No. It's a mess.
No.
Send him away.
Are the TV people with you?
Eddie? ...
