I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
Who's Shari?

Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
