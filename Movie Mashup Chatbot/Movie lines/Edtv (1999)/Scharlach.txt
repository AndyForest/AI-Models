Where are you going?
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
This guy.
