So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
What do we have to do?
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
This is going right up your ass.
Everybody's someone.
What?
The what?
No... Could you?
No. It's your fault.
...yeah?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Are you all right?
Okay.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Where?
I'm sorry.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
Ed?
There's a list.
Twenty-nine.
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!

Look at this.
Everybody hates me!
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
... yeah, then, but...
I really like you too...
I know, I ...
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Um...
Why?
That's lucky.
Oh yeah.
The what?
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Yeah, well...
What are you doing?
Oh God, this is so weird.
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Really?
Go!
Leave. Go.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Oh my God.
Really?
I mean bad.
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Ha!
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
What do you want?!
Right.
Dynamite is dangerous.
So?
Cream rinse?
Why do it?
Are you sure about this?
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Yeah...
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
By the X.
Sign here, please.
