And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
You know what your problem is?
Come on, Ma.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
Good-bye, brother!
Cassie...
Save it.
I know.
Yeah.
Please!
You brought the cameras here!
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
Yeah...
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Hi.
Who is it?
While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
Yeah?!
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
What?
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
What?
I got your message. Way to go!
I'm making a tape.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Yeah. I service video equipment.
Show business.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
What's up?
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
That's the point -- this could change things.
We don't have foibles.
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
