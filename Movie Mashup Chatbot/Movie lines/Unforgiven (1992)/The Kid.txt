You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
You could have it. All of it.
You... gonna take... the money?
Sure. Sure, Bill.
Wha... what f-for?
I trust you, Bill.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
First one I ever killed.
That was... the first one.
Say, Bill...
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
I can't see 'em.
Yeah.
Is it him?
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Tell me right off if you see him.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
You still think he's in there?
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
When we gonna double back?
They takin' water?
He ain't killed.
You missed him? You didn't...?
What happened, did you hit him?
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
Did you kill him?
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
You don't recollect!
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
You're goin' back with him?
No.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala.
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Oh.
Huh?
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
Well, how about it?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
I could of... easy.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Hell, yeah.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
That ain't what I mean.
Well, suppose he does?
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
That was your idea, I wanted to...
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
His pistol must of jammed.
Jesus.  You done this before?
Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Say, Ned... ?
I ain't blind, you asshole.
Fuck you.
More.
Far enough.
Yeah?
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
You gonna share your half with him?
Nothin's bent.
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
Thought you was followin' me.
