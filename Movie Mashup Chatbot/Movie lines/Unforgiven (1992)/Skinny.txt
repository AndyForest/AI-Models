Thank God.
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
You told them cowboys you had it.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
You could run off them two cowboys.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Yup.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
What's all that wood?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Hit your finger, huh?
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
