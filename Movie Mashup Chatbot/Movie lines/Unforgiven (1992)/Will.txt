N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
K-k-kill somebody?

All that money... I mean... did you...?
Did you... did you... ?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
That fella come by... Tom.
Three.
Hullo, paw.
Who's he?
Two more hogs got the fever.
