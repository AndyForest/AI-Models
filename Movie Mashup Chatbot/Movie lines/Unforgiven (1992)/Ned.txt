I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
You want the Spencer, Bill?
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
Two.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Easy, Bill, easy.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
Easy, Bill.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
He's dead, Bill.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
Jesus.
How far kin you see?
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
You're marking us, Bill.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
He hit you?
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
You ain't like that no more.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
You ain't like that no more.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Well, she...
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Sally?
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
He musta been movin' right along.
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Three ways?
This Kid, what's he like?
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Yeah?
Just like that?
An' if I spot 'em?
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
We'll bury him.
Maybe.
We done that stuff.
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
I don't kill nobody without him.
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Plenty of times.
How many you killed, Kid?
I don't like the question.
Yeah.
He's blind, for Chri...
See that scrub oak yonder?
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
I'm a damn good shot.  See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
