He said...
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
I didn't think they'd really do it.
She back in Kansas?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Your wife?
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
You want... a free one.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Are you really going to kill them?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Three days. Are you hungry?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
You ain't dead.
