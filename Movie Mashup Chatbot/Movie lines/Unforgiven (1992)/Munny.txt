Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah. See?
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
Oh. Yeah.
Free ones?
Advances?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
That big guy lookin' for me?
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
Three days? I must be.
Oh. How long I been here?
Scouting?
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
I thought... you was an angel.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
Like I said, I...
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Then... what?
What'd Ned say?
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
A sign on him?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Who killed him?
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
You better get on back, Miss.
Lemmee see it.
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
We all got it comin', Kid.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
Take a drink, Kid.
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
Yeah?
First one what?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
Just SHOOT!
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
Did... you... get... him?
Yup.
You can shoot him.
Yup.
He's in there.
Yeah, he's in there.
It's gonna get riper yet.
Shut up, Kid.
After a ways.
Yeah.
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
I got him.
Better re-load it.
Shit!
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
He got the boy's horse.
Finish him, Ned.
Get some sleep, Kid.
Well... I don't recollect.
What business?
Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Lookin' at?
Huh?
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
Three ways, I figured.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
Been gone near three years now.
She's passed on, Kid.
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Jesus!
What for?
About what?
Oh.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
He said that, huh?
Maybe I ain't.
Yeah, I guess so.
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
William Munny, yeah.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
Yeah?
Huh?
Yeah.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
You sure you ain't armed?
You ain't shot.
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Worms was comin' out.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
I seen him.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Yeah?
No.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
Yeah... you said that last night.
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Shit.
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
HEY, KID.
HEY.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
Beats the hell out of me.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
Yeah.
Sometimes... yeah.  I don't miss it all that much.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
She gave me the evil eye.
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Two weeks, I guess.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Eleven.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Who said that?
What?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Did I what?
Well, I come back, didn't I?
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
The Kid, yeah...
Tom?
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Best we move that pig.
What is it, son?
