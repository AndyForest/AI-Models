I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
You could've handwritten it.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
'Sorry about the late notice...
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
...Worse?
What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
'Have a look?
You look a little tired.
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
You've been coming in early.
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Did you?
Had you talked to him much lately?
I heard what happened.
It scales, don't you think?
The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
What're you implying.
Right... Right.
Milo. What's up?
You're making me young again.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
How's it going?
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
'Think I should buy some originals?
Okay. I'm Gary.
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Just do it.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Wait... He knows.
Let's go.
Okay, #2.
Just do what I'm asking!
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
What'd the girl say?
Maybe we should all get on it.
This is good. Who did it?
