Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
I can paint anywhere.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
"Make" him?
You are a fanatic.
Is it over?
You're just afraid to eat it.
It's gonna get cold.
Here we go.
Oh, right. Hold on.
Milo?
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Just shut up?
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Milo, you --
Milo --
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
What?
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
That was -- different.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
Guilt?
I remember.
...Why?
Nothing?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
...Whaddo I do?
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
You can't just walk in, either.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Milo. Why would he --
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
They hack into people's programs?
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
It was a hate crime.
Teddy was killed last night.
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
He's your boss. He's not your --
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Milo! What about --?
We're not gonna let it.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Didn't you visit the campus?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
It's important.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
I don't think he knows how.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clichï¿½ about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Prick.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
No.
