Latitude 47 degrees.
What?
Maybe it's the satellite.
But you said the other --
It's three years old, it --
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Please don't go.
Why?!
Does he know you know?
You'll come up with something.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Gary.
What'd he say?
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
You mean -- break in?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
A what?
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
How close are you?
Time?
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
What about "60 Minutes."
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Who can we trust?
What about the FBI?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
...Milo?
He's out of prison?
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
Oh yeah?
But why would they --?
The Day Care?
Why would you do a thing like --
That's great. I -- didn't know.
Then and now.  But not right now.
Long story. Not that interesting.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Did you wanna be alone?
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
...Something like that. Yeah.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
You're famous around here.
You know my name.
