I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
Where we going?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
What're we looking for?
Every entry was authorized.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
