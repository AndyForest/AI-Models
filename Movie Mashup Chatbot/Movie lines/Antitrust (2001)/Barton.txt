And Outpost? You're happy there?
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
My goodness.
Milo?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
Have a seat.
Milo?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Like I said: shot in the dark.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
