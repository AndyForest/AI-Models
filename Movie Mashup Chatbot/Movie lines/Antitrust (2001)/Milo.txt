Right. Wait. A toast.
...wanna savor this.
Great.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
...What?
You look beautiful.
Great!
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Look at this.
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
...Different?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
Remember Lyle Barton?
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
Nothing.
So you believe me?
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
I can't just walk away!
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
You think I don't know that?
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
What're you -- what?
What!
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Isn't that -- extreme?
I know, I know.
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
That took some fun out of --
When's Brian coming for the TV?
You saved my life in alot of ways.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
...But?
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
Yes sir.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
I am. I am, sir.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Right... What's that mean again?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Is it your dish?
Gimme the coordinates?
Wanna be a part of history?
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
What'd they ever do for you?
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
You're living here?
Who's that?
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Oh hi.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Gary, I --
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
That's great! Thanks.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
Sure.
I'm okay. It's going well!
Gary, hi.
The wrong place?
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
Oh. Yeah.
Talk about work? Never!
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Definitely.
I'm sure.
Nothing!
You really wrote this just today?
Well -- you sent for me.
You did this -- overnight?
It's okay. Really.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
...Do I?
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
I do!
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
Skywire.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Oh. No thanks.
Cool!
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
...Hello?
Cool.
Got out of my other commitment.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Those really weird, short lines.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Just thought his work should go on.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
You do?
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
Wait a second. He knows I know.
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
...He knows.
Let's try #2.
Bring it to the other location.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Meet me at the other location.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
That's lame, isn't it?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Oh.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Thank God.
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
I told Teddy about you.
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
Why were you snooping in my office?
Why were you so careless?
I don't know --
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
What?
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
Certainly not at my happy home.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
Do we post it on the Net?
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
No, no. Never.
Hmm?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
They'd frame him.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
I snuck into #21.
She saved my life.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
Why's that?
You're compulsive.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
No. Please.
Cool!
Show me.
What've you got there?
Did I say something?
Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
...Were you?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
You know mine.
Lisa.
I didn't plan this.
What does that mean?
What d'you mean?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
I don't know.
I met this girl.
Jesus, Teddy.
What?!
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
Is that how Larry feels?
...You got my E-mail?
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
What're they building?
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
She's a programmer?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
