Oh...
Jesus...Jesus!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Who is it?
So you met somebody else?
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
You've been with someone!
Oh, yes, you have!
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
What are you going to use for money?!
Why?
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Like what?
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
I don't sell my work by the yard!
They're in the basement.
...or films you must see or...
Elliot lusts after you.
Yeah.
Because he likes you.
Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Hmm?
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Absolutely.
No, nothing.
No, thank you.
