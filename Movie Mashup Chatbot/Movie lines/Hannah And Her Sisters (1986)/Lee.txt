Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Uh-huh.
Yeah?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Hi, Dusty.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
No.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Oh, all the time.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I know it isn't.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
I didn't sleep all night.
I almost didn't.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
I can't say anything!
Poor Hannah.
But not over me?
Why?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Not because of me, I hope.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
What do you expect me to say?
Why, you know the situation.
Oh, don't say those words!
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
I was looking for you.
Elliot!
What are you doing?!
Elliot!  Don't!
Did you ever read this one--?
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Yeah.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Bye.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Well, thanks a lot.
Well, sure.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
No, I don't think so.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
I'm...all right.
Everything's okay?
Yes?
No?
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
No, I don't have time.
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, you would.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Oh, God.
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Yes, I do.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Ohhhh!
You're out looking here?
Oh, what, in this section of town?
What are you doing here?
Oh, Elliot!
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
I don't know exactly.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
Yeah.
I'm saying it now!
I'm sorry.
Stop accusing me!
No.
No.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Because I have to!
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
I can't take this anymore.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
What's the problem?
Oh, Frederick!
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Me?
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Mm-hm.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
Mmm...
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
Are you sure?
How about something to eat?
Want some coffee or tea?
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
I think we need to eat.
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
She's going through a really rough time right now.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Like what?
Oh...
Really?
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
How are you?
No.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Why?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.
I bumped into your...
Come on.
Oh, great.
Okay.
I think they're fantastic.
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Hmm.
April?
Hi.
Oh...
Where are the antihistamines?
Yeah.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
