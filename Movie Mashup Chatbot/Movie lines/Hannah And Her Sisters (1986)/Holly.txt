Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
But I'm seeing him.
And you, you-you're going?
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
You're joking.
What?
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
Uh...
It depends on what way you want to go.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's really terrible.
That's disgusting!
Yeah.
Right.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Oh!
Wow, it's the red one?
We're a big hit.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
I know.  It's terrible!
Oh, okay.
Yes.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Fast.
Yeah.
And it ruins everything else.
Yeah.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Uh-huh.
It's terrific!
Yeah.
Oh, what, what do you do?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
What makes you think we're more interesting?
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
We're actresses.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Well--
Oh, so loosely.
My script?
Hey, what's the matter?
Good.
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Hmm!
You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
You treat me like a loser.
Yeah, you mean not at my age.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
Yeah, that's clerical.
Well-well, like what?
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money.
You got it.
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
So what's new?
Well, I just came from an audition...
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it.
Yeah.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Easily.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
You know.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Yeah, can you believe it?
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Sometimes she's terrific...
He's married...
Oh, yeah.
Well, how about this?
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Ouch!
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's such a loser!
Oh, Hannah!
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
Frederick didn't come with her.
I should get a garter belt.
She really does, though.
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
Okay.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Two thousand dollars.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
No, no, we decided!
I'm pregnant.
Mickey?
Tch.
Thanks.
Just a few minutes ago.
Okay.
Hi.
Yeah.
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
It's all right.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Oh, wow!
Oh, God!
Oh!
Right.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Really?
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Oh, well.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Oh, I'm fine.
You're okay, though, huh?
Oh.  Oh.
You're kidding me.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
No, I haven't.
No, the reason I ask is--
Really?
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Come on.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Yeah.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Probably not.
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
I'm okay.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
People change...you know.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
I'd never do that.
Yeah, it was.
Yeah?
Oh, no.
I'm fine.
How are you?
We didn't hit it off.
Yeah.
I recall you.
I remember you.
God!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
At least I'm open to new concepts!
I was so bored!
Thanks for a swell time.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
No!
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
You want some?
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Why are you so upset?
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
...which I did not get.
Dad!
Dad...
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
God.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
