Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.

Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
