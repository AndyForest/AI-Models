I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
How do you know?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
So?
Why should I be afraid?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
How can we be happy?
