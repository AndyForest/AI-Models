Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's very beautiful.  Big, weird...you know.  If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
How ya doin', man?
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
Well, are...are they big?
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Hi.
