I can't believe it!
Mmm?
Oh, listen...
Come in, come in.
Mm-mm!
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
You matter to me.  Completely.
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!
Are you?
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Are you in love with someone else?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Are you angry with me?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
I want one with you.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Why not?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Are you in a bad mood?
It's so late.
Where're you going?
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Mmm.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
I know.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
She has all the cooking talent.
I know!  I know!
Aren't they great?
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Oh, Mom!
It's on the table, Dad.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Hi.  How's she doing?
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
I am... I did slave all day.
Get his wine away.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Yeah?
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Oh, now--
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Y-yeah.
I'm okay.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Do you miss Frederick?
So how are you?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Oh, yeah?
Doesn't she look pretty?
You look so beautiful.
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
You've outdone yourself.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
I want to experience childbirth.
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Well, what about artificial insemination?
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
This is the second opinion.
Is there no chance?
Wow!
Football!
Oh!
That's a beauty!
Thanks, thanks.
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
That's really nice!
I know, I know.
Ohh!
Yeah.
I think so.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
He's fine.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Huh?
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Very good.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Hi!  Hi!
True.
Now, Holly's not shy.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
Okay, okay.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
...from Mavis, also.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
You're grateful, but you resent me.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
You're too demanding.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
How?
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Oh, God...
Oh, gosh.
Oh, what do they know?
Boy--
Awwww...
Hey, hi!
Look, everything's going your way.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
I hope.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Uh-huh.
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
I know, no--  I know.
Ohh!
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Really?
Singing?
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Oh?
Oooo.
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Oh!
Here.  Be careful with those.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
He's not a loser at all!
It's, uh, you never know--
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Don't you think she does?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Ohh?
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Will you just tell me one thing?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Oh, sure.
Perfect!
What?  You're kidding!
