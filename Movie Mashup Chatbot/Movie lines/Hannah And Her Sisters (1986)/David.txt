And then, uh, April...huh?
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Yeah.
Look at this.
Well, let's do it.
You want to see some?
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
Are you really interested?
Hi.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
We could...we could do that.
Well...
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
It does.
It's really sad.
They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
Yes.
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Yeah.
What time do you get off?
I'm an architect.
I cry at the opera.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
You're Holly.
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Oh no.  Not at all.
Is this your first job?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
I can't resist.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
