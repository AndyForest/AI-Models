I love that.  That's my type.
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Oh, good...
...any sister talk?
Great.
Yeah.
Uh --
A lot of works.
That's just --
Great.
Oh, yeah.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Oh--
Yeah.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Oh.
Well, let's hope so.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crï¿½pes caviar.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.

Uh...
Well, I live downtown.
Oh, geez, yeah.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
It feels like you're in France.
It's French, though.  It really is.
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
Oh, is that what it is?
Oh, it's magnificent!
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Mmm.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
