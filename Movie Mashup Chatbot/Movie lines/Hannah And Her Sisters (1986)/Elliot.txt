Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
Lee...
And you're in love overnight?
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
But it hasn't been forever.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Is something wrong?
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
Oh, my God.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
This is not an easy situation.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
Lee... uh...
I thought you weren't coming.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
I have been in love with you for so long.
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Oh!
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Oh, right.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one.
Oh, I would love to hear it.
Oh, you-you have that one?
He's got like six gold records.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh, that's nice.
But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
How's everything?
Bye.
Page a hundred and twelve.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
How-how's Frederick?
Yeah.  How are you?
Yes.
Uh, yes!
No!  No...
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Yes?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Where are you headed?
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
How about you?
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Hi.
Oh, my goodness!
Yeah.
Like, uh...?
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Oh, great.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
You're not lost.
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
Leave me alone, can you?!
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
No.
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
I didn't say that.
No!
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
But, you got four children!
I don't know.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Was I?
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
You bet.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
That's where your talent lies.
Great idea.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
They're fantastic.
Mm-hm?
