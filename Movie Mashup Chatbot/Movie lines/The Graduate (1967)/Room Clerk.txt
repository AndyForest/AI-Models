Whatever you say, sir.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Of course.
Sir?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Where is your luggage?
Where is it?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Is anything wrong, sir?
Will you sign the register, please?
A single room or a double room?
Yes sir?
It's in the main ballroom.
The Singleman party, sir?
Can I help you, sir!
