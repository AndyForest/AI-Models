Get out!
I am going to call the police now.
I want you out of here.
Because I don't like you.
You heard me. Out of here.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
What did you do to her?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Who screamed?
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
One of those outside agitators.
You're not one of those agitators?
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
What are you then?
What's that?
You a student?
