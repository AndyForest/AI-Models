I don't think so.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Go home now.
Then you'd better start believing me.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Do exactly what I say.
Drive down the block.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Promise me, Benjamin.
Then give me your word you won't.
Thank you.
May I stay then?
You don't have to say that.
But if it's sickening for you --
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
If that's how you feel --
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
Of course I wouldn't.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Did I say that?
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
What?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Are you?
I see.
You're not.
I wouldn't know.
Yes.
Benjamin?
Let's drop it.
No.
I have my reasons.
Good.
Good.
Do you understand that?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
There's nothing to tell.
Because I don't want you to.
No.
Don't talk about Elaine.
That's enough.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Oh my God.
What?
I don't think we were the first.
We'd go to his car.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
How do you think.
Kind of.
Art.
Why are you asking me all this?
Yes.
Yes.
Not particularly.
What?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Are you shocked?
Don't tell Elaine.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
See if you can guess.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
No.
Is it?
I don't.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Not exactly.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Is it?
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
No.
About five years.
No we don't.
We don't.
Thank you.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Calm down, Benjamin.
What?
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
He's asleep.
I walk out.
There isn't any.
Him?
What?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
I don't remember.
What?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
Do you want to hear it or not?
I got up.
Do you really want me to?
Can I take off my clothes now?
I don't.
No.
Neither.
Go ahead then.
Don't you?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
How about art.
Well?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Are you tired of it?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
If you want.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
That you're afraid --
On your first time --
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
You can admit that, can't you?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Are you afraid of me?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
You what?
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Thank you.
Either one will be fine.
What?
A hanger.
Will you bring me a hanger?
Why don't you watch?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Benjamin.
Thank you.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
The number.
Yes.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Benjamin.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
That's fine.
Why don't you get it.
Yes.
Do you want to get it now?
Do you want me to get it?
Do you want to?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Did you get us a room?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Waiter!
May I have a drink?
How are you?
May I sit down?
Hello, Benjamin.
Thank you for taking me home.
Benjamin?
Yes, I do.
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Do you understand what I said?
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
I want to say something first.
Don't be nervous.
On that chair in the hall.
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Why is it?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Don't you think he trusts us together?
What if he did?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Then why do you keep running away?
What are you so scared of?
Thank you.
Come on.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Won't you unzip my dress?
I think I'll go to bed.
Will you unzip my dress?
Benjamin?
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Yes.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Sit down.
It's all right.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
So?
Well I don't know.
Like what?
What?
What's wrong?
Pardon?
My husband will be back quite late.
No.
Sit down, Benjamin.
Did you know that?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
What do you think of me?
I'm very neurotic.
Yes.
Drink?
I don't know.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
What do you drink?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Please.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Will you come in, please?
Thank you.
No.
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
Will you take me home?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
In general.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Is it a girl?
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Is there an ashtray in here?
How are you, Benjamin?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
Yes, I can.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Yes?
Yes?
Hello.
