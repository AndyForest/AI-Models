Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Say that again.
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?

Are you ready in there, feature attraction?

Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
They are?  Come on.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
