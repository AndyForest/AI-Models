When did you two talk this over?
Well -- when did you decide all this?
They don't know?
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Goodnight.
No.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
But I don't want you to make up something.
Not if you don't want to.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
What else?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
I don't believe it.
What's happening?
They came all the way from Tarzana.
The Carlsons' are here.
Is anything wrong?
