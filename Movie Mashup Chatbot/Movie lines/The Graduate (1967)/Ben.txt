What?
The day after tomorrow?
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Where did he do it?
Oh no. He said that.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Why do you have to see him?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Carl who?
Carl who?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Why wouldn't it?
Why wouldn't it?
We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
You really will?
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
We just can.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
You mean you're confused?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
When?
Is that so? You might marry me?
But you might.
You won't?
What?
But Elaine --
I don't understand.
No.
I don't know.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
My belt.
If you want.
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
Then what?
Because it isn't true.
You've got to tell me what she said.
What did she say?
Did you say rape her?
What?
Elaine -- I love you.
All right then! Yes!
What do you think?
Because -- I am.
Come in.
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Here he comes.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Here? In Berkeley?
Oh.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Is that him over there?
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Where are you meeting this person?
Ah. Where?
Don't cry.
No -- don't cry --
Elaine --
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
That woman. The older woman.
That woman --
Why aren't you ready?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
You do?
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
You sure you really want to?
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Yes.
No.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Yes.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
Do you?
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Of course not.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Wait a minute.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
But could you try?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
I just want to tell you something.
But, Elaine --
I'm sorry I took you in there.
Could you do it?
No -- why should I?
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No.
Do you want some dinner?
Yes.
No.
No.
Yes.
Hello.
Thank you.
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Hello -- who is this?
Yes, I will.
Exactly how do you mean?
Yes I am.
Yes, sir.
Mr. McQuire.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Could I make one phone call first?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
What for?
Mr. McCleery?
No, sir.
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Oh -- no sir.
What?
Ahhh.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Not exactly.
What?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Right.
I'd rather not.
I'm putting it here by the door.
I'm putting it on the top step.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Well I'll hand it to you.
Well here's the purse.
Mrs. Robinson?
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Yes.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Oh no.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
What?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
What? No. Nothing.
A single. Just for myself, please.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Ahh -- thank you.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
What?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
I'll find her.
What the hell have you done?
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
What have you done to her?
Where is Elaine?
I just don't believe you would do that.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
I don't believe you.
How?
Mrs. Robinson --
Now it seems to me --
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
This is absurd.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
But it's not.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
What are you doing?
You wouldn't.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Of course you did.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Don't start acting hurt.
Now don't start this.
You're goddamn right I am.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Well, I'm not.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Then let's hear them.
But why shouldn't I?
I was just kidding around.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
I wish you'd tell me.
Why not?
Don't talk about Elaine?
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Really. I want to know.
Do you remember the make of the car?
What kind of car was it?
Oh no. In the car you did it?
I'm curious.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
Well how did it happen?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Art?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
What was your major?
At college.
And you were a student also.
Was he a law student at the time?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Well I can't.
Why did you do that?
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
What?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Well how do you feel about him, then?
But you don't hate him.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Man, is this interesting.
How many times a year.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Well how long has this been going on.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Right.
Now let's keep going here.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
We're talking.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Always?
What do you say to him?
You walk right out the door.
How do you get out of the house?
There's no risk?
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
There!
What novel did you read.
What one.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
Yes I do.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
You're not interested in art?
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Oh.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
Oh my God.
Anything. Anything at all.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
INADEQUATE!
Wait a minute.
Who said it was my first time?
Wait a minute!
Are you kidding?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Is this -- what?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
This is all terribly wrong.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You're welcome.
Okay.
Wood or wire? They have both.
Oh -- yes. Wood?
What?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Yes?
Well.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
What?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
To tell you?
Yes?
Well -- goodbye then --
Yes -- I think that would be good.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
I got a single room.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Well -- I don't know.
Now?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
I haven't. No.
What?
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
He didn't see me.
A drink? Of course.
Very well. Thank you.
Of course.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Yes.
I've got to go.
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Let me out!
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ!
Get away from that door.
Where is it?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
What?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
But they would! Don't you see?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Yes, I have --
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Right.
I know that. But I'm --
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Yes?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Very much.
No.
Her portrait?
What is wrong with me?
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Aren't you?
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
What do you think?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Oh my God.
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Look -- I think I should be going --
What?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What do you mean?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
No.
When is he coming back?
Why not?
All right then.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
But it's light in there now.
What for?
What?
Right.
Let's go.
You don't?
What?
What?
That's right.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
Is what a girl?
No.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
It's down the hall.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
I say I've got it.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
No -- actually I'm not --
We haven't.
About an hour ago.
No -- they don't.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
I do.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
You don't?
You believe me, don't you?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
I do.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Well, wait.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
No wait. Wait.
Why did you say that?
Meet someone?
Oh, no.
Nothing else.
I drive around.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
When I go off?
What?
Sure.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
No. She doesn't know about it.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
That has nothing to do with it --
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
You got me.
No.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Different.
I don't know. I want it to be --
I guess -- about my future.
Well --
I'm just --
HUH?
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
You miss the point.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
But why?
No, I don't.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
I am not threatening you.
Now look -- please --
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
No, it's not --
Mr. Robinson?
Yes.
Hello.
I will.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
I will.
Oh yes.
Oh no.
I'd like to hear it.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Quite a while.
What?
I know.
Sir?
Thank you.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Thank you very much, sir.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
I've got to go.
Oh no.
Yes, sir.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
