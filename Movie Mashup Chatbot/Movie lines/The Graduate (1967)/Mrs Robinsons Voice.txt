I'll be there in an hour.
Give me an hour.
Did you get a room?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Benjamin?
Hello.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Will you bring it in to me?
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Could you bring it up?
I'm in the bathroom.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
BENJAMIN?
