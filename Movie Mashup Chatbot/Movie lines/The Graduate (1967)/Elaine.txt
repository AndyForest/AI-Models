Benjamin?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
No.
Shhhh.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
No, Benjamin.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Yes.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
I just don't think it would...
I just don't think it would work.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Tomorrow?
Yes.
I'll think about it.
I have to go back now.
I don't see how we can.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I don't know.
Yes.
I might.
I don't know.
Will you kiss me!
Benjamin?
Goodbye.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Well -- where are you going?
Are you going home?
What are you going to do now?
Oh.
The marble?
Don't you have it on?
What are you looking for?
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Don't tell me --
Please let me go.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
I don't feel well.
Why?
Let me go.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
I don't understand --
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Well, I want you to leave.
I said I think it is.
I think it is.
Is it because I'm here?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I want to ask you a question.
What?
-- really incredible --
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
But you're not enrolled.
Yes.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
No.
I've never been to it.
At the Zoo.
I'm meeting someone.
Get out of here.
GET OUT!
Oh my God --
You mean the one who --
What?
What is it?
Because I want to know what's happening.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
What's the matter?
Benjamin -- I really do.
I do.
Yes.
Okay.
All right.
I'm glad.
And it's all over now.
Did they ever find out?
With a family?
Was she married or something?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Yes.
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Benjamin --
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
What is the matter?
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Where we going?
All right.
Is anything wrong?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Yes, I do.
No.
No, I couldn't.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
What?
I want to go home.
Where is the car?
I think I'd better go home now please.
Will you take me home now?
No.
I don't know.
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Why not?
Aren't you eating?
I'd love some.
Do you always drive like this?
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you know what you're going to do?
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Hello.
