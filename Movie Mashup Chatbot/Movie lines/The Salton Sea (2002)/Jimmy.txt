Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Yeah.
What?
Bobby?
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
And you want me to do you some big favor?
You don't trust me?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
No one ever noticed?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
But...I've seen you.
What?
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
Hey, check it out...
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
Okay
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
What's this?
Thanks for not laughing at me.
Danny?
Was he the president?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Can I ask you something?
You want a hit?
No  You think she's a tweaker?
He doesn't have one.
I think on account of his nose.
Palmdale
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
You wanna score some go-fast?
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
10%.  That's ...
Sure.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Fuuuuuck
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
So, why'd you want to see me?
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
I'm hurting.
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
Finland is a country.
My features. They're Finnish.
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Nice day
I know a guy.
Twelve
Guess it's our turn.
I thought you were done.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
What is that? Rum and coke?
What is it, drugs?
