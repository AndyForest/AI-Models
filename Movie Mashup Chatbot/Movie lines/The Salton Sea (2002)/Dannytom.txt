I was talking to my wife.
You mind?
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
No.
That's it?
My sentiments exactly.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
What do you mean?
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
There's no motels around here.
Really?
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
Again, I thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
