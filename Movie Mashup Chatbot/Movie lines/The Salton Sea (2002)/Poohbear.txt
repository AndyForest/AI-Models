Cool it. We got business.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Just some buddies.
I'll keep that in mind.
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Yeah.
Now get talkin'
Shoot him.
Uh-uh-uh ...
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Big Bill
Big Bill.
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Pull your pants down.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
If you say so.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
Anything for a dear friend.
Hey, okay.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Make me an offer.
Secret recipe.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Crank or glass?
No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
