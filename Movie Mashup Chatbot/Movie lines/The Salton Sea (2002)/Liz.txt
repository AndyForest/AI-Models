Why are you doing this?
That is so unfair.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Just admit you're wrong.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Look at that place. It's creepy.

Tom, quit fucking around.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
And you've got wiener breath.
I was talking about Miles.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
