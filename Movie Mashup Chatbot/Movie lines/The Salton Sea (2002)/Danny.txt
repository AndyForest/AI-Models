Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
No, Why?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
nan
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
I'll see you tonight.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Everything go?
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Now that's down-right insulting.
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
It's downright classy is what it is.
Who wouldn't?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
Colette, go.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
I can't tell you.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I just can't. Okay?
Ass first into the world.
You always been this stubborn?
Find a new job.
You can still work.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
I'm kind of busy.
Who is it?
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Therapy session is over.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
How much time do you have?
How much time do you have?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
It gets me through the day.
What do you want from me, Colette?
: What are you up to?
I try.
It's the only way to play.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
How far out of town?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Oh. Hi.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Why don't you call the cops?
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
You get off on abuse or something?
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Why not?
Then leave.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Nothing.
Colette ...
This man sounds like a real catch.
Ouch.
Leave me out of this.
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
Oh shit
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
How?
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
It's Tom.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Good for you Jimmy.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
I don't trust anybody.
I can't tell you.
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
When? When did you ever see me use?
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
What the hell is that?
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
Why?
Wait till I tell you what it is.
You aren't coming with me.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
Yes, Jimmy.
Yes, Jimmy
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Sure, Jimmy.
No. I'm good.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
You're going to have to explain that one.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
Not tonight.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Can you set that up?
Can your man handle that?
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Don't get carried away.
What?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
That's a good one.
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
Sorry.
You on a roll?
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
You don't say.
Why's that?
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Lead the way.
Where to?
Midnight?
What time is it?
How the hell did we get this detail?
You don't understand.
What does that mean?
You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
Yeah, dickhead.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
What the hell is this?
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
Okay! Okay!
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
What?!
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Come on, guys ...
I'm sorry?
You want to do this some other time?
Hey, I don't play that.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Why do you say that?
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
But I just met you.
You're serious?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Can we talk price?
Not bad.
No, I'm good.
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Answer the fucking question!
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
My name is Tom.
Yeah.
Jesus.
Murder.  Beautiful.
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
Who is it?
What? Is it bad?
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Bubba.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
I was trying to score some dope.
What the hell are you doing here?
When?
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
Tell me what?
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
You don't find that repugnant?
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Thanks for not judging me.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
You think I'm a Judas?
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
I've got a hot one.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Excuse me?
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
That would be me.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
He's the only one I told.
Jimmy?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
What?!
And what does this have to do with me?
To who?
Yeah.  What about him?
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
It speaks!
