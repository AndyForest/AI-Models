I don't want to leave you.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Why?
I don't want to.
What is it?
Really, I don't want to.
They would have killed you too.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
What's wrong, Danny?
Why not?
I been that way ever since.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
He knows where I work.
I need my paycheck.
We been through that.
Please open the door, Danny.
It's me.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
What are you hiding, Danny?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
What is wrong with you?
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
This has nothing to do with him.
You really need to lighten up.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
Nothing.
Is that how you play?
And you admire that?
Like you?
Never heard of him.
Trust me. We're safe.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
What happened to your eye?
How?
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Because he'll kill me.
Fuck you.
I can't leave.
You don't understand.
I can't.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
It's not that easy.
Go ahead.
What?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
That bad, huh?
What about the guy on the very bottom?
How?
Oh God.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
I understand. Thanks anyway.
