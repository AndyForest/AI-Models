Nervous?
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
When is the deal going down?
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
You mean the menacing red car?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
You're lucky, Flynne.
They have. But they never found a lab.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
What's that smell?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
What's on the other end of this thing?
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
We know what's going on.
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
He knows somebody ratted him.
The Mexicali Boys
Turns out he's connected.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
What's he holding?
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
This the guy?
Maybe he isn't showing.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
Don't we always take good care of you?
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
