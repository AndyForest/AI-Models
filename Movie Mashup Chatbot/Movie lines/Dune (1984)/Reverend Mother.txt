Yes, my Lord.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
We felt his presence.
You mustn't speak of...
Stop him, Jessica!
They tried and died.
... Many men have tried.
What can be done has been done.
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
They tried and died....  Jessica!
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
You feel the flesh crisping?
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Pain.
