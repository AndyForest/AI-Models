Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
Yes, Sire.
Sire!
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."

If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
Not sorry enough.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
