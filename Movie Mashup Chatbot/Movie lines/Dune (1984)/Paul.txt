The Emperor's blade.
Let him stand free!
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Things have been so serious here lately.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Is this what you seek?
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
I'm sorry Gurney.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
Yes...
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Run!
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
Remove her gag!
Don't touch my mother...
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Liet?
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
Why do they come?
Always?
Will we see a worm?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
No.
He's hiding something.
Are you a Fremen?
Long live the fighters!
We surprised a band of smugglers.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
SILENCE!
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
Did they try and fail?
MOTHER! Tell me!
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
Did they try and fail?
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
Where?
What is it?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
THE PAIN!
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
It burns.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
The Voice again.
What's in the box?
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
I'd know the difference.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
