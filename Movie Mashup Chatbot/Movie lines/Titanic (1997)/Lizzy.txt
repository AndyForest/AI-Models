Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
What?
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
Don't you mean work me?
I'm sorry.

What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
That's enough.
April 14, 1912.
