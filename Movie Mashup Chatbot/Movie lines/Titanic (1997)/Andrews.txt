An hour, two at most.
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Good luck to you, Rose.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Hurry, Rose.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
The ship will sink.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Thank you, Rose.
