Rush her.
Holy shit.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Who's the best? Say it.
I'm tryin' boss.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
