I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
We're too late.
I make my own luck.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
She knows.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
You're precious to me, Rose.
What do I tell your mother?
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
Not the better half.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
You wanted to see the propellers?
An accident?!
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
You're a good liar.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
This should be amusing.
Good. Settled then.
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
