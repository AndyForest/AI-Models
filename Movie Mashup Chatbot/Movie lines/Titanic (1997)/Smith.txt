How much time?
The pumps --
That's right.
Excuse me.
We've struck ice.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
No, but we're making excellent time.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
