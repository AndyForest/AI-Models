Almost as good as you.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
Can I bum a cigarette?
Sure. Count me in.
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
How you two doin'?
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
Never let go.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
Right.
Get in the boat, Rose.
We'll find out.
I'll wait here.
You have to go for help.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
This is horseshit.
Right.
Now it's worse.
It's bad.
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
This is crazy.
It's okay. I'm alright.
Are you nervous?
Where to, Miss?
Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
He does landscapes.
What is it? A sapphire?
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
Sssshh. Come here.
You're right. Only you can do that.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Just move with me. Don't think.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Sure. If you like.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
I see you.
No, no! Just with her hands.
She had beautiful hands.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Just some sketches.
Well, I guess I will tonight.
It is that simple.
So don't marry him.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
Is he your boyfriend?
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
You're welcome. Rose.
Well, here you are.
Jack.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
So, you got a name by the way?
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
Hello again.
I've got you. I won't let go.
I'm Jack Dawson.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
No you won't.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
