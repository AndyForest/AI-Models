Under the Manhattan Bridge.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Ruptured steam pipe.
We must abandon.
Very bad today.
You are going where?
Big mess every time.
I opened thousands of brains.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Where you're going, mister?
