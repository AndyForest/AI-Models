Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Elliot?
Guys ready to order?
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
He goes to the theater armed.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Never mind.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
No one's waiting.
Home.
He's a very sweet man.
Do you think he can do it?
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Is what true?
The fact is, I have to get going.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
I hear good things about the new play.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Alla puttanesca.
What?
A little drastic maybe?
Engaging.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
A little.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
I think I remember.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
I'm going home to my machine.
I don't want you, Steven.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
I haven't come to you.
