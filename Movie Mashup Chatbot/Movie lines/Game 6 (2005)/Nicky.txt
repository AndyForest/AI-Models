That's where I peed.
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Do not inhale.
We must abandon.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Crosstown.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
What did you find?
Very big.
I used to drive a taxi.
Had to be him.
What do you mean?
How do you Eknow.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
Shoot him.
What?
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
He'll hate it.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
We're making too much of this.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
He carries a gun.
Don't wait Efor me.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Here we go.
Do not inhale.
I say we go.
Do we care?
What was it like?
A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
That's awful.
And he was there?
What happened eighteen months ago?
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
It's just a review.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
Tonight. What's tonight?
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
We must abandon.
Very dangerous.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
It's over, finished and done with.
She wants a divorce.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Shut up, Elliot.
I don't want to hear about it.
You're not making sense. Make sense.
Of course I saw it.
Yes. What are you implying?
What are you talking about?
Classic.
Great game.
They'll lose because they're my team.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
We don't even like each other, do we?
In and out of bed.
This is how we've managed to last.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
The Red Sox
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
About what?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
Can he get through it?
Our Peter?
I talked to her two days ago.
She's dying.
You know about Adele.
I hear Alan's sick.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
Everything.
I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Opening night?
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
That's completely crazy.
Why do you need a radio?
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
Do you want to get some coffee?
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
I am really, deeply sorry.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
Alma Wetzel.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
And you've been extremely patient.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
Opening night, Lillian.
Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
I'll have whatever she's having.
How prominent?
All right. What's been going on?
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
Two-all after six.
Life is real.
This could be it!
A thousand things.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
One more out.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
I don't know if I can say that.
Life is good.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
What do you want me to do?
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
I know, Pop.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
Where's your elastic brace?
Let's not start that again.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
We must have been heroic.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
It's me. Nicky.
Right here. At the door.
Pop, will you let me in?
I'm at the door.
This could be it!
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Because life is good.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
I don't know.
Life is good.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
I want to believe.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
It's a complicated subject.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
What am I doing?
Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
Now that's a complicated subject.
It's the kid's lucky day.
A grandmother. God bless you.
How come you got the kid with you?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
Oh yeah?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
What about my play?
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
Why do you care?
Why does it matter?
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Postpone. We have every right.
'm not worried about this kid.
hat was this morning.
appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
You're not making sense.
Eleventh inning. What else?
Have to hurry back.
When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
I hate the Mets.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
Why?
What do you mean?
This could be it.
And the Father replies?
Yes.
Yes.
Mine was cobalt blue.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Yes, Peter.
Yes.
Yes.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Sidney remains optimistic.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
Yes.
What? Come on, Paisley.
Yes.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
Someone waiting for you?
Where are you going now?
I don't know.
But you're his friend.
He wears a disguise.
Is it true?
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Would you like to meet him?
So do I. Over and over.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
One more time.
You know what.
Say it again.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
Endearing.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Oh. You know him.
So does Elliot.
There was a review.
You've worked with Elliot?
What's good?
