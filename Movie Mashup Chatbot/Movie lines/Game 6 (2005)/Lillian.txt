I'm glad we're having this talk.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
It violates so many trusts.
She's my gynecologist.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
Joanne Bourne.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
That's very lovely actually.
I'd forgotten that.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
That's always been my problem.
Who the hell cares?
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
Your father said you might be here.
