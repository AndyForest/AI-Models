Daddy, wait.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
What will we talk about?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
I'm not sure.
I have a class. I'm late.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
She is kicking you out.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Is it?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
See, Daddy.
What else?
See, Daddy.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
Yes.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What do we want?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Yes.
A flat-out hit.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Brilliantly moving.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
I'm willing to tell you my name.
Why won't you tell me your name?
