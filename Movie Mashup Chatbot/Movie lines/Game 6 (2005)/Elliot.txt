Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
Say it again.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
She was very evasive.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Paisley Porter.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
It's your best play, Nicky.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
No, we're not.
That was a big mistake.
Where is it?
Then you should carry a gun.
What about the haircut?
Where are you going?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
I'm not ready.
You say we go?
I think we Nought to wait.
Is it safe?
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
What do I exude?
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Do not inhale.
Asbestos lining.
Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
But didn't we know it would happen?
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
Don't talk like that.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
Press a button and they give us money.
Quietly effective.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
