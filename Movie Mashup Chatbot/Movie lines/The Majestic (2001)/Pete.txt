Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
I see you got the telegram.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Okay.  What's the second thing?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Damn...
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
I wish you were coming with me.
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
You'll stand by me?
What about you, Delly?
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Thanks, I like it.  I think.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
Hi.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
I'm not refuting anything.
No, sir.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Yes it does.
Yes... yes, I do.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Yes.
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Sir, that is true.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
I... I need a drink of water.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
A statement?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
I do.
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
The Bijou?
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
No.  But...
Yes.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Sandra Sinclair.
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Zackly.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
We live in a theater?
Wish I could say the same thing.
She's very pretty.
Call me... Ishmael?
I... no, I... I just can't...
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Thanks.
I guess I did.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
No, sir.
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
What do you mean?
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Not any more.
Luke didn't smoke.
No thanks.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
It's wrong, Leo.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
So, it is a blacklist.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Yeah, well, that's enough.
Why not?
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Exactly.
I was decorated.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
Who the hell is this "they?"
I... I don't believe this.
I thought you...
My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
It's about me.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
The customers?  I don't know...
Please, sit.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Will you help me, Sandy?
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
What exactly did you hear?
You bet, honey.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Yes.  Very.
The war...
They all know you?
I suppose.  Thanks.
Ancestors?
No.  Absolutely not.
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
I already have.
