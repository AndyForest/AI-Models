And  I love you, Pete!
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Did you bring along something to read?
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
You've got everything?
Whatever happens.
I am, too.
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
I believe you.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
Hi.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
You mean,  me?
... including me.  Right?
Dad...
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
I think  it's worse  now.
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Dad?
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
I see...
What... do you remember?
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Your dancing's very good.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Oh.  Okay.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Exactly.  And he got good.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
When did you start smoking?
Well, there's got to be a way...
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Nine hundred...
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
I'm  fine.  Really.
Nothing.
Yes.  Hic!
Yeah...
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
And why not?
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
Through the door.  It comes apart.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
You first.
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
You look... different.
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Do you... remember me?
