Delly, shhhhhh...
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Guess I must've learned.
Thanks.
That's... pretty frightening.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
No kidding.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
My what?
They're not bad.
Oh.
I don't smoke?
Have you got a cigarette?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Oh.
What?
Oh...
Were we going to get married?
Do you have the...
What was that?
We were in love... weren't we?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
I'm sorry.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
What did... what did I want to be?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
Whoa.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
How'd they get it inside?
Why me?
City hall?
Well... where can we go?
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
I did?  Huh!
I do?
Me too.
What.
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
A super market.  Huh.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Thanks.
Good to meet you.  Again.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
A few.
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Did I what?
I'm here.
I know, I know... keep still.
Jesus...
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
... what?
Dad, I...
Yes.
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
Well...
You bet.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
... Ernie.
But I...
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Who... are they?
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Didn't you have any help?
Why?
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Ah.
Can't wait.
Nine and-a-half years...
When did I leave?
Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
And... what's my name again?
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Can we get him to the hospital?
Aren't you coming?
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
What's wrong?
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
What?
No, I...
I can play the piano?
That was beautiful.
When was that?
Oh.
Yeah... me too.
Of course.
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
Is there a young Tim?
