Pete...
Then I'll call you a cab.
I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
The G-man?
What.
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
