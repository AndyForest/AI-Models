I had it, a minute ago...
Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
It's possible.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
Well...
That always used to work.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
How'd it go?
Delly?  In here.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Mother o'god...
Are you saying that he's...
By all means.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
That's where you live.
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
What is it?
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
Here, one of mine.
Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
Any idea how you got here, son?
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
You kids off to the dance?
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Evening, Luke.
