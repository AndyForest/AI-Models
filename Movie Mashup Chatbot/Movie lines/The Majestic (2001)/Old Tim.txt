That's my r-r-rent.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Cat.
Found me.
No.
I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
Oh...
Oh.
Oh.
They will.  They w-w-will.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
Thanks.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
