Mr. Appleton, you will...
Go ahead, son.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
