Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
Here we are.
Ben, when's Delly due back?
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
Shhhhhh.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right?
No wallet, huh?
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
What's that?
But what?
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
