Where're you going?
...Dad?
Good day, sir.
My patience is at an end.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Jerome Lundegaard?
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Know who this is?
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Okay.
No, no, fax is -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Dad's here.
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
...Chief Gunderson?
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
Whose car?
We've got a -
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Still missing. We're looking.
- looking.
Yah.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Yah.
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
No.
His wife?
What'd he say?
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
...Hello?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Margie Olmstead?
Yah, is this Marge?
