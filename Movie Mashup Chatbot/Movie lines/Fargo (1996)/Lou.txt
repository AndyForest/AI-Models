Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Yah, that's a good one.
...Geez.
Oh...
Yah?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah...
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
No way.
Yah.
How's it look, Marge?
Oh, yah?
Yah?
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah?
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Yah.
Yah.
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
