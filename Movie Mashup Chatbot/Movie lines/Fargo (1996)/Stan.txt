Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
Yah.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
What's the next step here, Jerry?
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
You're sayin' - what're you sayin'?
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
I'm tellin' ya.
We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em. So they call the shots.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
He's at Norstar.
Congratulations, Jerry.
