Okay, real good, then.
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
Yah, okay, but, uh -
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
...The heck d'ya mean?
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
Oh, geez.
What the heck d'ya mean?
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
My wife! What the - how's -
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Yah.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Okay.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Well, okay, it's -
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Huh?
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here?  You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super -
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
Yah!
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
Yah, right -
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
Yah.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
...Yah, okay...
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Ma'am, I answered your question.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Yah, I see.

Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
