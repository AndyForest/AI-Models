Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
