Ya got that right.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Just a general way.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
Yah, right-o.
Yah.
How ya doin'?
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
I'll fix ya some eggs.
Gotta go?
