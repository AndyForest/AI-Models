Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Where'd you get him that parka?
Oh, he's adorable.
Oh, now he's adorable.
You have children?
Oh, yah, I know that!
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
End a April.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh... A what?
Mm.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Oh, yah?
And what about the other fella?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Can you be any more specific?
In what way?
Where you girls from?
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
Yah?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Sir? Right now?
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
... I'm sorry, sir?
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Yah, but -
but do you know that for sure without -
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Mr. Lundegaard?
Oh, yah?
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Yah.
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Uh-huh.
You look in his citation book?
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
...Well, that passed.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Where is everybody?
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Hiya, Lou.
Aw, Norm.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Yah.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
It's okay, Mike...
It's okay...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Better times.
I'm sorry, Mike.
No, I didn't...
I'm sorry.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Well, they're a good outfit.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
No, no, that's fine.
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
...This is a nice place.
Just a Diet Coke.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Yah - how are you doon?
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah, that's me.
Yah.
No, that's okay.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya?
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Anyone else residing there?
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
There's the car! There's the car!
Copy.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Sorry - didn't copy.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Gustafson's accountant.
And this guy is...
The day of our homicides.
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
Oh. Geez.
Oh. Oh, my.
So... they didn't...
Linda Cooksey?
Linda.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Norm?
...Mike Yanagita!
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Yah?
Hello?
I love you, Norm.
That's terrific.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
It's terrific!
Norm, that's terrific!
Your mallard?
...So?
They announced it?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
No, no.
Oh, fine.
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Yah.
Prowler needs a jump.
Hon?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Oh, my.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
And his wife?
Uh-huh.
