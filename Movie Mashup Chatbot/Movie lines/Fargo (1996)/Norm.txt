I love you, Margie.
Yah, I guess.
Yah.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
It's just the three cent.
Yah.
Three-cent stamp.
Yah.
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
Was it reasonable?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Not on your feet too much?
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
Yah, ya think?
They're real good.
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Uh-huh.
Thanks, hon.
Yah?
Love ya, Margie.
