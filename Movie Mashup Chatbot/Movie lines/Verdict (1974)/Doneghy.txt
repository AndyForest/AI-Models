I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
What is this going to cost?
We just ...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
... that's all right.
