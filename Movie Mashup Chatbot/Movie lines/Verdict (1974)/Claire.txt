Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
What does it mean?
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
It looks that way.
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
Mickey told me to come back to work.
