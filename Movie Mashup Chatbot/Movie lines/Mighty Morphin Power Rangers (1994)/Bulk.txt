SKULL!!
There goes the neighborhood.
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
Here you go!  No pushing!

The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
