Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
... I just pray we're not too late.
... We must try to communicate with them.
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
