He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
What?
Right, right, sorry.
Where did you get that?
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
Have you any money?
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
-- Fezzik, please --
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
How many could you handle?
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
It's you.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Probably he means no harm.
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
No.
Where's Fezzik?
Now?
Now?
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
Why? You can't even lift one.
There we cannot help you.
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
Your guess is as good as mine --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- offer me money --
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Thank you for everything.
Humiliations galore!
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
What's that?
He's dead. He can't talk.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
Sixty-five.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Sir. Sir.
He's already dead.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Kill me quickly.
Okay.
I must know.
Who are you?!
Tell me.
I ought to be after twenty years.
I am not left-handed.
Because I know something you don't know.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
You are wonderful!
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
Begin!
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
You are ready, then?
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
We'll wait until you're ready.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
Sorry.
Slow going?
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
I want to duel him left-handed.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
You're sure nobody's following us?
Making sure nobody's following us.
