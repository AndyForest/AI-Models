You don't believe me?
So it's to be torture.
Then why bother curing me?
Then I'm here till I die?
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
Did you say, "I do"?
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
It never happened.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
Gently!!
Gently.
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
Singed a bit, were you?
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
There will never be a need.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Can you move at all?
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Of course you will.
As you wish.
As you wish.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
No.  To the pain.
DEATH FIRST!!
It will not happen!
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
In that case --
I thought he was with you.
Light him.
Not yet.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
And our assets?
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
