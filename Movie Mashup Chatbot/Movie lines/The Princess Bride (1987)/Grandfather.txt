As you wish...
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
I don't understand.
You want me to read this or not?
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
Do you want me to go on with this?
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Because I can stop now if you want.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
-- wait, just wait --
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Open it up.
I brought you a special present.
