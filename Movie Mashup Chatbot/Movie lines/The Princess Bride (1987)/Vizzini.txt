Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
I'm waiting!
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Faster!
Veer left. Left. Left!
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Oh, have it your way.
You know what a hurry we're in.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
Inconceivable!
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Go in, get after her!
What?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
That would be inconceivable.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
I will. And I choose --
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Hmm.
I smell nothing.
I accept.
For the Princess?
Morons.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
