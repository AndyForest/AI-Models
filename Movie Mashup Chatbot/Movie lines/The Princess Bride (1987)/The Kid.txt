Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Okay.
I don't mind so much.
What? What?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Who gets Humperdinck?
Westley's only faking, right?
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Yes.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
Oh no. No, please.
No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Well, I wasn't nervous.
What?
-- murdered by pirates is good --
I don't be-leeve this.
-- well, when does it get good?
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
-hold it, hold it-
Yeah. It's really good.
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Has it got any sports in it?
A book?
What is it?
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
What?
A little bit.
