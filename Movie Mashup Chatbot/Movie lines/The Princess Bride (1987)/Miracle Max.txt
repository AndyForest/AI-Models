Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated

You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
