Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
I do not marry tonight.
Should I be?
Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
He will come for me.
My Westley will always come for me.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
And what am I?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
You mock my pain!
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
He knows I do not love him.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
Who are you?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
What?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
We did it.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
What? -- go on --
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
We'll never survive.
I will never doubt again.
Well ... you were dead.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
But how can you be sure?
But what if something happens to you?
I fear I'll never see you again.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
