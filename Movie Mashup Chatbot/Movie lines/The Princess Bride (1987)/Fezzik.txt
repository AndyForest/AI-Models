Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
You're quick.
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
I could kill you now.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
What do I do?
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
I thought I was going faster.
I only dog paddle.
Anybody want a peanut?
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Who's Guilder?
I'll be right back.
I hope we win...
Inigo.
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Will this do?
Over the Albino, I think.
You've been mostly dead all day.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
I have a little.
The body?
Everybody ... MOVE!!
The Man in Black?
But you don't know where he is.
-- where?
-- what? --
I don't think more than ten.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
Yeah?
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
True!
Hello.
If there are, we'll all be dead.
Yes, some of the time.
He's really very short on charm.
