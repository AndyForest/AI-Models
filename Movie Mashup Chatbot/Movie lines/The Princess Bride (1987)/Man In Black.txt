... as ... you ... wish...
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.
Does it bother you to hear?
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
With pride. What can I do for you?
Rest, Highness.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
Catch your breath.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
Why should that make such a difference?
Why is that, do you think?
And a good thing too.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
Get used to disappointment.
No one of consequence.
I am not left-handed either.
There's something I ought to tell you.
You're amazing!
And what is that?
Then why are you smiling?
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
How old were you?
Do you always begin conversations this way?
Again. Thank you.
Nothing comes to mind.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
Thank you.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
You guessed wrong.
What's so funny?
Then make your choice.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
You're just stalling now.
Australia.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
You've made your decision then7
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
Good. Then pour the wine.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Yes.
You're that smart?
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
Let me explain-
