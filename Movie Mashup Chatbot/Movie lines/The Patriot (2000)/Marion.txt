Congratulations.
When?
No.
No.
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
The hell I do.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
No, he takes after his mother...
Pride will do.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
I expect to try.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Of course, I do.
I know that.
Excuse me?
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
How did this... how did I let this happen?
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
You look well, Charlotte.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
Prisoner exchange.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
I consider them linked.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
That one is a bit more difficult.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Very well, proceed, sir.
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Shall we proceed?
Colonel will do.
Apology accepted.
My pleasure, sir.
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
Yes.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
That's right.
And what do they know?
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
You know what happened.
She is.  Don't go in there.
Don't go in there.
Where?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Granted.  Where are you going?
What?
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
You learned her lessons better than I.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
No...
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
Pride is his weakness.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
These four wagons must be his.
Flanking riders?
God help us all when you're forty.
How old are you?
Is it?
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
Did your father teach you humility?
Is that so?
Oh?
It's safer if we stay together.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
It's already over.
You're in no condition to ride.
Not yet.  What happened?
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
And the Governor?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
What news?
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
The middle colonies?
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
Your son, what did you name him?
I hope so.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Goodbye, Harry.
It is ended.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Don't touch him.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Long time.
When?
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
What are my orders?
Who's in command?
Where is he now?
We saw.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
Thank you.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Gabriel.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
You were an Englishman then...
Thirteen years...
Harry, Harry, Harry...
It's Mister Marion.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Thank you.
Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
Don't worry.
Four, five miles.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
How many came back?
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
For what?
Reverend.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Worse.
Remember Braddock?
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Gray.
Put them away.
Put those away.
God willing.
Seventeen.
Not yet, Thomas.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Quiet.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
