Their names, ranks and posts?
What officers?
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Sir?
Very well, let us move on to...
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
That is a separate issue.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Thank you.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Oh?
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
As you wish.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
How can we end this madness?
And if I triumph, you triumph.
If I fail, you fail.
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
