Thank you.
Late summer.
Good.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You call that a compliment?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
