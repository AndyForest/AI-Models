So you're hot on this stock?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
