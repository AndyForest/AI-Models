No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
