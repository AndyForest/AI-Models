We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
