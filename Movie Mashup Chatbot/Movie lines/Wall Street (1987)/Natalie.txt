...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
What are you doing here?
