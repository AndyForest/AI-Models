I don't know anything!
You sure?
What if they call him?
What if he asks where I got the money?
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
