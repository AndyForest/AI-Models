I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
We're on our way there now...
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Did she accept?
Come on boys, break it up...
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
I only had a few hours.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
