- that's what I mean!
What would you think of me if -
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
This sort of thing!
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Back?
Hello.
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
In his apartment -
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
At the bar - Sidney...
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
I don't think so.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
