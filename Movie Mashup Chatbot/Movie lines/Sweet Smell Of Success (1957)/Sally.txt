If you want me to -
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
I know you do, Sidney.
Yes.
Nothing...
Take a top coat.
I'm used to you...
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
I hate to see you like this --
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
The renting agent and the tailor.
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
But...
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
That's the third time he's called today.
