Hurry back.
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...

Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
