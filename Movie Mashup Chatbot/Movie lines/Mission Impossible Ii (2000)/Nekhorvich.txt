I'm fine..
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
By asking me.
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
Do I?
You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
A visit from an old friend.
