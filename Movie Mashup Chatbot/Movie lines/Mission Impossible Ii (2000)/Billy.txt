What are you talking about?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
Well do you disagree with that?
- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
What you got there, mate?
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
There she is.  I got visual.
I hope there's a place to land.
We're due to take off.
Before we kill her or cure her..
Exactly where is she?
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Then we got'em!
