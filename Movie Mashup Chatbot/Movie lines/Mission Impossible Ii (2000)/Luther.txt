And the check's in the mall.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
Range is two kay.
Not for seven more minutes.
Right.
..in the building...
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
I'm not ready!
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
It is, Billy.
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
I am. She is.
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
So what did he say?
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
She must still be on the property.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Roger that.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Nekhorvich's boss?
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
That simple, huh?
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
It's the transponder.
