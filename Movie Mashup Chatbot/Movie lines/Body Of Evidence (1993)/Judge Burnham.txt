Counsel approach the bench.
You may call your next witness.
Objection sustained.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
You better.  Please answer the question.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
The witness will answer the question.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
