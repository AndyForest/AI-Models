Thanks, Mister D.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney?  She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
Because it hasn't all been erased.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
No -- but I got something.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
I'm trying.
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
So -- where do we start?
I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
How you doin' Mister D?
