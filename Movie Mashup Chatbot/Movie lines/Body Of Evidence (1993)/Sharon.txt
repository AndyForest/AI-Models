Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
It was a place to start.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Why didn't you come to me?
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Talk to me.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
Why did you lie to me?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Where have you been?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
We have to talk.
Is that alright, Frank?
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Yes.
She sounds like quite a woman.
What's she like?
If he files are you going to take the case?
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
He could let you have your vacation.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
If you want me to.
Really.
This is not relaxing.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
That's too bad.
