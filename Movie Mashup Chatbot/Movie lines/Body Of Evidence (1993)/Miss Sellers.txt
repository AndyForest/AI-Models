There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
Yes -- he did.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
We dated for about a month last year.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
Yes.
