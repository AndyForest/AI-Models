It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Increase his heart rate.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Yes.
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
No.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
A massive cardiac arrest.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Yes.
That's what my report will read.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
About three hours.
