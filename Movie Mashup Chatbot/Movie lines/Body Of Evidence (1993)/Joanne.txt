Yes.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yes.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes.
No -- never.
Six years.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Rebecca Lawson.
I assume his girlfriend.
I had some papers to pick up.
A little after eleven.
Because he called me.
No.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Yes.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
No.
I don't know.
P.M.
Three fifteen.
Dristan nasal spray.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
I've been to a few -- yes.
I've tried it.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him.
Yes.
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
That bastard!
Who told you that?
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
I suppose.
Yes -- he mentioned it.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
Yes -- cocaine.
No.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
