It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
Finally!
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
You should have been there...
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
And they don't even know what it really is.
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Anymore ideas...?
What above the curves?!
I can't!
What're we going to do?!
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
So now they believe me.
Indy? Did you talk to them?
I want to go home...
What?
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
Wait -- what're you doing?
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
What is it...?
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
I am -- it looks horrible!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
A what?!
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
What?!
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
Dr. Jones?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
Primitive sexual practices?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
Not leftovers?
I've never been so hungry in my life...
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
He's afraid of something.
Just try and control yourself.
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
What does the writing say?
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
Oh really?
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
It's starting to let go!
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
THE WHAT?!
PET IT??!!
Just one arm!
What?!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
It's pulling me deeper!
What?!
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
A SNAKE!!
A snake!
Indy! Help me!
Somehow I feel safer in here.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
What'd he say now?
Their children?
Took what?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
What do you mean -- how?
What'd he say?
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
You don't look very good.
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
Hey, he's not a waiter...
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
I'm going to puke in it...
Give me your hat...
Figures...
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
You got it!
