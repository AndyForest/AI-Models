I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.

His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.

I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
You understand what he tells us?

Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
There are no stories anymore.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
