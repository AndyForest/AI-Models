You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
You will go to palace there.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
