As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
Just a routine inspection tour.
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
Miss Scott panicked?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Charming.
Interested in local curios?
Who?
What?
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
I believe we're being called to dinner.
