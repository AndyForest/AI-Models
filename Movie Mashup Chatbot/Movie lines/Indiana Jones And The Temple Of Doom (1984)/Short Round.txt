Yeah, that's what happened...
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
What you look at, Indy?

Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Willie, come on!

They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
