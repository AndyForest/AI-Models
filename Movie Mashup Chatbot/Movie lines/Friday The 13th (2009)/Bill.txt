It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Wet. I don't know.
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Hey, guys!
Jack?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Where?
I'll go take a look.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Help you clean up?
Good point.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Trouble?
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
You can only do what you can do.
Almost five.
What'll you do when you leave here?
It still hurts?
Filmmaker.
You're right. It makes no sense.
Maybe I can help?
How come you're leaving?
You okay?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Alice? The others show up?
I finished the boats.
Where's Ned?
Chance to get even?
Roll him over!
Is it stuck?
A short somewhere.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
I had to.
Don't get up. Take a second...
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
For sure.
Where'd you get that stuff?
