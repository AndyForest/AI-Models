I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
I'm sorry.
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
What hath God wrought?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
Holy shit...
What do you want to be when you grow up?
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Jack?
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
Those things can be nasty.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
Girls can't be cowboys.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
There you are dead wrong.
