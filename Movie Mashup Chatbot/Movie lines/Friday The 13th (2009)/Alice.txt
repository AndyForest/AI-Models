Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
The killer is still out there.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
No, no, they're all dead...
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
Good night, Brenda.
I guess...
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
I was careless.
Tomorrow is another day.
What'd you see?
Sure.
Next Friday.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
You told her to sweep the courts.
Cabin B is ready.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
What's the matter with it?
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Marcie?
Okay.
They're off now.
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
It sounded like Brenda.
I don't hear it anymore.
Absolutely.
Well, it hasn't been that long.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
How the... did he get in there?
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
I don't know.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
Artist.
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Oh, my God...
Un-hunh.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
You're welcome.
Sure.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
I'll be along.
How come?
