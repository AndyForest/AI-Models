I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Thanks, Alice.
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
You want to leave?
Any particular reason?
You draw very well.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
For two lonely nights.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
I mean...
How much do I owe you?
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
I got to.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Sure.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
