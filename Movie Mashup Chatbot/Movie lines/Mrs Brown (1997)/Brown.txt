She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
I can't move to tidy.
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
What do you take me for?
It's a diary.
Get out.  Out!
She means it.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
You know nothing about her!
You watch your tongue.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
She'll be worried about me.
I've got my duties to attend to.
I'm getting dressed.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
And she sent no word down?
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
Aye, but will they?
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
What?
She loved him.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
Sixty.
Not bad, not bad.
How much?
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
I speak as I find, Archie.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
So?
Kitchen and lower house.
Louder, girl!
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
What's your name?
Are you all right, Barney?
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Good man.  And is she all right?
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
Hey, Barney.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Whom you address.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
She's busy.
It's the Queen's decision.
Back and upper corridors.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
My own.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
Nobody has any rights over me.
This is a slur on her good name.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
It can wait.  Anything else?
That can wait till the weekend.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
Is that the Queen's request?
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
No.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
Awaiting my orders.
Do you?
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Aye, do.
That's not good enough.
I need a man who knows where I am.
Who'll bring it to me?
How will I know what she requires?
How will I know?
She'll think I betrayed her.
She'll never understand it.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
No loyalty.
Too busy looking after themselves.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
They don't see it.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
So...?
Why do you think I keep her here?
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Aye.
I do what I do.
Why?
Maybe, once.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
I wouldn't know.
This is the top.
I'm not married.
It's nothing.
I'm fine.
I don't think about it.
You sent for me.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
If you hunt, you kill.
Dare say you can be taught.
Do you hunt?
What do you know about the Highlands?
What brings you here?
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Because I have to!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
I'm breaking no promises!
Have I ever let you down before--?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
Ma'am?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am?
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
I heard something.
Aye.
We took a nip of whiskey.
Ah, well...
They're ready now.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
That doesn't make him an expert.
What does he know about the Highlands?
Who by?
Are they worth reading?
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
What?
Aye, ma'am.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Archie.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
I'm glad of it.
She's well, too.
I am.
Aye, ma'am.
Ma'am.
