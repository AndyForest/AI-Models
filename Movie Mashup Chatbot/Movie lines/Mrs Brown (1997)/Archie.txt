Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
It's what the maids are for.
The place is a mess.
You should have someone look after you.
Be careful who sees it.
What's this?
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
Aye.
When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
She'll get over it.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
What are you doing?!
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
The good-looking one.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
You know what I mean.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
How about yourself?
Seventy a year.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
Not down south you don't.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
