A few days, ma'am.
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
I understand he was in a fight.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
