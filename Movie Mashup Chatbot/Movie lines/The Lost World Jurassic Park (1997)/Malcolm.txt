Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Is there an antidote?
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
You are an academic.
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Any damage?
I'm not going, John.
John . . .
So what?
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
I don't believe you.
What are you talking about?
What?
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
Resentful.
Come on!
I'm fine... I'm fine...
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Where does it say that?
How could you possibly?
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
That Richard.
Well, is he?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Is that kid still bothering you?
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
What's he got in there?
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
Something's wrong.
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
I have to find Kelly!
For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
We can't stay in here!
Where's Kelly?
I don't know.
No.
No.
What do you think they want?!
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
?!
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
Our chance to do what?
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
No way.
She's nuts.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
But why?
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
Because it exists.
So that others would know about this place?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Birdshit?
What?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
They're pushing us over the cliff.
Oh, God.
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Are you insane?!
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Think fast, Sarah.
Can you set up?
John Hammond.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
I'm her father.
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
