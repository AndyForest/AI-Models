Are you looking for a problem?
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Oh --
Look!  Sarah!
I think she's with Sarah!
Head for the roof!
It'll hold!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
She's with Sarah!
Come on!
What are they?
Lava?
No way.
What do they want?!
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
It has a broken leg!
There' no reason for name calling.
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
Then this is our chance.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Oh, my God.
She's gutty.
Where's Kelly?
JUMP!
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
I'm trying!
Give it more morphine!
That little black line?
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Oh, no!
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
