No.  I feel something.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?

You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
How do you mean?
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
How did you know?
