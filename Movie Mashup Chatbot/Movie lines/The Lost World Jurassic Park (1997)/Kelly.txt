Dad!
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
What are you guys gonna do?
On the side of that one truck.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
I could come with you.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
That was about a year ago.
Which one?
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
My vacation is over in a week.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I don't even know this woman.
Hi, Dad.
