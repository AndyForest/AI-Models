You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
The NLF has condemned you to death.
It's true.
Don't move, Hacene.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
And how many are we?
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
I don't do that kind of thing.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
But I haven't shot him.
I don't even know your name yet ...
Sure. By shooting at me.
With an unloaded pistol?
Go away.
Where's Kader?
Read it.
Can you read?
Go away!
To show them to the UN, right?
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
No, and neither were my men.
No ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
I think it'll be a success ...
It's a question of habit ...
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
