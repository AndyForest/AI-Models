Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
You must have been dreaming.
When?
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
What are you taking?
Am I really her?
I can't --
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
I want to stop taking those pills.
But then I would be dead now.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
You're lying.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Chris --
You never said you wanted one.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
Then you'll die.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
I'm disgusting.
Don't call me that.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
What's happening to us?
You said he was dead.
What's wrong?
If you're here.
Do you want to stay here?
But that's what happened before.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
You don't want me.
I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
You're the coward.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
I love you, too.
Was she right?
Why did she do it?
But we fought.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Sartorius.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
You don't love me.
I'm glad.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
He has a point.
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
What does Snow think you should do?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
I like that too.
Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Why did you say those things?
What happened to us, exactly?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
What happened?
As I said, then it's God, right?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
You still don't believe in God?
Then it's God, right?
Is it intelligent?
Is it a planet?
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
What do you mean?
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
You talk like an actor.
You go home.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You want to fuck her?
Better.
I wasn't.
Not a very happy poem.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Book?
I want you inside me right now.
We're taking a flight?
To calm my anxiety.
What are they?
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
Don't.
I'll go with you.
Yes.
