Yes.
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Whose side are you on?
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
No, she won't.
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
Not her.  It.
Why did you agree to come here?
Yes.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
In the lab.  With her, probably.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
You want it coming back with us?
Fuck me.  I knew it.
Snow, get up here, now.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
Why do you say that?
