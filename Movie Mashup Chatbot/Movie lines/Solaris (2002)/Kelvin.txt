A puppet.
You're not Gibarian...
I can trust Rheya.
Can it work?
What do you want?
Gibarian.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
How quickly?
You fucking bastard...
Why would you let her to do that?
She'll come back.
You murdered her!
You killed her!
That's fantastic.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
No.  There's no behavior modification.
Listen --
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
Where's his body?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
I want to hear your version.
What happened to Gibarian?
All right.
Maybe you can.
Jesus...
When did this happen?
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
I love her.
Into what?
Her oxygen would have run out.
Yes.
Just get him to stop.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
No.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
Get out --
She drank liquid oxygen.
They come when you sleep.
Human beings can die.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
No.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Not necessarily.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
Why?
What is it?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
I don't know.
To who?
I wish you'd told me.
Will she come back?
Rheya.
My wife.
And professionally?
What was it?
Shut up.
That depends.
How much sleep?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
She was real.  Where did she come from?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Is there anybody else here?
He'll let me in.
Where's Sartorius?
What?
How?
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
How can you be here...
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Where did you go before?
Please.  Don't.
What does it want?
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
I think they help.
I wish you wouldn't.
Is that really what you want?
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Yes, you are --
Who are you, then?
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
I want you here.
Then you won't make it.
I can't stay here.
I never said I didn't.
Neither did I.
Thank you.
You should have told me.
I want every second I can get with you.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
No.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Rheya --
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
I love you.
It's all right.
He is.  But he was here...
Gibarian.  He was here.
Do you?
Not this time.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Rheya.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Those are dreams.
Can you sleep?
No.  I love you.
You... she said I didn't love her.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
When?  When I'm asleep?
Who have you been talking to?
What are you talking about?
Stop.
What's wrong.
Yes.  Yes.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
I think so.
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
You don't know?
I did too.
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
What kind of look?
How old were you?
Where've you been?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
It's something.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
What do you remember?
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
You're better when you take them.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
Let's go home.
Rheya.  Not here.
Stop it.
And tonight?
You didn't look very happy.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
Rheya...
Yes.
To calm your anxiety.
I'll be right back.
Why?
I'll just be a minute.
I need to see Snow.
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
