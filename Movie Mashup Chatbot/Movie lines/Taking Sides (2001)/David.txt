Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
I don't know.
On all what?
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
Yesterday I read that Furtw�ngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
But I promised your mother.
I don't know.
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
Eating is eating... and...
Respect your elders and your betters!
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Your manner.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtw�ngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
and totally irrelevant.
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Why not show Dr. Furtw�ngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
Five minutes.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Yes.
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
I guess it's possible.
Some.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I guess so, sir.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
I'm very sorry.
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
