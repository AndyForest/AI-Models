Our duty is to help Furtw�ngler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
On Furtw�ngler.
Where do you stand on all this?
