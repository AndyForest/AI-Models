I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
How can I know such a thing?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Of course I know what that is.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I don't understand what you mean.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I have illegitimate children.
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
This is absolute nonsense!
Yes, that's what happened.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I'm sorry.
I have no idea.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
That's an outrageous lie!
Yes, I know who he is.
Von der Null?
Von der Null?
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Then you are wrong.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
What telegram?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
I wish to say something.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
I was warned.
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwï¿½ngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
May I ask a question?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
It's the truth.
I made no deal!
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
That is correct.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
