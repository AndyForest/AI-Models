Then you're going to kill me.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
Let Furtw�ngler go. Please.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtw�ngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
Furtw�ngler's in a different category.
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtw�ngler?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
