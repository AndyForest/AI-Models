And ask him about his private life.
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtw�ngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtw�ngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtw�ngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
One of your people told me.
Furtw�ngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
I've remembered something else...
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that -
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
What?
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
So. You wanted to see me.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Show you?
Yes, you remember.
It's Dr. Furtw�ngler's baton, which I stole.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Major.
How could I know what's in the archive?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtw�ngler today?
Me? Never.  Never.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
