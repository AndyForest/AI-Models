Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtw�ngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Dr. Furtw�ngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.

First oboe.
