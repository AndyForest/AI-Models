What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
With more what? More what?
Yeah.
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
What?
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
You bet.
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Yes, David?
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
That's big of him.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
What's that mean?
So what is it?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
What the hell are they doing?
'Dim-shits'?
So, what does the Russki want?
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
I guess you admire musicians.
Where you from, David?
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
I'm Steve. What's your name?
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
I have a duty.
No can do.
What museum?
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
Not yet.
Colonel. Pleasure.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
What's not right?
What is this, Emmi?
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
What's in those files?
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
Mine's the Eleventh.
Think you can get me any of that?
Steve.
And your father was executed.
Your mother, too.
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
You do shorthand and typing?
You live here, in Berlin?
Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Who's conducting?
Okay, so what is it?
Do you know what that is?
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
What?
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
And what happened to Von der Nul?
And what did he say?
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Yes, von der Null.
Tell me about von der Null.
No!
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
And what was that?
Go ahead, be my guest.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
What did Goering say?
Who warned you?
How?
Who?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtw�ngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Steve Arnold...
See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
Why were they going to arrest you?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
Tough, tough!
Your guess is as good as mine.
Sure.
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
Did you call someone you knew?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
I don't buy that.
How come?
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtw�ngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
His private life?
The Miracle Kid.
Who's he?
Never heard of him, who is he?
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
One of my people?
He did?
Yeah?
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Do it, Helmuth.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Show me.
How could I forget?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Helmuth.
Do you know what's in this archive?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
That's what I asked.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
When you got to the crescendo.
Was looking at Furtw�ngler like that?
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
Oh! The evening before, I see...
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Like this bandleader.
They said I was dogged?
Right. Claims assessor.
Jeez, and I never heard of him.
Sure.
Nope.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
