'Please remember that Dr. Furtw�ngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
What does he mean, too correct?
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
And no elbows on the table!
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
I would like to go now, please.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
I can't do this. It's not right.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
Of course.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Major, Major... he's here ...
I'm sorry.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtw�ngler?
No. Ours was damaged.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Three months.
Yes.
Yes.
