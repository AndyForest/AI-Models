You're right... Okay, you're right.
What do you think?

They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
What are you, God?
Hunt with Vince?
Huh?
It's ahead, Vince.
You got it.
Merle --
From Nam?
Well, where's he from?
Is he from here?
Pow.
Pow.
From Nam?
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Yeah... I guess.
I don't think about the shot that much.
The shot?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So do I.
Huh?
Yeah.
I know.
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
Yeah.
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
It's Merle, Sal.
It's not socks, Sal.
Here. Behind you.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
No.
Yeah.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
What?
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
Great. Hey. That's great.
What's that noise?
What's that noise?
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
See you Monday.
Great. That's great.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Don't worry what it says in the book.
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Where's Vince?
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
Sure.
Yeah.
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Never one.
No.
Naw.  Uh-huh.
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
What the hell's that for?
Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
Cynthia! Sure.
Well, who'd you get married to?
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
