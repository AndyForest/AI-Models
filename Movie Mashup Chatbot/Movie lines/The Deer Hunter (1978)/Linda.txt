I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
I'm just so lonely.
I don't know.
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
I see you're going hunting.
You're going hunting?
What are you doing?
Nick?
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
No-o-o!
Oh, it's great. Fine.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
But --
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
How are you?
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
I don't know.
Sure.
I don't know! I don't know either!
Okay.
What?
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
Oh... You know...
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
