Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
You are his friend.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
You are frightened, no?
But I insist.
But you must come in.
