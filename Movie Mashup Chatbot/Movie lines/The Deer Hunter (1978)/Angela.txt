You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Sure. Why not.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
You're back.
