Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
How are you?
I can get in the back.
Buon' giorno.
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
I think that's called looting.
Where did you find that?
Please don't creep around this house.
I don't know what that means.
What?  How could he have?  When?
Ask him.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Where've you been?
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
So you can shoot a pistol?
So was my Patient.
You were in Africa?
Bonjour.
What do you want?
Never heard of it.
Would you like me to?
You'd better be.
Hey! -
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Arguing about books.
Kip's another one.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
I'll probably marry him.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire�  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
This is Captain McGann.
Thank you.  Thank you.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Excuse me -
He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
He needn't disturb you.
He's Canadian.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
Because I'm a nurse.
Are you crazy?
Are you remembering more?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
I'm turning you.
How?  How can you see anything?
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Are you asleep?
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure�
Candaules�you're laughing at me.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
nan
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
No!
I'm not sewing anything else.
So one day we'll meet.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
Kip� I -
Of course.  When?
Nya-nya-nya!
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
What are you up to?
You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
You loved him.
Kip - come and dance with me
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Why would anyone do this?
I follow the wires.
So I follow the wires?
What do I do?
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
Yes, for your hair.
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
I don't think so.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
Oh God.  Oh God.
He's gone, hasn't he?
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Why Picton?
He can't even move.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
When he dies I'll catch up.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
What if you couldn't find him�?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Does he have to go?
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
He's sleeping.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever� you and Lieutenant Singh�
Hello.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
I was looking forward to this evening.
You've got a mustache.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
