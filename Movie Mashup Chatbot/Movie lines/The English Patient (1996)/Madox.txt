May God make safety your companion.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it�hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
When's Clifton picking you up?
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but�  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still�
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Don't be so bloody na�ve.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Which we've overflown twice.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
Bermann!
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
I was talking about the girl.
What did you do?
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Alm�sy smiles and walks on towards the others.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Certainly not.
Why not?
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Alm�sy looks uncomfortable.
