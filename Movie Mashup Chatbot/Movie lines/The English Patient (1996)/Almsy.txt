Tell me about your garden.
Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
Yes.  Absolutely.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
You're wearing the thimble.
Don't talk.
What?
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
We've got to get you out of here.
Why did he bring you?
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Dance with me.
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Why did you hold his collar?
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
Don't go over it again, please.
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
Yes.  A different wife.
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
It's a long song - Szerelem means love�and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
It's a folk song.
I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  Swoon.  I'll catch you.
I can still taste you.
I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
Say you're sick.
Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me.
What do you hate most?
What else?
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
When were you least happy?
When were you most happy?
That makes it harder still.
You don't sew at all!
Good.
I believe you still have my book.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
No.
No, but I think I do.
And the marriage - is that a fiction?
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Yes.  Absolutely.
No.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
Look over there.
You should come into the shelter.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
What's this?
I do not.
Pardon?
Her or me?
He said - be careful.
The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
As the wife of one of our party.
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
Excuse me?
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
That insults them.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
Which stall?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
How much did you pay?
Daskylus�
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
What kind of fossils?
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
Thank you.
And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials�  - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  Isn't that right?
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die F�hrer!  Il Duce.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
What?
Very well.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Safe journey.
What kind of photographs?
There you have me.
Still a car.
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Count Laszlo de Alm�sy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
What?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and�  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Could I trouble you for some water?
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
I told you so.
Right.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
I believe I'm rather late.
Own the desert.
Why do they care about our maps?
What's the matter with you?
In my room.
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility�
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Her hands and feet were tied.
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
