You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn'tï¿½ I couldn't even do that properly.
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
The rest meant nothing to me.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
I see.
Me?
We shall miss you.
Hana tells me you're leaving.
What?
Very true!
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Top Hat.
Irving Berlin.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
Moose.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
I'm still here.
- to her cooking.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I don't think it's indifference.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
I've been told that before.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
Why?  Is he staying?
Really?  That's sudden.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
K is for Katharine.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
That's a different dress.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Your friend?
Yes?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Could I have a cigarette?
I can see my wife in that view.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
I can already see.
Yes.  Dropping off.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Candaules
Thank you.
My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
What are you talking about?
Kip?
This is wonderful!
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
Or my wife's.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
No.
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
