I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
Almï¿½sy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
If I could just see some identification.
Do you have your papers, sir?
I see.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Good morning!
Then you were married?
This was your garden?
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Why?  Are you German?
What about your rank or serial number?
