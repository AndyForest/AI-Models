Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Don't cut me.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
I don't know.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
No.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Well, then ask him his name!
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
I liberated it.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
What if I told you he did this to me?
Who are his ghosts?
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
Rabbit hunting.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Fine.  I'm not looking.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
No.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
Yeah, for a while.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in�have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
Are you Hana?
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
No, now I can't kill you.
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
What did you say?
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Have a drink.
Is there a song you don't know?
For?
Thought you'd never wake up!
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Is it you?  If I said Moose� I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
And you've forgotten yours.
Are you planning to be the exception?
Oh, all over.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
Hello.
