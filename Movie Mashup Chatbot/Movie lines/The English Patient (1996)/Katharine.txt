Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
I know.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
Oh dear.
Shall we be all right?
Don't leave me!
It's so cold.
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Why did you hate me?
It hurts too much.
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
A surprise, he said.
I can't move.  I can't get out.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
No.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Don't do this.
Would you let me pass?
What?
You will.  You will.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Shall we be all right?
That day, had you followed me to the market?
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
You bastard, I was believing you!
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
Arabic?
This is - what is this?
This is empty, just coming!
No.
What?  No!
A lie.  What do you hate most?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Alm�sy nods.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
Now.
Now.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
You sew very badly.
I'm impressed you can sew.
Don't.
Will you please come in?
Will you not come in?
Do they know them?
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Oh my God, the others!
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
Shall we be all right?
This is not very good, is it?
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
What am I looking at?
I'm quite all right, thank you.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
I'd like you to have them.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
Ask Al Auf. Alm�sy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
You sing.  All the time.
Actually, you sing.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
What do you mean, poetry?
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
You felt obliged to.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
Excuse me.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
I don't care to bargain.
I don't want to go back.
Excuse me?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Hello!  Good morning.
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it�
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
What?
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Aren't you?
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Oh.
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Oh really?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
Darling, Peter says I could stay�
How awful.  What will you do?
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Alm�sy, who doesn't look up from his book.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
I don't think so.
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
