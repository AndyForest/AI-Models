Sorry, what's your point?
It's Geoffrey under this.
Have you seen Katharine?
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Appropriate?
You too.  Good luck!
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
A broken car?
Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Right.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereftï¿½
Well, she is!
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
The team is in mourning, darling.
Off with his head!
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
To arm-twisting.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Apprentices.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
