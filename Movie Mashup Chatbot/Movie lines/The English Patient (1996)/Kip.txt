I'll always go back to that church.
Then come with me.
It's what I've learned.
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
I mean home.  India.
Will you come with me?
This is hot!
The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
I try not to expect you.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never onceï¿½ He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
Yes.  Later.
This is what I do.  I do this every day.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
No. But he hands them over.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
You get Hardy.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
For my hair?
Thank you.
I've met you before.
Is something funny?
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
This is making me incredibly angry.
Go away.
What's happening?  Am I needed?
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
What's he saying?
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
