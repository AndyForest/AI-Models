Possibly, Miss.
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Good evening, Miss.
