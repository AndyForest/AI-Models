He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
With what motive?
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Convenient, isn't it?
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
I don't think you locked your door.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
