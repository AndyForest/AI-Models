I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
We know everything.
Goodbye, Betty.
Sometimes.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
I know that.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
I can't answer that.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
Time's up.  I'm off the case.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
They call me Jeff.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichï¿½s, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
If I understand what you meant by that.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
We try to be decent.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You've had dealings with the police before?
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
FLorida?
You must come from pretty far South.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Where's you get it?
What this?
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
That's an evasion and you know it.
Please answer my question.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
I'll have to know a little more than that.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
What?
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
It could have been an accident.
Information.
The only answer I have for you.
You'd be breaking the law.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Thanks.  I don't mind.
Time for a little chat?
I don't.
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
We do, when we get the chance.
It was lying where on the balcony?
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
Quite sure you had no motive?
Where?
Thank you.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
If I can get off.
The usual grind.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
A private joke.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
Thank you.
Recently, then.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
We don't need him.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
Men like you don't need orders.
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
Would you?
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
Let me know when you've identified him
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Floater?
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
So?
Well.  What about it?
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
You can find out.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
Where's the shell?
Was that about the right angle?
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
Not too hard, is it?
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
I'll know when I find it.
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
I've met her.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
So it seems Sergeant.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
Not if it clears the air.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
Not quiet yet.
Positive?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
Oh nothing.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
The card says so, doesn't it?
I'll take your word.
She might.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
That leaves two strangers.
How about Magruder?
I'm interested in who handled it.
What are my orders, sir?
Not too far, I hope.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Two.
I do.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
Yes, sir.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
I don't know, sir.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
No.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
How do you do, sir.
