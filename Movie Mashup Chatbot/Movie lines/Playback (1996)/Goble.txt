Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Why not here?
Get it in half an hour.
Got it on you?
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
You asked for it.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
Open it and count it.
You get it's brother.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
