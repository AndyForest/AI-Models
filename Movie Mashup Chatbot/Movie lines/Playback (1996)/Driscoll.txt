Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
Send that?
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
Got a moment, Inspector?
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
