If I did-I don't-now.
I think you mean that.
Me?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
Would I want to?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Mitchell was dead enough.
Mine?
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
No.  I paid him off.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
In a way.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
Including Killaine.
That's right.
That, and the fun of it.
Wonder what?
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
Cold?
There would be a moon tonight.
See anything?
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when.
Well?
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
How bad is it?  Bad enough for--
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
No percentage in that.
You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
From you, I like it.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
No use waiting, then.
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Try not talking.
Anything I can do about it?
Why?
Us?
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
We'll find out.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
Couldn't be.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
I didn't notice him.
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
Why not?
Want to dance?
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
Cold?
I'm different. I like it fine.
Just who are you, anyway?
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Quarter after one. Why?
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Bad?
You didn't have to tell him that.
Want a spike in it?
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
You tried to run away.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Nice of him.
How did you meet him?
They'll know whether he killed himself.
Sure... but somebody always does..
He got in here how?
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
Dance?
He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
Whatever you say.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
This way.
Who's Goble?
All right. Get him.
Morning. Any calls?
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Got the information on you?
A thousand.
You mentioned information.
For two hundred?
For five hundred, what do I get?
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
What are your rates?
Private eye?
Name it.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
Leave that one lay.
Sometimes.
You, Killaine?
What'll you have, Margo?
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
How are your teeth getting along?
Who told you my name?
So you're not a cop.
All right, let's see the buzzer.
You asked me where it all came from.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
No idea.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
Mitchell was too drunk.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
That COULD BE TOLD.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Doesn't answer the question.
Would that make me a heel?
That must hurt.
A couple of hours.
Could we discuss that some other time?
I wouldn't know.
I never notice the view after the first week.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
Well--good night.
In case you want to have us followed.
How are you two getting along?
How about a cup of coffee?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
No.
Could be.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Yes, I've seen it before.
That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Round of golf Saturday?
How's life treating you?
You're not English.
What?
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
Lay off, can't you?
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
