Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
I think you're drunk.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
I think I'd like to dance.
How do you do?
If I change my mind.
Would you mind?
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
I haven't been invited.
I'm sure you have.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Not tonight.
nan
Yes?
I'm supposing.
Thank you.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Well..
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
How far does this train go?
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
They might think I was running away from something.
Immigration Officer?
How long would that take?
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
Bank?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
Do you think I was faking?
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Magruder does.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
So that I will never be found.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
You-killed-him?
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
If you're doing all this just for me.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Frozen.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Killaine's wise to what?
You leave it.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
Do you have to leave the note?
This must have cost a fortune.
Killaine...
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
And Betty Mayfield--
They'll look for you.
I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
They're going to arrest me.
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
So have I.
Nothing matters.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
All right--following me.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
You don't know who he is?
Absolutely sure.
Then he's--
Then he's got to be a detective.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
They know you here--know your name.
Dance? Here?
Is this the best you can do?
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Certainly not to me.
Dance? Tonight?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
What time is it?
That's putting it mildly.
Bad enough.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
No thanks.
There wasn't any plane.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
That's all there is.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
I don't.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
There's one less tonight.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
Much too late.
No thank you.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Do you think I don't?
I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
I didn't say anything.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
You're drinking it.
And do you amuse the guests?
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
As I said before...
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
What did you say his name was?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
I see.
Your liquor laws..
I see.
No, please.
Ale. I don't mind.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
But even if you were in love with me.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
What will they do to you?
To do what?
Because you think your in love with me?
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
Very ridiculous.
What does he see?
Points very straight to her.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
I expected nothing else.
I don't want to talk.
There isn't anything you can do.
You understand perfectly.
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
The police always do, don't they?
You were there when I last saw him.
Is it a crime?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
We wouldn't have met at all.
I've never been to Florida.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
A graduation present.
Yes.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
I'm sorry.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Who told you I was married?
It is?
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
