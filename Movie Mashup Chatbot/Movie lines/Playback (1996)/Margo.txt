That comedian?
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
And without much discrimination.
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
Martini.
Fascinated.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
He saw my face too.
That's not enough.
You nasty, sardonic--
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
Passkey?
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
And if you didn't believe me?
Now, you're being beastly.
I don't understand.
It does.  May I go now?
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
I am a fool.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
What about me?
I never saw it before.
Warm water, no doubt.
Are you always this witty?
May you what?
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
In an hour, Larry.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
How about your new friend?
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
You already have the checks, darling.
Years, why?
What does it look like?
Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You ought to know why.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Why should I mind?
Nice.
Who's the girl?
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
