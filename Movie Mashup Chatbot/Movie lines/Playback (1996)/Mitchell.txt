What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Just drunk enough.
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
How careful should I be?
Why certainly, baby.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Okay. You win.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
The brush-off, huh?
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
What's the matter?
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
No thanks?
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
You don't know.
Indefinitely?
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Vancouver, B.C.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
How would you know, Brandon?
Did I do something wrong?
Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
A little something on account perhaps?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
I say YES!
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
Be nasty.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
Right.
I told you she's just..
Of course.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
How long have you had it?
What's this?
That's not very kind.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
I have a rough idea.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
So-so.
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
