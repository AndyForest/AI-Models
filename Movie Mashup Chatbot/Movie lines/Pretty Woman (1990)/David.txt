I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
There's no way you could know that.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
Hope to be?
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
I like your hat.
