I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Do I!?  Momma!
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
What kind of school?
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Go for the bucks.
I pray for that.
Dummy.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Where do you fit?
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Yeah.  I just got it.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Was that you?
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
In Beverly Hills?
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Why'd he want you?
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
'Lo.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
Carlos had some great rock.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
