Who are you going after next, sir?
Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.
Congratulations, sir.
I talked to some developers about the land.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
Storage, I think.
