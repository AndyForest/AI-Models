You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
I... I would take advantage of it.
Yes.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
Mr. Harris.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
You've got a lot of nerve.
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
