Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
We can reach an understanding on this.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
You're not getting any navy contracts.
Twenty-five percent.
Who indeed...
What?
You what?
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
What's that long building over there?
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
How?
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
You're making the right decision, sir.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
Vivian...
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
You're packing.
It felt good.
I got tired of hating my father.
It was a business decision.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
What do you mean?
I've never treated you like a whore.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
I know.  I'm glad.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
What happened to him?
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
The opera.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
You won't.
Shush.  Of course you can.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
I really am sorry.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
Vivian...
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Vivian, what the --
Ready to stomp sod?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Shall we mingle?
He's good at what he does.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
I think it's exciting.
He died a long time ago.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
No.
Dinner can wait.
Please.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Good.
Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Was someone rude to you?
Why not?
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
I have work to do.
Television?
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
And that's the way the game is played.
I'm sorry.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Thank you <u>very much</u>.
I think you'll approve.
The Rex.
This isn't a date.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Did you buy some clothes?
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
I'm not just talking about sex.
Done.
All right, two thousand.
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
Of course.  How much?
I'm in town until Saturday.
All right.  How much for the week?
Don't drown.
Where'd you learn to do this?
Not... quite.
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Vivian --
By breaking up a company's assets --
I sell them.
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
I buy companies.
No?  Why's that?
Do you ever... enjoy it?
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
Mmm, I could tell.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
Occupational hazard?
Did you sleep well?
No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?
Good morning.
What do you like?
Yes...
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Try a strawberry.
It's a very good year.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
And why do you say that?
Uh-huh.
Let's talk some more first.
Fair enough.
Always.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Exactly.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
You know how to drive a stick?
Get in.  This side.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Fine.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
You're joking.
For the whole night?
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
So do day jobs.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
What's your name?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
New York.
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
Not exactly.
No.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
That's ridiculous.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
No, you look like a hooker.
Yes.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
What's that?
Afternoon.
Thank you.
My what?
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Yes.
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Have a good day, gentlemen.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
Let him answer.
Give me twenty minutes.
Why?
I'm up.
Goodbye, Bill.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
You're being ridiculous.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
Why do you want to know?
Vivian's in sales.
Yes...
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
We just did.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Do it.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
No one you know.
What time's diner tonight?
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
I'm here.
I'll bring it back.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
I want to.
Love this car!  Is it new?
No.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
