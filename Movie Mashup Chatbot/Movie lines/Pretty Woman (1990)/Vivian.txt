He's not really my uncle.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
Georgia.
You don't know anything about me.
It's... it's not like that.
No.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
I didn't think so.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
Aw, don't... no...
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
It was good.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Business.
Right.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
What did you do to him?
You just did.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
Did you?
I more than liked it.
But don't they have it in English?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
I've never been on a plane before.
Huh?
Where are you taking me!?
What if someone tries to steal it?
What if I lose it?
Edward, I can't.
What's that?
Do I look okay?
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
Fuck off.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Real genuine guy.
You did.
What id we run into someone I know?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
You still mad at'm?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
You always been rich?
What about dinner?
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Come with me?
Okay.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Uh-uh.  No work.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
You liked the guy, though.
You're upset, huh?
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
You're forgiven.
Oooh!
Hello?
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
Any good?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
I got a dress, yeah.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Holy shit.
Three.
But you want days too.
Four thousand.
Five full nights... days too?
It'd cost you.
What?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
What are assets?
What?  Why?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
... dollars?
No shit.  They expensive?
"Occupational hazard".
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Where'd you go?
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Why?
Oooh, thank god.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
I've known a lot of everybody.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Do you plan everything?
Can I have some chips?
Diet coke.
Off the boulevard.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Why?
Better believe it.
What?
Edward... you got it!
What's your name, lover.
Three hundred.
You couldn't afford it.
No, but it's getting there.
I never joke about money.
For an hour.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
It pays.
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
What motel you staying at?
You're not from L.A., huh?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Stolen?
Nice car.  Yours?
Sit... and spin.
The price just went up to ten.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
You looking' for some company?
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Couple a hours.
You sure you won't come with me?
Want a pair of boots?
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
It was great.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Kit...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Who did you think?
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Yeah.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
He... he just does.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Kit!  Where've you been?
He's not gonna want us.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
Looks slow tonight.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
I bet.  That was our rent!
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
You bullshittin' me?
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Yeah, what?
Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
Oooh, I love those.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
Okay.
What?
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Hi, Barney!
Me?
Professionally?
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Steak spoon!
I like steak.
But what if they serve soup?
What if they serve soup?
Hmmm... I vonder vich.
But I always eat like this.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Will I like it?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
I got a dress.
Niece?
Vivian.
I... Edward...
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I'm just going to my room.
I was in here yesterday.
Do you remember me?
'Scume me.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
What is with you?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I'm just looking, thanks.
Get out!
Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
I think it's great.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
What?
Yeah.  Thanks.
