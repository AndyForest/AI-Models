Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
The young lady staying in your room?
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Miss Vivian.
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Miss Vivian --
Then you would use your--
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
They will serve salad.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
You'll like it fine.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
What's your name?
And who is that?
You're a guest here?
