All this because of that whore!
Edward, we've been together ten years.
You broke my nose.
What!?
Have you lost your mind?
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
I don't think there's any sense in --
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Did I wake you?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?
Doing what?
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
But, Edward...
We're letting them slide?
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
What!?
I know a lot of nice girls.
Edward, did you hear me?
Oh, god, what?
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Cynthia's not coming?
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
What's up, where you going?
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
I just might do that.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
Having a good time, Vivian?
