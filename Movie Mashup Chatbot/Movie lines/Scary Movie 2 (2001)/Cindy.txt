Alex, what are you doing?
I think he wants me.
I found a picture of his wife.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Are you okay?
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Hey, I have an idea...
It's coming!
Oh my God! We're dead!
Help!
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Psychology.
Thanks.
Really? That's amazing.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Hot dogs.
What should we get?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Then what are we going to do?
Oh.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Listen to me I --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Feel that?
Can you feel that?
He's here.
What about you, Buddy?
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Hugh Kane.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
It looks like the furnace.
Alright!
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Shhh!
Buddy...
Okay.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Hi Buddy.
Okay. See you later, friend.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
No. I never date outside my race.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
But he'll kill her!
She killed herself a week before he died.
Okay, I get the point.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
What, you think I did this to myself?
I think so.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Where's Shorty?
Right behind you.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
How about these buns?
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
Oh, right.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Noooo!!!
This can't be happening?
Both of them?
It was you...
Stop! --
Not in a thousand years.
Stop touching his brain!
Hanson, please.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
I'm Cindy.
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Alright, let's take a vote...
I'll go.
What are we gonna do?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Just wait, you'll see.
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
No, my friends are right here!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Yes, we made it!
Father!
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Are you?
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
Did you do that?
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Am I cool now?
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Oh.
Huh?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
You could use the grade, huh?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Don't touch me!!
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
I wouldn't go that far.
Got a problem with that?
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
What are you getting at, Professor?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
I got it!
Got my camera right here.
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
