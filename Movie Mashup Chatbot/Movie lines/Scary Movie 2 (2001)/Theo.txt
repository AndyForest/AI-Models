Would you die already?!
Never happened!
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
That means more screen time for us.
Let her go, Cin.
So, whatever happened to her?
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
Are you okay?
She's right. We should stick together.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
Of course. So sexy.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
What are you working on?
Hello Dwight.
