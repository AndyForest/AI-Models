Yes!!!!
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Made you say it!
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
This part removes the sense of humor.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Yo son, check this out.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
