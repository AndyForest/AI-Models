Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Do I know you?
Cindy, what's going on?
Okay.
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
Ouch!!
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Ray, run faster.
Where's Shorty?
He's so brave.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
No, stay.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Hello Ray.
