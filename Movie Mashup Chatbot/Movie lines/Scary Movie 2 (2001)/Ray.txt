Okay.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
He's right. I should go first.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Yeah, me too.
You sure?
So, I guess I can go now.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Shhh... It's okay.
Hello Brenda.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
It's the sequel.
It's okay.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
You're not wearing a belt.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
My help?
You never could feel your legs.
Second best.
Don't worry, I got your back.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
"Fucked me."
"Fucked me."
"Fucked me."
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
What does it say?
I woke up naked, too.
