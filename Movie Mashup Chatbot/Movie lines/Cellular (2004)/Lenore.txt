I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
Taking messages.
Don't you have children?
Do I hear a woman's voice?
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
He's seen both of us now.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Any minute.
Nels?
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Allow me.
Lose the hardware now.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Five ... six.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
You won't live to see it.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Took preparation.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Both hands on your lap.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
That's not good enough.
Only one way to find out.
Naturally.
You're the man with the gun.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Why are we stopping?
Think you could do a picture of me?
They did some great job of reforming you.
Any idea where you're going?
The money, Nels ... ?
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Do you think they'll walk away?
259-7881.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
Did you hear that?
He wants 75 back.
I'm still okay.
Stop talking like that!
You wouldn't --
You could've hit me.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
A typical fuck-up.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Do you have to point that?
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
Who's in back?
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
I thought it was inspired.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
There isn't any such person.
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Hand me the phone.
They put their hands all over me.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
You're going to let them get away with this?
Why didn't you just shoot them?
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
It's locked.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Why can't it be her?
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
Yes.
I can't do it.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Yes sir.
Yes.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
God, if he doesn't come back --
What did you do?
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
Yes?  Yes?
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
No.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
Don't say that.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
Even if you found us -- what then?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
What do you mean?
The City National on San Vincente.
The one in Brentwood.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
What's happening?
No.
That's not her.
I can hear you again, clearly.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Our house always needs touching up.
What do you do for a living?
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
And that was the end of it?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
A woman?
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
How much time do you have left on it?
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
What are you doing now?
What about the others?
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Why isn't anyone answering me?
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
26th off Wilshire.
"Theo?"
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Please.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
No -- nothing.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Then hang up!  Do it!
Because you know you'll be killing us.
You won't disconnect.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
My name is --
I don't believe you.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
They're holding my husband downstairs.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
Will you let me explain!
You don't understand.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
