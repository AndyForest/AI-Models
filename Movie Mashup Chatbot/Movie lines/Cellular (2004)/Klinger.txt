Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.

In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Got your badge?
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.

We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.

Make a "U" and go back.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.

That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
You switched license plates?
