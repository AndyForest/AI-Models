I told you I should've cuffed him.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
Can you make him stop!
How do we get back to the freeway?
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Yes sir.
You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!
Lady, don't let him do it!
What's this?
Let's have your license, mister.
Why would I do that?
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
You never miss a trick.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
You can tell she was really worried about me.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
