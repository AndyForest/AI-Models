I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
You could've killed us.
Give me 20 minutes at least.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
What am I supposed to do?
I thought you said you could handle him.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Are you busting my chops or what?
In your dreams.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
How do you know?
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
Five minutes.
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
I can see the benefit in that.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
What does it take to kill you?
Who's this?
Yeah?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
You want us to get ourselves killed?
There's two police cars now.
The fuck I will!
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
Call me "Nels."
What's he doing?  Answer me!
