Yeah.  Why don't we?
Seems like it.
Don't worry.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
And then?
And not a nickel.
Negative.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
You should've done all this before.
It's in the process.
We're waiting on you.
We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
I don't know what you mean.
Satisfied?
Talk to the man.
You'll see her.
Just relax.
It's your call.
Stay there.
We don't see you.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
308-9962.
Sure.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Some loyalty.
We can be there.
What time frame have you got in mind?
Pass.
Where do we meet?
There are no guarantees in this life.
Keep talking.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
Whatever you say.
Twenty percent.
Who are you working for?
