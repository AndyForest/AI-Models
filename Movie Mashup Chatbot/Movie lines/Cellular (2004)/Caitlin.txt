I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Was someone in an accident?
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
What if they do question the authenticity?
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
You gotta just look the other way.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
Will you two cut it out?
Theo wants to talk again.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
What was that for?
Who's on the phone?
