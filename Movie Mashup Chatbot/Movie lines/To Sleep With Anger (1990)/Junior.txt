What is it, noontime?
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
I ought to break your damn neck.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
When did you talk to Harry?
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
