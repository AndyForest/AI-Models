You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
