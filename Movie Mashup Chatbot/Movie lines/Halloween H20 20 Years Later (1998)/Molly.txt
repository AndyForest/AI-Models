Yeah.
I'm okay.
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
You really think Eddie killed her?
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Then I'll get caught.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
I can see that.  Why?
What are you doing here?!
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
I can't afford to get caught.
Not me.
You stole it?
Where'd you get it?
Michael Meyers!
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Okay... thank you.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Where's Shane?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Shit, Linda!
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
You're unbelievable.
What's this?
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
I did alright.
