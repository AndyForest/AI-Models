Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
What?  Where is she?
I'm not leaving without her.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
He found you, didn't he?
I don't know.
Why didn't you tell me?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Now you're joking, right?
You some kind of fugitive or something?
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Just forget it...
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Nothing.
You're twisted.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
My life is a living hell.
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
What the --
You're so predictable.
Better?
Here, take my jacket.
You look kind of cold.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Then you come out here.
Can I come in?
I came to see you.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
Why not?
I borrowed it.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
