Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Carter.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Care to join me?
I can be real stiff.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
Where?
Carter.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
No blood on the knife.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
I like a woman who takes control.
Well, when you put it that way.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Why am I here?
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Carter.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Mind if we sit down?
I'll be damned.
