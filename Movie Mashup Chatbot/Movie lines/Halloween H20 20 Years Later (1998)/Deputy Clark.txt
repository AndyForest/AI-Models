Doesn't look good.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
It's Amy Kramer.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
