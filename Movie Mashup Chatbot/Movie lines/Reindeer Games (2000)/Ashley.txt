Gabriel!
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
To all those cons...
He wants... your "sister"...
No, baby. He wants me.
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
NO!
You promised me!
Gabriel, you promised!
YES!!!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Don't hurt him...
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Gabriel!
What are you doing here?!
Gabriel, let him go --
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Gabriel -- !
Thank you.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
You said it a million times!
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
What are you talking about?
What?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who wouldn't.
You shouldn't have.
You... you... YOU --
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
They all are. Football's on.
No.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
He says he wants it now.
He wants to see your map.
Part of... with them?
Nick, what are you talking about?
I don't know...
What?
I love you, Nick...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
Nick, the ice is --
Nick, what happened --
That guy knows you?
So does it look a lot different?
Nick...
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
They're truck drivers.
What?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Not without you.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
No!
I thought we'd have a few more days.
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
Jack. Jack Bangs.
Gabriel!
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
I love you!
No, Nick, no --
Nick, please, it's me --
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
He'll kill you.
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
Nick, I love you --
Nick, what are you --
Nick --
Nick, no --
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
Nick...
NICK!
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
We could live it up and --
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
You forget where I work?
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
You need a COAT!
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Then he shoulda signed his name.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Yes it was all you --
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
No, c'mon --
No --
What.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
You are to me.
Saw me --
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Radio said.
Yeah.
Radio said negative five.
