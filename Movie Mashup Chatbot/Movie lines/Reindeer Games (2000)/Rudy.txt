I never told you my name.
But I never said Rudy.
No --
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
I'm glad it was me.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
I saved your life.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
Yeah. That's love.
Well. I'm going home.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
I'm almost done.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
We'll need one.
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
They'll have guns.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
Don't say my name...
You saved me.
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
Get your own room.
Get your own room, Ashley.
We? What "we"...
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
They've never done a robbery?
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
He working for them on this one?
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
Canada.
...maybe I die for Nick...
Nick died for me....
Your pen palls dead, lady.
You're in on this.
You told him about Nick's letters.
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
You're not hearing me here --
Get the hell off of me!
JESUS CHRIST!
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
You sold him out.
You motherfucker.
What's going ON!!!
What the fuck is going on.
...the truck driver...
Your brother...
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
NO!
I'll see what I can do.
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
Well, I don't know about that --
Beauty and fragrances.
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Ashley, Jesus --
Where the hell are you going?
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Tell me again.
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
One more. Smile. One more.
Smile.
Do that again.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
No, hey, I like your coat --
No, no --
I don't think it's negative five.
Negative five?
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
How'd you know my name.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
How'd you know my name...
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
You gotta be kidding me.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
I'm no threat without a gun.
Six men means six guns.
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
You need six.
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
No, Gabriel... no...
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
NO!
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
Nnn... nothing...
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
...never... tried...
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
I'm gonna need some money.
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
Do I get a country-western name?
At least gimme video poker.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Might as well be.
More than you know.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
They won't recognize me.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
And I worked there. For a year.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
This isn't the Tomahawk.
I said, who the hell made the map?
Hell. Ten?
Hey, it's... been two years --
Christmas... Eve...
Five million?
I don't know.
Hey.
Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
No. It's her brother.
Her brother.
A station wagon in Canada.
What college.
Bam Bam.
Samantha.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What?
I had better sex in prison.
Wish I had a brother like you.
She says a lot of things.
I never worked at no casino.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
I shared his cell!
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
No, you can't --
You... you don't know me --
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
What?
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
I promise you, I didn't know!
Merlin, I didn't know --
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
Not with you.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
You gave them me.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
How'd you know I'd do it.
And you set me up.
She set them up. All of them.
NICK!!!
NO!!!
YOU TELL HER!
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
No, man! No, no, no!
GUARD!!!
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
GUARD!!!
GUARD! GUARD!
Standing right here, man!
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Good for you. Protein.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
What, working security?
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Oh.
She's using a new perfume.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
I'm just talking.
I'm just saying.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And some pecan pie.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Hot chocolate.
Not yet.
Ain't there yet.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Haven't thought about it.
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Switch seats with me.
You're hitting for MY cards!
POP! That was My card!
That was my king!
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
They changed the layout.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Who the hell made this map.
I'M NOT NICK!
