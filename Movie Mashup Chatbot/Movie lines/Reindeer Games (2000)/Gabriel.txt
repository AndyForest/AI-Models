That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
He'll be dead when he does.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
I've been doing good, though.
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
-- till he fucked his parole --
Searching for a money man...
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
...whoever she is.
He wants the money.
We're talking, aren't we?
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Is this him!?
A man of some travels.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
Must have a way with stationery.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Ash?
Ash?
Get in the CAR!
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Can't be attracting attention, right?
'Tis the season, convict.
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
No gun.
No, you're not.
No way.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
No.
NO.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
What's the code?
Sing it in pictures, Nick.
Start singing.
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
What'd you tell that casino manager?
Got something to say to me, Nick?
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Don't tip.
You got one hour.
Get out.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
You do.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
Put it on.
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
Rather be back in the Mountain?
Bring back some memories, Nick?
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Why not.
Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
So what the hell good are you...
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
We walked the place for a week.
What the fuck are you talking about.
I did.
What?
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
The hell you don't.
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
You knew the place --
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
What's her greatest fear?
Be more specific.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
What'd they call her in college?
What'd they call her in high school?
What's her middle name?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
Where's she work?
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
So you could get down her chimney.
So you could get with my sister.
But you were saying you were...
You're not Nick Mason...
You what...
Put him in the truck.
Who are you now.
The hell I can't.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
Where the HELL did he go?
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Leave the tree.
Take 'em.
GO!!!
OPEN IT!!!
Where is he?! Where is he?!
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
Show's over.
