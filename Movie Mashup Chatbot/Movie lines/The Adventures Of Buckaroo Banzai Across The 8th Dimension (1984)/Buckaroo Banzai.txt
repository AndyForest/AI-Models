There's another one we owe 'em.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
We will, old fried, we will.
Arachtoid.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
You okay?
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
The deuce you say.  That crate!
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Then what?
Same one you had yesterday?
I'm starving...somebody, help.
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
Dead.  Damnit!
What is it, Tommy?
It?  Who does?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Let her out. In my custody.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Anybody we know?
Now!
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
The door's locked.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
Got a casualty list?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
Don't shoot!
To get my guns.
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
What? How do you know that?
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Stay here, I'll be back.
It's too dangerous.
Absolutely.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Never.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
You don't wanna know.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
She was killed, Penny.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
You keep an eye on it.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Another 'you'?
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
No, I don't.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Who?
Pretty terrible shot.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Everybody okay up here?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
He offered you money?
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Raise your hand...where?
