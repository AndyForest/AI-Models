Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
Apache?
You're a welcome sight...
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
What crate?
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
First thing I did.
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
Vanished. Thin air.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
