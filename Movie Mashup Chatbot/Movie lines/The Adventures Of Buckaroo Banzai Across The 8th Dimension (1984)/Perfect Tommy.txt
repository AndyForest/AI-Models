New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
Where's the professor?
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Let her out?  She's a killer.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
She wants a picture.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Asshole probably got lost.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
Pictures don't lie.
It's a spittin' image.
Pick those up, Reno.
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Bet I do.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
