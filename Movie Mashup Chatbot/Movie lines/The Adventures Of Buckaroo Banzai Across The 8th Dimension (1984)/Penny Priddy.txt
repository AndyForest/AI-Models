I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
Believe in Penny Priddy?
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Go where?  Where're you going?
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Oh, my.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Any time.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Which?  The one in my throat.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
It's kinda hard this way.
The girl I remind you of.
Was she pretty?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Go away.  Let me rot?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
This is so embarrassing...
Better than him.
What's his problem?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
