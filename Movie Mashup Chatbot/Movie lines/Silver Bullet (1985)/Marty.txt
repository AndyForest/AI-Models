All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Jane-
Please, Uncle Al.
Will you marry me, Jane?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Where's Mom?
Yes. Go away.
Stop it!
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Rats...
What kind of noises?
What?
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
Well... it is his third.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
What if I say no?
But Uncle Al! You said-
Yeah? Really?
Will you do it?
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
I saw what I saw.
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
There! You see!
I told you!
I told you!
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Well... was it a prescription?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Was it a prescription?
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
What is it?
Yeah... sure.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
Yeah! What is it?
Sure.
I don't get you.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Do I need one?
What?
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Don't call me dear boy.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
What if it's some kind of monster?
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
No.
Yeah.
Mom-!
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
