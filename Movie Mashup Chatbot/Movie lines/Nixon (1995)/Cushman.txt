That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
Then his office will be fine.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
