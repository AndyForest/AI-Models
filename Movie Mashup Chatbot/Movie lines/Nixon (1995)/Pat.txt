There'll be time for that.
It'll be over soon.
No.  They're not yours.  They are you. You should burn them.
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
Why didn't you?
Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
You.  What' you're doing --
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
When?
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
Congratulations, Dick.
You're a long way from Whittier.
Penny for your thoughts.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
You personally?
They're all your enemies?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
I've missed you.
He looked old, didn't he?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Can I just ask for one thing?
Then I'll be there for you.
And then you'll be happy?
Do you really want this, Dick?
I don't want them to love me.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Were you planning to tell me?
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
You don't have to go.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Is that the truth?
Are you serious?
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
Dick, don't...
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
I want a divorce.
Not that.  Us.
It's over, Dick.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
You're not a failure, Dick.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It makes us human ...
I know ...
