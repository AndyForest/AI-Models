Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
So, what's this about, Dick?
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
Her name's Sandy ...
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
We'll see about that.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
