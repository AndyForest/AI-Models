I understand that, sir.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
No, we have nothing to hide.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
Uh huh ...
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
Executive clemency ...
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
To protect his people.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
Is it?
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
