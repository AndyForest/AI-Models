Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
