Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Thou must.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
I expect more from thee, Richard.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
