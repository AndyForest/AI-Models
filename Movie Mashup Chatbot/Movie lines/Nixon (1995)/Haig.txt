Sir?
I know it well, sir.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
How do you see this?
Lincoln used it.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't get around it.
Sir, the deadline is today.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
He's completely lost touch with reality.
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.
Who?
About a dozen.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
That's what they're doing.
I don't have a pistol.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
No, sir, you did not.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
May I say something, Mr. President?
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
Sorry ...
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
