John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
I'll bet he would.
Yes ... I got the money.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
The White House.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Mein Kampf?
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
