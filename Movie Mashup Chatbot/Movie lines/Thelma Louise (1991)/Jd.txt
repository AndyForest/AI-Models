How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
Aw, God.
Who's the nut?
You're a little angle, you are.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.

I am the great and powerful Oz...
That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
That sounds nice.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Thelma?  It's me.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Did you get married real young?
So how come you don't have any kids?
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
