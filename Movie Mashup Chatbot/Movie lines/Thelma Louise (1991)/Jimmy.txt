Oh, great.
It's him.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
I always knew that.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Who's your friend?
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
I'm choking on it.
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
Will you at least see how it fits?
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever?  What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Who is it?
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
Hey, peaches.
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Peaches.
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Call me back.
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
You're in Oklahoma?!
Christ, sure... yes!
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
What the fuck is going on?
Where'd y'all go?
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
