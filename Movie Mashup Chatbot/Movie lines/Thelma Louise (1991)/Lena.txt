It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
