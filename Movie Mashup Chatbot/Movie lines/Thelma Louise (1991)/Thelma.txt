Go fuck yourself.
Darryl.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
You want anything special for dinner?
Hon?
Have a good day at work today.
Hon.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
I'm spinning.
Stop.
Oh shit.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Tell me.
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
How?
What?
You're a bank robber?
What did ya do?
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Louise, is that you?
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
A regular outlaw.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
You're a good friend.
Go.
Then let's not get caught.
Now what?
God!  It looks like the Army!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
What in the hell is it?!
Way up ahead!
What in the hell is that up there?
Louise!
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
You're a good friend.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
Why?
Oh.
What?!
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
How long do you think that'll take?
How far are we from Mexico?
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
Yup.
What?
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Does that mean suck my dick?
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
Pass him!
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
You're drivin'.
It'd have to be pretty good.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
We can change our names.
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
Me too.  I feel awake.
You awake?
No.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Eeuww.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Louise?
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
You know why.  You already said.
Are you alright?
Yeah, you want it?
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Just asking.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Hit it.
Sorry!
Shoot the radio!
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Harlan.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
We should have just ignored him.
Just ignore him.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
This is so beautiful.
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Like a Chihuahua?
What little dogs?
Before.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
Whaddo we do?
Now what?
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Idaho?
Louise?  Where are we?
You're right.
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
I... I...
What.
Let's get it over with.
Alright, Louise!
Why not?!
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
What for?
Yeah.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Try to.
Yes!  I believe I am!
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Lemme see the map.
Well, I just...
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Drive!  Drive away!
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Taking a shower.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Nothing.  It got messed up.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
I won't wait up.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  Imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  He is a lucky man.
So what are you gonna tell him?
I heard that.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
She thinks he's a pig.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
I wish we could've brought him with us.
Louise.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
Will I be?
Call him?
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
But you think he fools around.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Did you finish thinking?
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Give me the keys.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
What do you mean?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
I'm cash poor.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
So this is all my fault, is it.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Yes.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Louise.  Where are we going?
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Oh my God.
Ready when you are.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Well, just relax, will ya.  You're makin' me nervous.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Yeah!
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Isn't this fun?
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Whose place is this again?
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Okay.  I will, too.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
I'll call you right back.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
Where you goin'?
We're fine!  How are you?
Hi!
