No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
See ya.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.

What?!
Uh-huh.
What.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
