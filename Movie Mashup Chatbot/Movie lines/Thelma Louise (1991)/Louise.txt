You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
No!
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Hey.
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
We're both fine.
Yes, sir.  I know.
I've been better.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
Why now, Jimmy?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Maybe.
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
It's nothin' like that.
Maybe.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
It's me.
Hello...
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
What?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Who did it?
Is that how you answer the phone?
Okay.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Tell me now.
Can't it go to any office?
Not yet.
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
Do you love me?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Am I in trouble?
In the back?
Yes.
Oh yeah.
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
You, too, sweetie, the best.
Go?
What are you talkin' about?
We're not giving up, Thelma.
All this for us?
It's grand!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
Where?!
What?!
How do you stay so positive?
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
You too, sweetie, the best.
You're crazy.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
What?!  What d'you think?!
Shit!
Shit!
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
We've gone insane.
You know what's happened, don't you?
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
We can live in a hacienda.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Good.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
He said they're charging us with murder.
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
Thelma, that is not an option.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
What do you mean?
Yes, Thelma?
Whatever.
I said all that?
What?
What'd I say again?
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Yeah.
You do?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Yes.
I believe you.
Ready?
Sorry!
What?
I am really sorry about this.
About how fast was I going?
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
Thelma!
Now, Thelma, that is not...
What?!  What about him?!
What?!
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
What?
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Well, you got it now.
Gosh.  It sure is.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
I can see that.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
You mean now or before?
Yeah.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Now what what?
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Just past Boise City.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
It won't work.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
I want you to call Darryl.
Thelma.
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Litterbug.
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
You're disturbed.
You think you've found your calling?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Holy shit.
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
What happened?
No.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
You left that guy alone in the room?
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
What's wrong with you?
What happened to your hair?
Have another drink, Thelma.
How do I look?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Thelma kinda took to him.
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
That's puttin' it mildly.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
What did Darryl say?
It's probably not a good idea.
I don't know.  I won't be.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I think better when I drive.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
You're not touchin' that car.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
Why are you actin' like this?
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
It means shut up, Thelma.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
Which part?
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
West.  Left.
Get the car!
Get the car.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Exactly.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Maybe.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Thelma!
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
How come he let you go?
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
In case of what?
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
Are you going to apologize or not?
Say you're sorry.
You got that right.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
We been seein' you all along the way.
