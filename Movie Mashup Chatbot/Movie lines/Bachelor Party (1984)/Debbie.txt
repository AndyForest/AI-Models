Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
You're kidding.
What do you mean?
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
I'm going now, Cole.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
No, Cole, I...
Cole, we've got to talk.
Cole?
You're so romantic...
Yeah.
Let's get naked.
Yes...
I don't believe you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Let go of me!
Rick, you're lying!
I can't trust you!
Why don't you get undressed.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I love you.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Your mother's not dead.
You're really pissing me off.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Gonna get married...
You better not have too much joy.
Um... that's very relaxing.
That feels so great.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
I can't sleep.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Are you going to have women at your party?
It looks awful.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
I think your dinner's burning.
What are we having?
God, you're a slob.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Let's go.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
I hope those guys are all right.
Quiet, Mother.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
Why is Cole here?
Great, Mom.
