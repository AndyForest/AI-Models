Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
I've decided not to run for President.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Fan out and look for them.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Maybe it had something to do.
So does Debbie.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
The car for Debbie?
I'm very happy for you two.
The best.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
What is this person's story here?
I'm marrying Debbie.
Not interested.
No.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Cole...
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
Bond... James Bond.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Are you okay?
You're on.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
I am committed. I love you.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Good...
C'mere.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
About what?
What's the matter?
Oh... I got something for that.
Huh? Wha...
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
But a fabulous cook.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
I didn't know you were into that.
Hookers beat you up?
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
It's true.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
What the hell are you doing?
Really?
You okay?
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
What do you mean, it changes?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
Are any of those right?
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
The end.
Oh, no!
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Feel free.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
I'd love that.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Can't I just maim it a little?
Oops!
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
My Debbie?
Who?
I'm saved. Let's party!
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Who's your friend?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
He look familiar?
How 'bout this?
What's this?
Who was that?
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Oooooo.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
About what?
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Under the table!
What the hell is that?
I'm not really hungry.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
Olivier's in that, right?
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
Right... Think it over.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
