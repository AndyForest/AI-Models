This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Why?
What are you...
Screw you!
Your whores never showed up.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Yes.
Screw that.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
What's going on?
Let's have a toast.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Let's go.
Screw you...
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Milt?
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
I'll take some.
I want women.
You're a pimp?
