I know what I'm doing... Go!

Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.

Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
