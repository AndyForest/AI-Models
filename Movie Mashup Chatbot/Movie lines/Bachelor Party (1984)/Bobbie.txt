Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Does Cole know about this?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.

I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.

He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
