All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Keep me informed.
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Nice shot.
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Any time, Al.
Great bathing suit.
A real turd.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
No sob story is going to change my mind.
Rick!
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
All right, who serves?
No, Brett, I...
The phone made me do it!
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
