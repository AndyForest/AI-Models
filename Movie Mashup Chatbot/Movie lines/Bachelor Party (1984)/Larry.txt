That's it.
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
It's Bullwinkle.

I couldn't find any razor blades.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.

Yeah, I guess so.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
I just want to be alone.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Right.
You want to share it?
