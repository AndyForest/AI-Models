Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
