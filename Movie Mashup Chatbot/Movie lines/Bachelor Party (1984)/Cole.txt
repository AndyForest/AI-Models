He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
She's mine!
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
I love that car.
Great car.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
I don't want any trouble.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Seventy-five hundred.
Five thousand dollars.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
I want Debbie.
And...
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Yes I did.
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, sir.
1002.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
But how can I do that?
I've tried to change her mind.
Yes, sir, I am.
Thank you, sir.
Sure have...
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
