Cole, please stop.
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
What?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
...I don't know.
They talk to you?
You see ghosts, Cole?
Dead people?
They?
Cole, you're scaring me.
Where is she?
You can see her?
Oh my God.
They did?
Yeah.
Communicate?
I'd give anything to have been there.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
So who moved it?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
Lots of things.
They're right here.
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
...He doesn't get invited places.
