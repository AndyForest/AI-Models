Goodnight, Malcolm.
Tell me.
Why did you leave me?
Why, Malcolm?
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
--My God.
Wow. They called you their son.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Don't step in the horse manure.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
I trust you... Besides, I don't know if I'm up for the Amish today. You can't curse or spit or anything around them.
