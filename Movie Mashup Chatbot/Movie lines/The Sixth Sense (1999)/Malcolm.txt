Goodnight, sweetheart.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
I didn't leave you.
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Are you calling me?
--Do I know you?
We can keep it in the bathroom.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
And you know what else?
You were great in the play, Cole.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
I definitely won't.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
I guess she did.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
No, we're not.
Yes, I am.
Yes, it did.
Yes.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
--What?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Soon. One week.
I have to.
I don't know, Cole.
I don't know.
Yes.
Them?
Yes?
Never mind.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
What?
...No.
How often do you see them?
They don't know they're dead?
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
What makes you think that?
No gas... Hey, that's good.
No.
Yes.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
I forgot myself.
Who me?
What?
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
What kind of words?
What'd you write?
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Yeah. Sorry.
Know what?
Why?
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
You hate him?
He your best buddy?
Where should I look then, Cole?
You mean aneurysm.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
I guess they don't.
How do you draw now?
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
If it's okay with you?
No.
No.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
Dr. Crowe.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
