What?
Really?
Maybe.
Don't go home, okay?
I wish I were somewhere else.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
You do?
You believe now?
Just help.
No.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
You really look better.
What happened?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
Are you wigging out?
Something happened, didn't it?
You believe me, right?
Dr. Crowe?
You weren't a paper champion.
Don't cry.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Don't fail me.
When?
Why don't you think about it for a while?
I told you what I want.
What do you want more than anything?
Can I ask you then?
When they get mad, it gets cold.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Cats?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
Me too.
Your eyes told me.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Dr. Crowe.
Yes.
I didn't know you were funny.
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
That isn't magic.
Something I want?
Upset words.
Words.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
She died a long time ago.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
You said the "s" word.
That I'm a freak.
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
I don't tell her a thing.
He hates me.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
Look over there.
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
You want to ask me a question?
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
I'm going to see you again, right?
That's good.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
You use needles?
Congratulations.
You're a doctor. What kind?
I forgot your name.
Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
What were they hiding from?
No, just one.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
She wanted me to tell you--
I know.
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
Got it.
You think I'm a freak?
What are you thinking, Momma?
They want me to do things for them.
Ghosts.
Dead people.
They scare me too sometimes.
Standing next to my window.
Yes.
A lady. She died.
Someone got hurt.
You know that accident up there?
Tell you my secrets.
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Maybe.
Don't get mad.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Anything bad about me?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Oh.
Stuttering--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stop looking at me.
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Stop it!
I don't like people looking at me like that.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
They used to hang people here.
