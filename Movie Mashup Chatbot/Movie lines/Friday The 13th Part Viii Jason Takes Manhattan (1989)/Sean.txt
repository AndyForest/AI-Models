Jason's here in New York.
We have to get off this ship!!
This is Jason's fault!
The fire alarm...
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
It's...dead.
But I thought...
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
I've got the numbers.
Yes...
I...I don't know...
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
You have to call the police...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
But Rennie...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
Rennie...??
I didn't mean for you to go!
The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I got you a present.
I heard you weren't coming.
Rennie...
