But...wait a minute!
Time to check out the waiters.
That was truly excellent.
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...

My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.

I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.

I packed it. Just for us.
They're out of town.
Nothing.
Perfectly.
