You pushed me...
I...I can't...
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Can't we at least talk about it?
But Sean said...
I'm staying.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
She didn't push me into coming.
I'm staying.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
It's not that simple.
I can't swim.
There's something I haven't told you...
Yeah...a lot.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
I don't know what to say...
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Really?
Just felt a little chill.
What about not-so-great writers?
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Please, hurry...
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
I'm not!!
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Is the ship going to sink??
The window...
Just radio for help, okay???
Where are they?
What do you mean???
What about you?
Can he really take us home?
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
I'd love to.
But I didn't get you one...
We changed our minds.
Hi, Sean.
