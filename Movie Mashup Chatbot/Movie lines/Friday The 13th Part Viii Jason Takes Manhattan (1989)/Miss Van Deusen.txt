I don't think that's such a safe idea
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
What are you talking about?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
Did you find Rennie?
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
What are you doing??
Oh dear God...
Where is she?
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
No, I think it's just the beginning.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
Did you have an accident in the lake?
After your parents passed away?
When did this start?
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
I gathered that.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
So, are you having fun yet?
No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Everything okay?
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
