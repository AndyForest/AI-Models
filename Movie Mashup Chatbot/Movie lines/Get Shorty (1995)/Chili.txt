You're kidding me, right?
I reserved a Cadillac.
What is this?
No shit? What're some of 'em?
So... how many movies you been in?
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
Bear, you're not really gonna �-
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
What?
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
Where's Karen?
Gimme an hour.
I'll find it.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Karen? You okay?
I don't believe this.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
What money?
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
That's all there is to it, huh?
You know how to write one of these?
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
She's... young.
Get something going there.
There's Ilona.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
That's right, me.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
Harry, let me answer that.
Whatever you want, Ray.
I like it here.
Sovereign.
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Why would I do that?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
How'd you get in here?
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
Not yet. I just started.
I'm a producer.
I'm in the movie business.
That's right.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
What've you got?
Leo spanked a waitress?
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
I found him.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Here's your keys, Harry.
Hey, Harry.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Never say anything unless you have to.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
Let's see how we get along.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
He drown?
So what's the problem?
She looks familiar.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
Who's the star?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
What's it called?
For a movie?
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
Harry, look at me.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Once.
Maybe a few times I have.
Not really.
They always paid.
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
You mean, Leo?
Part of it, yeah.
The shylock's the good guy.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
That's right. As a matter of fact...
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
You just did.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
You make movies, huh?
Come on, Harry -� Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
I want you to.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
A marker's like a check, Harry.
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
Where you been, Harry?
Twenty seven hundred.
Ask your man here.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
It was in the Herald.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Yeah, he told me.
He died.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
Compass.
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
Buddy?
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
I believe it.
That's not bad.
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Martin, look at me.
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
One we're producing.
I'm thinking of a movie.
So you want to know.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
We talk different?
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
I'll find you, Leo...
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
Sit down, Leo.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
Here's another tip...
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
You've been losing.
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
I'll be right back.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
You bet.
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
You okay?
I'll go. I'll go.
I don't know.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
You sure?
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
Why not?
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
What happened?
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -�
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Oh.
You thought I was faking?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Depends, who pays?
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
Sounds fair.
There a part in it for you?
Not yet.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
What do you think?
I got you a copy of the script.
You been here the whole time?
Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
"Cotton".
Man, can you scream.
For any movie.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -� which by the way was a better book than a movie -� did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Rough day on the set?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
That's right. Three percent.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
The door from the patio, in back.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
I'm thinking about producing.
I'm going into the movie business.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
That's what the guy said.
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
