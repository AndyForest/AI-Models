He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Murray's dead.
You seem to feel fine about it.
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
I miss Murray, Harry.
What a spectacular view.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
