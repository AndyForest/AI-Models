Whatta you think, Chill?
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
What's that?
Very nice...
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Okay. I'm listening.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
How do I know that?
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
How about this?
Wait. How about this?
Like this?
I'm looking at you.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
What happened? The pressure got to you?
With what? Wiseguy money?
One of mine?
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
Yeah. That was a good party.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey ï¿½-  This your ride, Chili?
Yeah, Karen knows him.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
