I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
Get in line, bro.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
Who the fuck are you?
