You say look at you?
What?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Or else what?
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Never heard of him.
Who?
Okay. So who are you?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
What three hundred grand?
Depends. Who's this?
Who is this?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -� I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -� forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Yeah? Which terminal?
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
I don't like waiting.
He owes me money.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
