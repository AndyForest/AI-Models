C-18.
I don't know.
The airport.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Leo, I don't know.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
You serious?
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
I'm working on a few things.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people �-
It's a different kind of deal.
I can't do it.
That's correct. Look at me.
Look at me, Ray.
Ray. Look at me.
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Hello? You there?
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Ray Barboni?
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Who?
You have it?
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
Really.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
His shrink's trainer.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
I had to tell 'em something.
What?
You're kidding, right?
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
Read it. It's a grabber.
What do you get out of this?
You don't even know these guys.
Just a thought.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -�
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
One of his best parts.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -� this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer �-
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
Really? You ever been arrested?
Ever shot anybody.
What does that mean?
You pack a gun?
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
So you don't work for the casino?
But you work for the casino?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
That's it? That's your movie?
So he comes to L.A...
Keep going.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
Fuckin' basketball game.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I know what a marker is.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
That's what I'm doing.
I'm looking at you.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
Have we met? I don't recall.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
Pick 'n' Save.
She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
Yeah, but whose point of view?
How honorable of you.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
Come on in.
Hello, Doris.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
'We?'
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Oh, yeah, sure.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
That's where you got the idea?
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
I'm going.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I don't hear anything.
What's wrong?
Shylock?
What money?
Mob guy?
Which two?
