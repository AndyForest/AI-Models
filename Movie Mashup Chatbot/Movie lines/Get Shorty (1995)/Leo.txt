But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
It's all mine.
How? By taking my money?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
How'd you know I was here?
Who told you that?
I'm up twelve grand today.
They report it to the IRS.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
