Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Whatta you doing out there?
He already knew it.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
I told you not to -ï¿½
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
