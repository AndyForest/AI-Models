You're right.
We'll get it later.
And that's for the airport.
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
You get life for kidnapping.
Trade for what?
No. What's this?
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
What about him?
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
Farrah. Come here.
Come here, Farrah...
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
You see the paper?
I mean I don't care.
I guess still in the locker.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
About sixty.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
Not too bad.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
I have to ask you for that key.
You spotted them, huh?
So you didn't have the key with you.
