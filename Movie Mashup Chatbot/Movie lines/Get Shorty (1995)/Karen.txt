What took you so long?
Go get your stuff.
You don't act like it?
Were you scared up there?
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
You're as bad as Harry...
Are you going down?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Harry... My God...
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
Really.
Yeah?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
I want to know.
What do you get out of it?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Then you've read it?
I think it's not horrible.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I just caught the end.
Right. See how your story ends.
Don't go out of your way.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
You saw that one?
...That's what we finally decided.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons �-
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
What're you doing here?
How much is the wife offered?
A real bargain.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
I know what a vig is.
What if it was?
You broke in?
Harry -�
Chili and me.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
How did you get in the house?
Harry -�
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
I don't have a dog.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Be quiet and listen.
And after all, you have such morals.
Thanks.
But you are interested?
Lufkin. His... agent.
Oh, for Christ's sake �-
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Really.
Hello, Martin.
