Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
That's clear.
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
So, what are we waiting for?
It's time we lock coordinates.
10-4 good buddy.
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Barnes?
