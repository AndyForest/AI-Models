Good help is hard to find...
Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  Why do you want to kill more innocent people!  Why!
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
I don't know what you're talking about!
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
Will you transmit the distress signal?
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
You better start making sense!
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
What is the condition of the bridge?
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
Why, didn't they say?
So, are you on for the next one?
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
You're certain of that?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
Well it's a good thing that I did.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Try not to think about it.
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
It would matter to us.
That's right.  Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
And so far.
What do you mean?  What happened!
What the hell are you doing?
Over and out.
Hopefully sooner than later.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
I'm in the bridge.
Dawn.  Come in.
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
I can't!
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
I'm not going with you.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
No...
Take this flare.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
Dawn!  Dawn!
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Do you want some advice?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Yeah?
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
You're ready for the real thing?
So we did.
Are you ready?
I don't know what we're facing.
Simulated space walking.
I can't let you do that.
Everyone just stay put.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Close every door behind you!
You're right.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
Great.
Seen one like it before?
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
We don't.
I don't know.
Really?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Is it safe for human transport?
How is it looking, Mac?
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
I know but we're in a bind.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Right, I understand that...
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Mac.  What's shaking?
