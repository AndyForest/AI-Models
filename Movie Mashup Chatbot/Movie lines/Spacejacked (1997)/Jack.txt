Just don't move around too much.
Will you shut up already?
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.

Where's Taylor?
What is happening around here!!!
The engines!
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
What are you going to do about it?
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
