How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Well now what are we gonna do!
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
I guess so.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
I'm homesick.
