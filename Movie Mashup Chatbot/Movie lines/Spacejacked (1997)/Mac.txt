I did nothing to the monitors.

I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
That is one of my priorities.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Congratulations on your...recent award.
That's affirmative.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
One moment please...  one moment please...
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
