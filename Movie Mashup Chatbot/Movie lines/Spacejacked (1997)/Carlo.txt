It's getting hard to breathe...
We're going to die.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Look at this...Jesus.
