What is it?!
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
In that case, I accept.
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
Marry you?
Except write our wills.
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
So close...
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
We have room!  Let's go!
Sooner than later.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
So what's going to happen to you?
I'll do my best.
How does the distress signal look?
I'm about to blow the wall.
Barnes?
Taylor!  Where are you?
You too.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
But how are you going to escape?
And what are you going to do?!
What?  What are you talking about?
Why?  Where are you going?
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
What's that?
Oh my God.  What happened?
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
Helllp!
Words to live by.
Sure.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
What do you think's going to happen to us?
Taylor?
Explosive?
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Yeah.  We did it.
Ready as I'll ever be.
I understand.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Wait.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
He certainly is polite.
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Why can't we?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
OK...it's open.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
Just considering our options... sir.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
What are we going to do?
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
That's right.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
So I've been told.
No, just enjoying the view.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
I'm going back for Taylor!
Carlo!
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
