All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
What else?
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
Ever talk to him?
How long you been up there, Fink?
What DID you mean?
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
You two have some sick sex thing?
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Give you nose bleeds?
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Anyway.
Physician, heal thyself.
All of which he's now missin'.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
He's a little funny in the head.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
