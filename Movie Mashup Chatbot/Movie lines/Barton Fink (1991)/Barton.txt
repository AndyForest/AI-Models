I'll bet. Jesus � "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
Hah!
I want to know!
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his � what about before that?
You wrote his scripts for him?
What are they like? What are they about?
No, but the whole goddamn � Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
Well I have to come up with � an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
If you could, I'd �
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this � believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I � I'm sorry - listen, how are you � I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
What. What don't I understand?
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his �
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Really?...
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
No, no �
I see.
Please, Barton.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. �I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres � please call me Barton.
How about you? Will you be alright?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
Garland, it's me.
...Who?
...Who is this?
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
Well that's what he said.
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
I...
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
A week, eight, nine days �
I � I've got respect for � for working guys, like you �
No, I � I didn't mean to sound �
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
I write.
I need help, Audrey.
I'm sorry, I just feel like �I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
Are you all right?
What's that?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent � don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man � to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Well... actually, no Bill...
It's still a little early for me.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Well what do I tell him?
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
I didn't say anything-
I don't understand-
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
He's a great writer �
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Well not much.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started�
Well I...
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Who?
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected �
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Then who should I talk to?
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
I'm a writer. Ted O �
...Huh? No, I'm �
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the �
Sound a little what?
Yes... Isn't it?
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Not big in the sense of large � although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland � I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
No, what did it say?
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
To see pap.
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
To do what?
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
But Charlie � why me? Why �
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
You'll be back?
It's more than I've got.
Sure, Charlie.
Yeah, but Charlie �
...I just don't know what... to do�
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy � like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Jesus, Charlie, I...
Jesus... You're leaving.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
But I didn't do it � don't you believe me?
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to �
Yeah.
We gotta call the police �
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this�
You gotta believe me �
I've gotta call the police � or you could call for me �
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Charlie, I'm in trouble � something horrible's happened � I've gotta call the police...
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
No... Can I come in?
No... no...
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
What do you mean?
Well...
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
You're leaving?
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
Where there's life there's hope.
Yeah, but �
How did you know about that?
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started � I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me � my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Hi, Charlie.
It's okay, it's okay.
...Yeah, okay.
That's all right, really �
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself �
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
Yeah...
...This must be boring you.
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine � you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Nope.
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Seen a doctor?
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet � what happened to your ear?
Charlie. How are you.
See you, Charlie.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Well, we've got something in common then.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if � well I know I sometimes run on.
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man � from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and � and � and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and � well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying � a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and � and � and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life � why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York � hopefully our numbers are growing � who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths � not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
What do I write about?
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies � though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now �
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Can be. Not easy, but �
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work �
Okay... a quick one, sure...
That's all right, really, thank you.
I tried to show you something beautiful.  Something about all of US �
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Yes sir.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Yes sir, they �
Congratulations.
Mr. Lipnik.
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider �
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help �
Mr. Lipnik, I �
I � Mr. Lipnik �
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
And then... well...
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
Yeah... rye whiskey?
...Both maybe?
...Yes, thank you.
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik �
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
I'm at the Earle.
The others are being sent.
What �
Huh?
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Excuse me?
Must be.
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Charlie... Charlie's back...
What did... What did he �
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Nine days � Tuesday �
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
