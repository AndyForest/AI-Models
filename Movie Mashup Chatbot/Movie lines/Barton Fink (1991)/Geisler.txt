Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going � don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
You thought! Where'd you get THAT from?  You thought! I don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He's taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
A souse!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps � this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Wuddya got for me � what the hell happened to your face?
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Ever act?
