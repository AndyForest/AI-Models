Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN �
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
Drown all those rascals...
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity � the basest coin there is.
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
...This'll sometimes help.
Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me � lyin' and deceitful...
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
And what would that be, son?
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
So be it.
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
Just Bill, please.
I beg your pardon?
