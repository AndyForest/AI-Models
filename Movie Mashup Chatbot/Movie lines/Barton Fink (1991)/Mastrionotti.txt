You're a sick fuck, Fink.
No kidding, bright boy ï¿½ we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
Is this multiple choice?
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
L.A.P.D.
...Fred...
He teach you to do it?
Only fry you once.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
But, you know, with the head still on.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Would that be good enough for ya?
Big fuckin' deal.
What do you do, Fink?
