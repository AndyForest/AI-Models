And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Barton!
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
Before what?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Well... THIS.
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Hello, Barton.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
...Who is this?
Hello.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Let him go.
...I know this must look... funny.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary � Bill and I are... I love. We-
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks � well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational�
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
Stop it, Bill!
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Bill �
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
