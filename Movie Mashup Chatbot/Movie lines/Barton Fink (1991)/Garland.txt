Well, you just... sound a little�
Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little �
...Barton, is everything okay?
...That's fine.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that �
What do you mean, Barton?
Go ahead, son.
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Okay.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
Take my copy. You're the toast of Broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash � strike that, a lot of cash.
...Look, they love you, kid � everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism � if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night � if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
What do you do far a living?
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
