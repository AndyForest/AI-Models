Because you DON'T LISTEN!
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me � Charlie.
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime � when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you � well I do. Now don't argue with me.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on � just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
It's okay... It's okay...
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
Jesus... They can tell that...
I believe you � I KNOW you. But why should the police?
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
What do you think happened?
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Hold on �
Hold on �
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
Why don't we go to your room-
Barton. Are you all right?
Are you sure �
...Can I come in?
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
So they say.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
What a dump...
...Your room does that too?
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me � I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact � New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
A little lift, yeah...
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
I hope these are your shoes.
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Ready... wrestle!
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration �
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor � though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong � Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time �
...What's the expression � me myself and I.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back � with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
...Got a sweetheart?
I myself have yet to be lassoed.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Howdy, neighbor.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Well, I can tell you some stories �
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
And I could tell you some stories �
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Hell, I could tell you some stories�
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
...Is the egg showing or what?!
Pictures! Jesus!
What kind of scribbler are you � newspaperman did you say?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people � that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need � a fella could do worse.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game � door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
