Where is Reed?
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What did he do to the uniform?!
He didn't.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Victor did.
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
What are you doing --
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
You two need a time-out.
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
I'm driving.
Girl...?!
That's the temperature of the sun.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
I think that thing is Ben.
Stop it.
Johnny.
Apparently I can disappear.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
You need a doctor.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
I gave him twenty.
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
And reverse the mutations --
What are you doing?
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
Are you kidding?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Excuse me?
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
If it happened to him, then it could...
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
What...?  Oh.
What?
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What? What do you mean you --
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Which was?
You're happy for me and Victor.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Yes, thanks.
Great minds think alike.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
It's been changed.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
I was talking about us. Working together.
Never better.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
Please don't make this personal --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
You said it was urgent.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, your scar --
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, are you feeling alright?
You can't leave them out there.
What are you doing?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
I understand the business reasons.
It's just business.
