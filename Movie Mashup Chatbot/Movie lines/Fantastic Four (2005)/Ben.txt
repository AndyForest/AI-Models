I like the sound of that.
Those yours too?
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
I'm not really dressed for a party.
How'd you know it was me?
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Victor must've taken him.
It's easy for you to be patient.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Oh, he did.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
You look like an eighties rock band.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Is it safe?
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
And you can? Power it up?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
What do you want, Vic?
What is this? Where's Reed?
About me? How sweet.
What are you doing here?
I already got it. Everything I want.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
I'll be watching over you.
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Got it, teach.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
It's about to be a broken face.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
You got a chisel round here?
Yeah, nine years straight.
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
What the --!
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Well maybe you should date him.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Solid.
How long was I out?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Should?
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Isn't that your speech?
This makes five.
Five times.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
What about his first born?
I can't take this.
You'd never know it.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
No more cracks about how I look.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Go back to the drawing board.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Give me a mirror...
What's wrong with me?
Reed?... Sue?
Where... where am I?
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
