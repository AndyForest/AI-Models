Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Hey! That's a prototype!
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Not this again --
I though we went over this.
Me like-y.
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
So are you!
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
But all these people...
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Right, whatever, have fun.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
I can go hotter!
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
This is wrong in so many ways.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
Now what is up with that?
Ben! Ben!
What about you?
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Blockhead started it!
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Dude. That's my sister.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
Sweet.
You're really cramping my style here.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
What is that thing?
Okay, "mom."
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Please tell me you go silent too.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
