Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
You son-of�a�bitch, I'm going to kill you.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
In English, please.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
Then I guess we're even.
You son�of�a�bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
Where's my gun?
Their weapons missing?
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
I've seen worse.
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
Do me a favor �� keep sending them.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
I'm getting by.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
He was a computer program for crissake.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
How do you know I won't run?
What happens if I can't catch him?
Not from in here.
Only because I got pulled out early.
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Then shoot him already.
How's your pulse?
Where the hell are you going?
Sid?
Lindenmeyer?
...I think so...You?
Because this pain�in�the�ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
You don't know?
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Nice work.
See something?
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Part of him is.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
Both.
Authority still makes me nervous.
Real effective security...
You like baseball?
Start of what?
What's the problem?
Tell him.
You know I am.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Nothing.
This is my area of expertise.
Stop me.
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Relax. I know what you meant.
Don't worry about it, all right?
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
Sounds to me like a well�educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
What does that mean?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
She's beautiful, you know?
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son�of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
I've been in prison, remember?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
What are you doing?
Do me one favor �� if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
What happened when he was 17?
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
I know who would know.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
I don't need a baby�sitter.
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
Enough!
Go to hell.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it �� I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
John died.
A little less than yesterday.
You actually listen to all those tapes?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
What are you talking about?
Aren't you going to watch with me?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
Where did you plant the C-4?!
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Where did you plant the C-4?!
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Why's that?
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
You and me have nothing in common.
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Where's John?
