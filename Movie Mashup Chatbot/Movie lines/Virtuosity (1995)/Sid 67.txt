Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
Glad to...
How can I ever thank�you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
I am beautiful, aren't I?
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
You catching my drift?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
It was me, what?
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
Should I have?
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
I've got some final preparations to take care of�� Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his Re�Election Rally...
There you go �� best seat in the house.
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
My...secret.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you��
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common �� we have such history together ��I've been thinking we should become friends.
The symphony of collision...
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
