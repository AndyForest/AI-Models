Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
I don't know.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
Whatever.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
On my life, I promise you I will.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Fine �� you want to stay here?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
If you can catch him.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
What about them?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar �� you making it okay in there?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
You all right?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
You think he's smart?
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty�four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
