Got it.
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
I need your help--
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
I should have told him.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
What's the assignment?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
Then fix it.
Talk so I can understand.
Turn it down!
Show me his physical sensory level.
What's wrong with Parker?
What do we do now?
Duck!
I couldn't tell you.
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I don't know.
My guess is dead.
More or less.
You okay?
That's why I'm asking.
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go �� right now.  Why are you going to do this?
Can I ask you something?
Find out anything?
Thanks.
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
That, or living through him...
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
You're not capable of it.
How did you find out about the toxin?
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
We know you didn't kill those guards.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
Parker -� stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you��
Which way?
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
I'm doing the best I can!
This isn't a game, Parker!
Enjoying yourself?
What did you do to those people?
What the hell's going on?!
Don't get out of the car.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re�adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
How did you get your hand out?
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
Give me your wrist.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
As a matter of fact, it is.
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Who said that?
I am impressed.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
I'm still working on it.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better �� to improve upon what was already done.
He was re�enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
You ready for this?
You all right?
It wasn't a lie.
What you need is a collar.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
That's not true, Parker.
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
