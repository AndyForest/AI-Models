What I need is a nymphomaniac.
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
... and you get nanoï¿½death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
You're...such a wimp.
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
I haven't been working on anything.
HEY!!!
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
