You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe on�line, yet?
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
I wish we could hear them.
Why would they be going there?
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
But only you will know he's not human.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
Catch him and your record's clean.
You mean a nano�tech synthetic organism.
Why wasn't I told?
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby� trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re�assignment.
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
This better not be a wild goose chase.
You know how much man power you're talking about?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
Enough to level an entire city block.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
What did you find out?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
Think you can do it?
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
What the hell happened?
Don't remind me.
What did Cox pull him out early for?
