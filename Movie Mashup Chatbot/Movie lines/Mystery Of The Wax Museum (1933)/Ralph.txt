That's the way I feel about it.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
Well, I do say it.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancï¿½e. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
But I have some friends waiting.
To lunch.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
