What is it? What happened?
Heaven knows. A lot.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
You go in for dangerous things.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Who'd steal her body?
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
Cry-baby?
Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you!
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before --
Thanks.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
