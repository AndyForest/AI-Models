It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue!
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
No, sir. About three months ago.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
I'd know him anywhere.
What are you laughing at?
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
Shall we unpack it?
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
