I think so.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
Why didn't you eat last night?
There's no hurry. It's early.
But what about lunch?
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
You would.
I don't agree with you.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
Did you? Where?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
What are you laughing at?
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
Yes, why?
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
So that's the way it is?
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
I won't let you say that!
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
Delighted, I'm sure.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Ralph! Ralph!
Let me go! Let me go!
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
I'd love to.
But it was really my fault.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
But I think these things are beautiful.
We'll be coming to the opening.
I'd love to, at any time.
Thank you.
