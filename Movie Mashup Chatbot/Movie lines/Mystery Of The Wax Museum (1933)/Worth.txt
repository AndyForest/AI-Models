Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Yep. Everything settled.
