Afraid of lions.
Underneath.  Somewhere.
Once...
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
Since his beard was red.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Soon.
You give me hope, John.
Do you love her?
Good news?
For you.
Oh yes, I think so.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
I am also liaison between these two.
Did it look like this in your mind?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Help finish the railroad.
Where do you go next?
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Why so many?
They will want a lot of money.
How many cattle?
I don't believe you had a mother.
