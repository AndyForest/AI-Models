-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
As are they all.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-

You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
