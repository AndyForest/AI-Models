Are you serious?
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?

If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
You look -- nice.
I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
Well, yeah, but --
I didn't mean --
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Now I am.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.

I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.

That's why I think it's time for us to --
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
You're beautiful.
