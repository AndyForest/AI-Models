You're fired. I have new representation.
Get up.
Are we done for today?
Go to hell.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
I loved him!
Why would I kill my husband?
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
I can't tell you.
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
Is he always such an ass?
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
What's going on?
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
It's so shameful...
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
