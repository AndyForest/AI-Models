Who?
What?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
I believe we are.
I'll take that as a no.
Were you with another man?
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
What alibi?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
I do. I'm not allowing it.
You're not going up there.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
About the alibi --
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Sit down.
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
What are you talking about?
Why the hell not?
Did you get it?
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Was she carrying a weapon?
What did you see when you entered the house?
