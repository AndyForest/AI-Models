Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Josh proposed!
Picking out my wedding dress!
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
Here. You're gonna need this.
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Pull up next to him!
Yeah, luckily.
Why?!
Let's all go! Road trip!
Cunnilingus?
You're right. Phew!
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
It's not a Theta --
Elle?
