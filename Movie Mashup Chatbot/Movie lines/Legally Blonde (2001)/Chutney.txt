His dead body with a bullet in it.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
No.
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Because they got wet.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Yes.
Yes.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
I guess.
No. I was in the shower.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
