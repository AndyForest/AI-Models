What are you talking about?
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
I missed you, Lieutenant.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
Is that what you "heard"?
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
I understand.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
