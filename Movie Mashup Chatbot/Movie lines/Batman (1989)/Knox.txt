Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
The small one.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
How high up would you say that is?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
Great.  Give me a grant.
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Holy shit. Holy...
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
HOLY SHIT!!
Great. How??
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Not what?
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
What were you thinking?
Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Holy shit...
Where does one man get all this junk?
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
