If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
Where's the boy?
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
Do you want a drink?
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
What is it you want?
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
Got it!
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Finding out where she is.
Keep her on the line!
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
I feel naked without it.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
No one would miss me.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
... Looks like a convention.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
I don't sing very well.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
What did you see?
Odd desire for anyone.
No.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
