... Murderer...
What are you talking about?
Take me. Let the boy go.
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
Is this what you wanted?
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Thank you, Vicki.
I'll take you with me.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
Please.
I'll have to ask you for that film.
...Not even a 'thank you'?
How much do you weigh?
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
I know. I called them.
GET IN THE CAR!!
