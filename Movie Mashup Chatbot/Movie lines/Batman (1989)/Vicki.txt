You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
What is that?
I loathe bats.
How'd you find this place?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
... How long have I been out?
... Where are you taking me?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
I won't let you have it.
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
Well -- I think you might consider
... A hundred and eight?
Can't we --
What about the girl?
Shouldn't we --
Look! Police!
WHICH CAR?
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
What now?
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
... Where are you calling from?
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
I wish you'd...
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
All street mimes should be executed.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
... We could try that.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
... Terror.
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Do you sail?
As far as I know.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
... Why the mask?
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
And you want a --
... Thank you.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
You okay?
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
Yeah. Deja vu.
It's gone.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
He's not crazy.
Allie, he's not.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Alexander... I know you.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Are they paying you for all this?
You are on drugs.
Oh, Bruce...
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Peanuts?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Yum, yum.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
No.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
How'd you know it was me?
