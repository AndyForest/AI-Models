I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
D'Artagnan.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
Nothing... Nothing.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
No, stay back!  Stay back!
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
That is good.
And you were not hurt?
I understand you saved my son's life today.
No, Louis!  No!
He is your brother!
Louis, please -- !
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
I wish to discuss your brother.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
