What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
