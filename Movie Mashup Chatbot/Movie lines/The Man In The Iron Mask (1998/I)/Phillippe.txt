All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
How did you --
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Whose rooms are those?
Porthos told me.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
What is that?
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
What is its antidote?
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
I am unhurt --
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
... The ball... Continue.
Continue.
