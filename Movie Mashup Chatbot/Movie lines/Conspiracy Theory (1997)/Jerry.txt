Look, I'm sorry --
I was only going one way.
The guy came right at us!
I, uh, I have some problems.
I never told her.
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
That's love.
The sound of love.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Mississippi?
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Now she tells me.
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Top pocket...  Go on.
I can't promise you anything.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.  <u>Now</u>.
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
Liza?
Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
Blue moon...
Blue moon... Blue moon...
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
They'll trace it.
You do?
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
Because he believed me.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Where were you the day he died?
He gave it to me.
Is that what they told you?
Liza?
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Come on.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
Connecticut.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
This way.
Not today.
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
You look great.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
You will?
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
Right here in Manhattan.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Did you see the van back there?
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
He's why you punish yourself.
How'd he die?
Is he dead?
Is this your dad?
So what's the question?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
Shoot.
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Never, but I've been practicing.
Uh huh.
Getting rid of my hub!
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Never heard of him.
Who?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Pretty scary, huh?
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
I've been reading up on it.
If my universe had a hub...
You want something to drink?
The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
I have no idea.
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
Yeah.  I think so.
Six months.  Eleven days.
Nothing is easy.
I noticed.
Yes.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
Figure of speech.  Could we go?
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Arf... You gotta help me.
You saved my life.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
Really?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
Love.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
Switch the charts.
What's the charge?
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
What was your horse's name?
I better get going.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
You think I'm crazy.
You going to warn him?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Do you still ride?
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You've never seen her run.
<u>Liza</u>!
What's that?
Could you be a little more specific?
That's great.  Good for you.
Do I know you?
Whatever.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
I'm leaning toward no.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
You're here because you figured I might show up.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
Thank you.
