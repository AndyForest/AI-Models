Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
I don't know...
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
You made your decision yet?
Well, I don't know if --
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
I'm not sure what you mean.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
That you come with me.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
What gave me away?
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
What do you mean?
Yeah, I do.
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Your call.  Have a good night.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Wasn't my idea.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
Which way did he go?
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
