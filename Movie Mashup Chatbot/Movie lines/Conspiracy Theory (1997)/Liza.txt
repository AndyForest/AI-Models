Any special reason?
Who?
What happened?
I love you, too.
You think it's a conspiracy?
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
Don't do this.
Geronimo is down.
What about you?
How did you know?
Where are you?
You knew just what I was there for.
Without a love of my own.
You saw me standing alone ...
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
I'm sorry.
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
I believe you.
How'd you get the picture?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
Why not?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
Back where?
Love at first sight?
Then tell me what happened.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Did you kill my father?!
At a horse show.
I don't understand.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Did you kill my father?
Did you kill him?
You go.  Send me a postcard.
My father's house.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
What about them?
What's in Connecticut?
Where are we going, Jerry?
Now what?
We're going to Queens?
What is it?
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Thanks.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
Jerry, I --
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
What?
If that's what you want.  Yes.
Okay, I will.
A water main broke.
They're big details, Jerry.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
Where then?
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Murdered?
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Realized what?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
What van?
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
You watch me, don't you?
Not this again.
He was murdered.
Please put it down.
That was him.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
How is it possible?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
Who are you, Jerry?
Has this happened to you before?
Was that who I thought it was?
What are you doing?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
You got a list?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Can you prove any of this?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Are these yours?
Equitation.
This would be it?
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Surprise me.
You okay?
Believe you about what?
You're certifiable.
What newsletter?
So why are they after you?
That's it?
Do they have a secret handshake?
What is it with you and the space program?
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
As opposed to?
Yeah.
Them who?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
I can't promise you anything.
He says a dog bit his nose.
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
For what?
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
People do have heart attacks.
What is?
I'll see you tomorrow.
What?
Just relax.
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
You bit someone's nose off?
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
No.
I think you're different.
I can't promise you anything.
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
Motive?
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
Not for years.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
I don't see the connection.
It's okay.  I'm game.
I don't understand.
You sound so sure.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Where'd you get it?
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
I don't believe you.
I'm still listening.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
A dog.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Terminal?
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
Excuse me?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
You've asked me that one three times.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
And you feel bad for it?
Excuse me?
Can I ask you something?
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Working.
Working.
Agent Lowry?
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
-- Understood.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
This doesn't make sense.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Not today...
I don't think so.
What do you suggest?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Where do you think Jerry is?
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
And Jonas?
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
I want to believe you, too.
Do you believe me?
Can I talk to you a second?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Jonas?
Agent Lowry.
No.  Not yet.
I was just thinking that.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
You don't understand --
Wait --
Tell me about it.
