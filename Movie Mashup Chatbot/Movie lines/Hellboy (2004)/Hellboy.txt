Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
I'm lucky that way.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
We don't take hints.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Don't get psychic with me.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
See? I don't like that --
That's all for you, Sammy.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
Is it bad?
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Me?? C'mon --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Reliquary --
Who wards off demons.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
I don't want him.
Got tired of me?
Who's the squirt?
I can live with that.
Anung-un-Rama...
Noooo! Noooo!!!
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
That voice --
My job.
Yup.
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
No. Don't --
Don't move. We --
I won't take 'em. They never work.
Those things never work. Never.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
I wish I could be more gracious but --
What are you trying to say?
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
I knew those men better than you did --
How big can it be?
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Good night.
Not from you.
Not hungry.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Shh! Just a second.
What was that??
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
Hey. You: think twice --
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
What took you so long?
Goodbye.
Myers?
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Myers??? How's your arm?
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Whatcha looking at, John??
Father's back?  Still angry?
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
...Polo.
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Good.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Hi.
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
You're going alone?
Out? Out out?
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Goodnight, then.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
