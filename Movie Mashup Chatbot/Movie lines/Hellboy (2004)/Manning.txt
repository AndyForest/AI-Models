Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Is he serious??
See what??
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
Thank you.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
You call that thing a cigar??
I'm in charge. We go back!
-- should go back. Now!
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Each of us gets a belt.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
