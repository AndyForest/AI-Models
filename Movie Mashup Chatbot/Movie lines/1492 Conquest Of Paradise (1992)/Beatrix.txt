What is it, now?  Tell me...
I am busy inside.
They took everything...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
You don't usually ask.
That's something you can't decide.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Thank God...
I find that hard to believe.
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I know.
