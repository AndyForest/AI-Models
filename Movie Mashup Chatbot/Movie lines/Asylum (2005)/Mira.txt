Subtitles) You have made many mistakes Pavel, let there be no more, for your sake.
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
Have you lost all control of this city?
So, who is in the building?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
What are you an idiot!
You are responsible...What has happened?
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
You are quite sure it's secure?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
Why are there still such headlines?
