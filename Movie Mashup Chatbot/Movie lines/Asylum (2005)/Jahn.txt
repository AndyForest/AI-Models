About forty minutes.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.

I'll do my best. Is the place open.

Hi, want to take up dancing?
Sure, I've done it easily.

Yeah, for sure.
