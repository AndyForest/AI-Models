Insurance!
And take Jiri with you?
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
How?
Ah, so what?
