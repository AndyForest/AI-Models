I insist, it is the least we can do.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
Would you like your things now?
You may use my office.
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
I'm not sure it's possible.
What is it you want?
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
Really!
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Enjoying our hospitality?
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Why did you break into that particular building?
You will wish you hadn't.
And you broke into that room?
This is your doing?
Very well.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
And what of these foreigners?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
Some Americans?
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
We're not sure...
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
