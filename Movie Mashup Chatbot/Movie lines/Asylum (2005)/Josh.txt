Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
Shall I look after the rest?
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
It's more than what you're worth.
That's my bag.
Come on Holly!
It's time to go home, Holly.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
I think we should be going honey.
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Well come on, sit down.
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
When the hell did you write that?
