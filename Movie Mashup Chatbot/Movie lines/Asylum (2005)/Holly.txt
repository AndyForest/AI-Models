Doug?
It's that one isn't it.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
That one?
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
No, by road?
Do you know the way?
You're sure?
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
I made a deal with Josh.
You don't understand, I can't!
I can't go with him.
Yeah, no problem.
I'm not hungry, really.
It's Josh's.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
Cool!
Why don't we both forget about him?
Better than you.
Yeah, but it was okay.
Uh-huh!
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Who you saving the dishes for?
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
I'd better get you to a hospital.
No, just a coffee.
Is it dry?
Shall I wash these out?
We_re not all running away
A champion of lost causes huh?
I figured you more as a Socialist?
What's the Bugler?
Why are you doing all this, what for?
Seems a shame!
Thanks.
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
I thought I'd help out.
Am I invited?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
Yes, if you can get him free.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
Can we talk in your office?
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
You bastard!
Go to hell!
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
I don't want to go.
Why?
What for?
Later.
Josh!
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Maybe it is!
Just yesterday.
