No!
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
No I wasn't.
Who is she Daddy?
You know her?
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
It was a she.
I thought you'd be pleased.
You are upset.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Not much further.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
A little.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
What do you mean?
What's wrong?
I will. Is that all?
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
It won't happen again.
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
Daddy you scared me!
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
You're the killed.
Yes.
_ Your father raped someone?
What do you know about my father?
Me? Why me?
Really?
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Of course I'm scared.
You know about that too?
Sure.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
I am.
I can't right now.
Stag?
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
I won't.
Ok.
No.
What party?
What?
FINE. Are you?
Someone tried to kill me.
NO?!
Not that many.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
He says he loves me.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Does she fuck?
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
You eventually have to talk to him.
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
Mark Shale.
Go sit next to him.
No.
You Miss Dunlop?
Don't you think it's sick?
You heard about that?
This place is empty.
Twenty eight years ago.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
What are you doing?
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
Thanks for coming back for me.
Go to the police station!
My dad's down there!
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
What?
This party is sick.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
I'm making you feel like meat?
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I'll think about it.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
I do not.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Did Sharon say no?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
I did.
I'm fine.
What?
I got to get home.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Cut it out.
NO!
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Who was the fourth?
The principal?
You're not telling me something.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Who were they?
The word is Mob.
How could you?
And the police did nothing?
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
Why not?
You didn't believe her?
Attacked how?
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
Wait.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Who is she?
The library. I'll be fine.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
That's what he said.
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
Yeah. Who is she?
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
I need to ask you something.
Mom?
Hi mom.
His mother's an only child.
On what side of the family?
Kenny's aunt?
Yeah.
Yes?
