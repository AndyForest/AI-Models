You're not?
Daddy....

Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Especially not your dad.
You can't tell your parents.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Mark invited me to the party.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
You ok?
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
OK. increase the peace.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
No!
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Oh nice save.
I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
No! That's his table.
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
Why?
Who?
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
So are you.
No, you keep one.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
And she didn't?
