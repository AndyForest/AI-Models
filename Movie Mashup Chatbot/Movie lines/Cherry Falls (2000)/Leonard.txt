Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
I'm sure you should have failed.
What?
Pay no attention to me.
You think you're my sister?
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
I really do. For your own safety.
Then you should go.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
You aren't going to the party?
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
