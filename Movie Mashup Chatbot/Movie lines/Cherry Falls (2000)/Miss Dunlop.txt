You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Follow me.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
