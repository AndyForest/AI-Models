This will relax her.
Did you warn her?
Well?
She just turned off her light.
What happened?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
Yes.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
Two men left town right after it happened.
Who?
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
What?
Don't make me order you.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
Where are you going?
Not that I know of.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Did he say anything else about her?
What?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Lisa Sherman?
You can ask me anything.
Yes?
Hi princess.
