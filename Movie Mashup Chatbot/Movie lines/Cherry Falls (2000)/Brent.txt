I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
is there anything you do?
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
She's my daughter, Tom.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
No.
Run!
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
What did you hear?
You were eavesdropping.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
It can't be.
Are you sure?
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
I'm not.
No honey.
Ok.
You never went, uh, all the way?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
How much further?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
Hi honey.
I want you to head right home after school.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
Hi honey.
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
You said that two weeks ago.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
You're grounded Friday night!
It's almost ten o'clock.
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Are you sure?
No?
No. I'll handle this.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
She's underage.
What are you doing?
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
She's still a virgin.
Is Jody still awake?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
Why?
Really?
No, you couldn't.
No.
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Can you get inside?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
She was murdered?
Of what?
She works at a church?
You know where I can find her?
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
