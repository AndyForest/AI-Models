Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
That obvious, huh?

Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
