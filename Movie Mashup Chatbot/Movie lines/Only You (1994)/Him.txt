Let's face it.  You want me.
So, what are we waiting for?
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Mommy, this is Faith.
Faith, this is my mother.
So what do you think?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
And more...
Really...
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Wait.
I'll look forward to it.
Sure.
Well, not exactly...
Tonight?
Just since yesterday.
Sure is.
Hello.
Uh huh.
