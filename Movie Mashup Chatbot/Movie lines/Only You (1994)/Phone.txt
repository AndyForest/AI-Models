Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
My name's
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
Who's this?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
