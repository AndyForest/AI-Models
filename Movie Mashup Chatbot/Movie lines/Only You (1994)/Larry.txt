What great aunt?
Who's dying?
Exactly.
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
But Faith--
But, Faith--
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
No.
Okaaaaayyyy.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
She didn't give me a chance.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
Yeah--
I came after the woman I love.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
You used to love it when I called you doll.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
