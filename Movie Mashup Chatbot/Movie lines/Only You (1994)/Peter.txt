I was hoping for the real thing.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Really?...
Very funny.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
What would you call it?
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
There's no such thing.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
Is something the matter?
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
In that case... no...
Are you asking me out?
Well.  Congratulations.
You aren't?
I know the feeling.
No.  Are you're leaving?
Hi.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
I'm sorry.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
You okay?
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
We were hungry.
What?...
Nice dress.
Hey--
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?
And she's a knock-out, too.
Yeah.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
So.  You found him.
Hi.
Do you want me to do it?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
He's out by the pool right now.
Or Hustler.
Mickey Spillane.
I'd really rather not say.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Because.  I know where he is.
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Because I don't have the right name?!
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
So?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
You didn't answer my question.
Does he love you?
He's safe.
To the foot doctor.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Why can't you just tell me?
You are leaving, aren't you?
Are you okay?  You want some help?
You're limping.
I'm in love with you.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
Thanks.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
Where is she?
I have to talk to her.
