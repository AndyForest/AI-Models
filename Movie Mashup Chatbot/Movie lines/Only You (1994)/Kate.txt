Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
Of course not.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
No.
No.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
What about Larry?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
Oh.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Uh huh.
So...
When you could've found one in America.
Yup.
Yes.  He is.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
And he is living proof.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Whatareyoudoing?!
Joan Collins stayed here.
Amazing...
Peter found him?
I'll be back before you leave.
You sure you'll be okay?
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
Who said I was going?
What about Peter?...
...and a fortune teller.
I know, but...
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Why?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Hi-iii...
Men have ways.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
That was really sweet...
And then what, Faith?
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Good luck.
Faith--
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Nope.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
I never even got to be single.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
What's she saying?
What did you say to her?
Her brother.
Polo.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
That was a long time ago.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
You think he misses me at all?
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
What's that supposed to mean?...
I'm hungry.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
Your brother?
Only what?
What is it?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
What'd you find?
So?
I just got a dial tone--
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
What are you doing?
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
You okay?
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
Live happily ever after.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
My God, you have...
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Does Dwayne know about this?
Because you were afraid to fly.
You don't have a passport.
What about your job?
But it's July.
It's a coincidence.
No...  I can just tell.
I think he's having an affair.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
But what?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Come on, it's not so bad.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
Why don't you ask him?
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
You don't have any idea?
What's he do?
So?...
Is he gay?
Is he married?
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
So, what's your point?
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Oh.
How about that guy at the bank?
How about the other one?  His friend.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
That's exactly what you are.
Giovanni.
But I do want to.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
How old are you?
Oh.
I'd love to.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
A porco?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Kate.
And you didn't tell her?
She what?!
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
He missed me.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Went to high school with him. But...
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
What?  You know him?
You said it differently then.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
No.
Right.
No, why?
You miss me?...
Sorry...
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Ten billion to one.
That's really romantic.
Mania.
Good strategy.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
She's not here.
