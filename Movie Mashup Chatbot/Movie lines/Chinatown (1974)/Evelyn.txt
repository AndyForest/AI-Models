Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Well yes.
A private investigator?
Yes.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Certainly not!
No.
No.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Of course.
I'm all right.
He didn't wear bifocals.
Okay...
With us.
Where can we go?
I have to go home and get my things.
How about a plane?
Back to Mexico.
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
She's my sister and my daughter!
She's my sister.
She's my daughter.
Katherine.
...no...
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
What are you saying?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
What the hell is this all about?
No...
What did you do that for?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
Upstairs. Why?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Did you get some sleep?
...That's not what I meant.
Aren't you coming back with me?
I can't...
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
You're insane.
What does it look like?
Yes.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
She's too upset.
I am not!
She's not tied up!
The police?
You bastard.
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
It's possible.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
Do? To who?
What did he say?  What did he say?
You didn't tell me.
You saw my fa... father? When?
He owns it. You know?
It has to do with my father.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Just... I have to.
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
What about it?
What's wrong?
Could you do anything about it?
...No. Why was it.
Hold still. Why?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Doing what?
What were you doing there?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
When was the last time?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
I gave everybody the night off.
Why?
I'll stay.
They can't be.
Is that unusual?
What? What is it?
And Hollis knew about it?
No, I think I'd remember.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
No.
The Valley?
What dam?
What are you thinking?
Of course I'm sure.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Oh.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Another satisfied client?
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
How did it happen?
I don't believe you.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Yes... why?
K... Cross.
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
I mean I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
Mr. Gittes.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Unless what?
Why?
I was grateful.
My husband.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
But he wasn't killed.
It wasn't much of a lie.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
I have?
Well, how much would you like?
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Oh... thank you.
...Just a minute...
Please call first.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
No. I went riding rather early.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
What do you mean?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
I said I'll drop it.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
That's not his apartment.
My husband's at the office.
Iced tea.
Would you like something to drink?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
