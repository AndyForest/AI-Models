An honest living.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact � it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
Look at that.
The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Can I check one of these volumes out?
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Then these are all new owners?
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
I'll settle for L.A. County.
Who do you blame for that? Her?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
How much are you worth?
How do you do that?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Haven't the faintest idea.
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
With her mother.
She's fine.
I've got her.
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
How did you find out?
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
What about her?
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
When was the last time?
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Maybe.
No. She's probably scared to death.
Yeah.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
His girlfriend?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
What for?
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Too bad?
None.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Very.
We worked in Chinatown together.
Oh yes.
Lou Escobar � he's a Lieutenant.
They're calling it an accident.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
I think I gave it to her.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
Probably.
It doesn't hurt.
Thanks.
Always?
Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
Sir?
Just bring your checkbook.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
I'll throw that in too.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Tell her later.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Where's that?
Curly, where's your car?
No thanks.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Oh they don't?
What's that, Curly?
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
That's a filthy habit.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
But what?
How do they do that?
The apple core?
Where did you get this material?
That's just lovely.
Well you own a lot of land.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
I've been wanting to meet you.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
An accident?
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
I guess not.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
Yeah.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
What for?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Matter of fact I do.
I know what he says.
They only dump the water at night.
It's too late.
C'mon I'll show you.
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
You accusing me of extortion?
I heard it was an accident.
Yeah?
What pictures?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I don't.
Didn't you call?
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
No?
No.
No.
I'd like to talk to him.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Looking for someone.
Congratulations.
Since when?
I get by.
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
Thanks, Lou.
Summer colds are the worst.
How are you, Lou?
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
Let me handle that.
How do you know?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
...where does Kyo live?
I'll take care of it.
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
...so that's why you hate him...
To Mexico...
I said I want the truth.
I said the truth!
Katherine?... Katherine who?
That's good. Now what's her name?
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
Going somewhere?
I want to see her.
Where's the girl?
Sure.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
I will if you don't.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
You mean she just found out?
What about?
Then let's go talk to her.
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
Okay, give me the keys.
Including the death of your husband?
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
Give me an example.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
There hasn't been a lot of time.
This morning.
I saw him.
I know.
The Albacore Club.
Where are you going?
And I want to know where.
Where?
...A flaw...
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Your eye.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
Yeah.
They do in Chinatown.
As little as possible.
Working for the District Attorney.
It was in Chinatown.
Why?
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Maid's night off?
Get in the car.
They may not know it but they are.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
We got it. We got it, baby.
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
Know him?
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
That dam is a con job.
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
You sure shout that?
Never forgave him for what?
Oh, yeah?
Then it was over the water department.
Over the water department, or over you?
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
So you married your father's business partner?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Another satisfied client's wife.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
No, not for that one.
No. I'm just a snoop.
No reason.
That your maiden name?
For very long?
You were seeing someone, too.
You mean you don't know where you were?
Where you were when your husband died.
Did he know?
Did you have affairs?
She's cheating on him.
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
He told you?
How did you find out?
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
I got your check in the mall.
A check?
You left your keys in the ignition.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
I'll stop by.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
I should talk this over with your husband.
I don't want to drop it.
Mrs. Mulwray?
What?
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
What are you having?
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
Not that Mulwray?
Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me � so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
Sophie.
Sophie.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Walsh here?
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Where'd he go yesterday?
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
The obituary column?
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
When did you come in?
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Okay.
Don't know her. Take a number.
Who?
Yeah, Sophie.
We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
There's just one question.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
You're a married man, am I right?
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
I never was.
Only when I breathe.
I cut myself shaving.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Well, tell him I'll be back.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
And Mulwray isn't?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Never.
Well, no.
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Yes?
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
What about the water?
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
It's bone dry, Morty.
The L.A. River?
Come again?
Yeah.
So how are you, Morty?
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
Yeah?... I do?
Who?
Yeah.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
Water and Power?
All right, what's your husband's first name?
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
Then go home and forget about it.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
I am sorry.
No, really?
Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Yeah, I'll do that.
Yeah.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
They were partners.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
How did they get it away from him?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
He owned the water department?
He did or he didn't?
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Gittes.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Apple core?
What about?
This?
Neither do I.
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
What's that, pal?
You don't say?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
Why'd she run away?
Well, you never know, do you?
She ran away?
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
I'm working for his daughter.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Not exactly.
