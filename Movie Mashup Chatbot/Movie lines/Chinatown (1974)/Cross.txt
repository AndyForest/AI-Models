The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Oh, my, yes.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
What does this mean?
Yes... I think I can manage...
What is it?
Where is she?
Is she all right?
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
Avocado groves?
Just find the girl.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
My daughter.
At my age, you tend to lose track...
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
No.
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
Yes, his girlfriend.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Was he right?
Why is that funny?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
That's too bad.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
Honest?
Would you call him a capable man?
Where from?
Do you know him?
Who's the investigating officer?
Tell me. What do the police say?
How did she get that idea?
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
