Yes...
Yes...
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
I said, the northwest valley.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.

Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
I don't understand.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Help yourself.
I'm sorry, I --
He never even kids about it.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
