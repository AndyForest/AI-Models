Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.

No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.

Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
But that's what you told your wife.
