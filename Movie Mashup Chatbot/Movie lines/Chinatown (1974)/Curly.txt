You sure this is okay?
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Plus what I owe you?
I don't know...
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
I'll just tell my wife.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Off the alley.
In the garage.
Sure thing.
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
...No...
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
They don't kill a guy for that.
I think I'll kill her.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Ain't worth thinking about.
She's just no good.
