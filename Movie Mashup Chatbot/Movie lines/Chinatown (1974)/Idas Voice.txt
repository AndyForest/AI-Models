Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
