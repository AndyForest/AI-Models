How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
We aren't completely stupid.
So you noticed too?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
79 kilos.
What the hell's it matter?
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
Smoke screen for what?
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
I never said I was.
I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
That's what I said.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
Let's wait on the power cells.
Wha'?
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
25 kilos each, huh?
How many?
Little ratty-ass.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
Well, don't ask me to.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
I assume he licked it clean.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
Like my pistola.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Shut up.
Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
Didn't bite.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Probably right.
Tell me it's not a mirage.
Which means he went toward sunrise.
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Only around humans.
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Big Evil?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
Hey, who?
Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
I'm born-again.
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Very big beads.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
What the hell are these?
A toast to whatever he just said.
King Tut's tomb....
...then we saw this.
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What do you care?
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
What if you're one of five?
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Such as.
Well, what's it look like now?
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
I'd rather piss glass.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
