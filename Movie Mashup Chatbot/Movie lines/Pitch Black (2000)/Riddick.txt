Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Don't wanna miss this.
You barely know them.
You'd die for them?
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
Just give me your hand.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
They're already dead. Get on board.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
We can't make it.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
As fast as you can.
As fast as you can.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
One or two.
So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
Back to the ship, huh?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
<u>Listen</u>.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Saw something I didn't like.
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Had it with deals.
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Power cells.
Look deeper.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
'Mean the whispers?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
You <u>don't</u> see.
And pointless.
What're you doin'?
Which half?
There is no "safe."
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
What's her name, anyway?
So which one caught your eye?
Nice embellishment.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Not if I'm the one.
Just realized that, huh?
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
No. She's not.
About the girl.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
Looks clear.
Said "looks clear."
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Think about that reward, Johns.
Well, you got the big gauge.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Say that again.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
What, it's broken?
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
