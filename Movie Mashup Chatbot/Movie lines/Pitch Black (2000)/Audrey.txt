Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
You came for us....
What? What is it?
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Lookit. Lookit!
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
<u>What</u>?
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
