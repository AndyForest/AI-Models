A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
Great.  Big ears, too?
Help me here...
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
No.  I think it's ugly.
You think this is funny?
That doesn't bother me.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Honey, she won't d...
That's so weak.
She still packing for her trip?
See, I...
Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.
Hold lunch!
The timing was off -- I need this light.
This is my house too!
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
Thank God for that!
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
Here.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
That's nice Ben.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Alright starve.
Then have a donut --
Fine.
Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
And when did that pass?
You say that like I don't know that.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
Which part of no don't you understand?
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
You ride with Annabelle...
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
Ben never mentioned it.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
You're lying.
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
Double.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
Oh please.
You weren't passing 'em out.
That's not wh...
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
Worked.  Like a charm.
Aw.
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Give 'em my number.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Don't be too sure.
Are we.
Looks nice enough to m...
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
And her...?
My advice to you?  Don't die.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
It's the same choice you made.
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It's just not the right time t...
No.
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
And you said...
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
Brad Kovitsky.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
So.  Hopeful.
Can I look at the pictures?
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
See, I know that.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
I don't, but...
You bet you are.
You're not dying.
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
...it's my problem, too.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
We can't live like that.
But I came here to...
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Look, you've never liked me...
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
You feeling all right?
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
Jackie?
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
I'm sorry, I just...
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Not personally.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
I did it for her.
I need practice.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
I have a snoop.
I don't recall inviting you.
...in.
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Yeh?
Look, I...
But it's not on the schedule!
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
I was in there in him.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
<u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
I'm gonna get me a drink.
How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Because you've changed so much.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
No problem.
I know that.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
It's just an assignment.
It's no biggie.
What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
I think so too...
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Look.  I know they hate me.
I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.
But?  But what?
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
For what?
Jesus.
So I'll have to order in?
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
