She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
Ben!  What's wrong?
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I'll miss you so much.
Yes.
Until he's old enough to read.
I'm not.
I don't want to say goodbye.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
Mom?  What's wrong?
Maybe twenty.
This'll work, huh?
This is a joke, right?
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Not with my mouth open.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
Great.
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
I said...
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
And don't tell her I told you.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
She knows every neat junk food place.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
Wow.  Who's that for?
I'll be there for you.
Like how?
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Or blush.  You look pale.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
What are you gonna talk about?
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
Because it feels really incredibly good.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
I live.  In the same country.
During sex.
Why does Rachel scream?
Sex.  Of course.
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
I'm gonna call him.
Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
It just slipped out.
Like who?
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Mass hysteria.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
I hate when you say that.
I don't care.
But Rache...
In high school.
Uh.  What is it?
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
Not use my words, please!
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
You think this is funny?
That doesn't bother me.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Why don't you say hello?
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
MOMMY!
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
What if he's kidnapped?
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
And this is my room so get out!
This is my daddy's house --
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
You lost Ben?!
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
Cos she loves you.
There's worse things.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
You owe me a quarter.
No they're not.
Don't take my picture!
I hate her.  I really hate her.
Ice cold water.
