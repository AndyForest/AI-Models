Good.  That's very good.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
Let me be the judge of that.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Don't. Take me with you.
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
Nothing sweetheart.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Oh, yeh.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
You have to ignore him.
And what do you do wh...
Good girl.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
You don't like his friends.
Actually.  I could only help him.
I could help with the debate.
What's Thursd...
She is but an arriviste.
And...?
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
I can't hear you.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
Secret's safe with me.
I bet.
Like a big sister.
I hope it's the right kind.
Well.  It's for you.
That happens.  To families.
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
Look she's upset --
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
So why are you asking me?
...why do you think?
How would you know sh...
Scream.
Well, not exactly s...
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
That will never happen.
It happens.
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Excellent point.
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
Half.  Of him.
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Find the bird cage?
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
Okay.  These are good.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Where Ben?
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Mommy's sick, guys.
Pray.  We never find out.
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Thursday's fine...
I'm fine, ba...
That I do.  Always will.
Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
What honey?
Yes...if you like big hair...
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
That's necessary, huh?
So we'll...radiate some more?
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
I live or I die.
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
It's temporary.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
And we all went through that together?
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
WE are over.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
To make it easier for them or you?
Just not to me.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
And I'm supposed to care.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
Called him.  We set an ap...
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Not to me.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Easy enough.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
I'm worried.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
We're not discussing your age.
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Something's up wi...
Because you don't really seem here.
Are you here?
Remarried.  There is no move.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
I have their past.
You'll learn.
You're the hip and fresh.
What do I have that you don't?
Why didn't I?
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
I lost him.  I was panicked.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
No, there isn't.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
Thanks for coming out.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
And I'm going to win.
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
Is that what he told you?
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
Feeling the pressure?
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
You mean, after I'm dead?
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
Thanks, but it's under control.
How's she doing with Brad?
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
I really look like shit.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
And you said...?
She's devastated.
Oh, my God.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Moi?
She hasn't mentioned this.
You're a cross-dresser.
Small world.
Ironic, huh?
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
How the hell would you know?
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
Did I hear the word...
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
Nobody likes a snoop.
Don't flatter yourself.
You WHAT?
My boss.
I don't know wh...
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Yes?
She was angry at herself.
Anxiety.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Fine, forget it.
However many.  It's not enough.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
So why did y...
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
Machines do not EAT message.
You got to hell!
Get out!
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
What did you do?
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
We don't have any coffee.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
