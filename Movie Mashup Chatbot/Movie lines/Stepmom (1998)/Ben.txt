I'd rather be with Mommy.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
I killed her!
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
IS THAT YOU?
Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
Dad!  You can talk him into anything!
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
I made you some cocoa.  See?
Excuse me --
No!
But you told us to starve.
No.
You touched it.
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
No.
It's not good enough.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
So where are you?
But you can still see him.
You dying.
Rache says it's from you.
Rache can do that part.
I helped.
Oh.
How do you know?
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
Before you.
No!  I have to get there.
That's Rache's song!
So you're okay.
Is your bad?
You have the WORST flu since...
No.
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Mom...?
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Yes.
Where are you, anyway?
Is that like Luigi's?
And many meatballs.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
If you want me to hate her I will.
Mommy?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
Rachel's job is she works.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
I knew where I was all the time.
Poof!  You're happy now.
Queen of diamonds.
I have lava.
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
