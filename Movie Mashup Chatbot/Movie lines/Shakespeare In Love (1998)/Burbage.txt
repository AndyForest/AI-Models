Treachery!
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
Never!
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Wait!  Will you desist!
Tomorrow.
You have the last act?
What do you want, Kit?
We will all be put in the clink.
No Juliet?!
Ask him.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Ned is wrong for it.
You're a liar.
How much?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
The title?
What is the chief part?
Are you writing?
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
