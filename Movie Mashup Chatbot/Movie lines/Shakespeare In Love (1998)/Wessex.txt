Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
I will.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
Not ready? Where is she?
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Two hours at prayer!
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty
I like her.
Is she obedient?
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
Lady Viola isï¿½young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
My lady VIOLA.
I have spoken with your father.
My lady Viola.
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
That dog!
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Is there a man?
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
"Poet?"
