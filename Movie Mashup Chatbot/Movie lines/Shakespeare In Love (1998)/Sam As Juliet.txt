By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
"ï¿½All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
I would not for the world!
"Ay me."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
