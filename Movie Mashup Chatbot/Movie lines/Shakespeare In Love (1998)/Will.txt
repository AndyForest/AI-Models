Oh�what have I done?
You are a gentleman.
Thank you, Ned.
Ah
Oh
Ned�I know�I know
You did not like the speech?
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
Mercutio
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Lady?
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
Do you know that house?
Really?
Yes.
Follow that boat!
Done.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Ten pounds.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Romeo
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
When I have fifty pounds.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Will it restore my gift?
yet cannot love nor write it.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
On my mother's side the Ardens
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
A goodly length in times past, but lately
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Nothing comes.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Words, words, words�once, I had the gift�I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones�for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery�but now
And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
Yes, I saw it.
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
How will it?
Go on.
What do we do now?
How will it?
We are lost.
By God, I wish I knew.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
What?
Romeo.
Cut round him for now.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Tomorrow
I did not.
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
I feel a scene coming on.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
To my weekly confession.
No, then.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Who wrote that?
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
She is always Aphrodite.
As soon as I have found my muse
It is all locked safe in here
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
This is a different one.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
Mercutio�good name.
The daughter of his enemy.
Do you think?
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
Good title.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
Wonderful, wonderful.
Kit
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I have lost my gift.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam�?
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
But the plague
You have opened the playhouses?
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
I have to get back.
Oh. What is your name?
You admire it?
Better fortune, boy.
I'll be damned if you are!
Who are you, master?
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
How does it?
and thus unable to declare her love
Orsino�good name
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
"�thou need'st not to be gone."
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
No�no.
You cannot marry Wessex!
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
I was the more deceived.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
A literary feud. Quite normal.
I know how to fight!
Then I will go with you.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Oh, but it is mine too!
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
Yes, some of it is speakable.
I must. I must
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
There is time. It is still dark.
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Well perhaps better than my first.
Oh
There is.
It is strange to me, too.
I am.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Can you love a fool?
You can bring them with a word.
Oh my lady, my love!
Oh--I am him too!
A lowly player.
The same, alas.
Will Shakespeare!
My lady!
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Your aunt?
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
She loves me, Thomas!
And break her heart and mine?
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
Do you understand me?
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
Wait there.
Where did you learn how to do that?
Take off your hat.
Your name?
You are on my ground.
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
A theatre poet?
A man, my lord?
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
Here we come at last, my lord!
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
How do I offend, my lord?
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
