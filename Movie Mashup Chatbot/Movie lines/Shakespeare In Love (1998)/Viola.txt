Every word.
Thomas Kent!
What happened to Sam?
No Juliet?!
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
Nobody knew!
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
I am not so well-born.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
Oh, but they can!
And I love poetry above all.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
Your Majesty
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Write me well.
Nor you for me.
I don't know. It's a mystery
But all ends well.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?�she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke�Orsino.
An excellent beginning  Let him be�a duke. And your heroine?
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
Will you read it for me?
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
You lie.
You never spoke so well of him.
Will! What--?
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
That's my line!
Oh, Will!
Oh, do not go
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh--no, no!
Mr. Henslowe?
It was the owl--come to bed
Moonlight!
You would not leave me?
And that was only my first try.
Even your play.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
I do not know how to undress a man.
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Can you love a player?
Oh, not for the world!
If they find you here they will kill you.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Oh but why "alas?"
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
Who is there?
He is dead?
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
I am going to church.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I mean�Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
Good morning, my lord!
I will do my duty, my lord.
The Queen has consented?
But why me?
Virginia?!
I do not love you, my lord.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
You flatter, my lord.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
My lord.
