But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
Above Lord Wessex?
And--?
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
What do you love so much?
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
Stand up straight, girl.
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
There was a wager, I rememberï¿½as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
