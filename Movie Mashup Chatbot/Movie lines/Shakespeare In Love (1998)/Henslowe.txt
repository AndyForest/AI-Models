See you in jail.
We have no Juliet!
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Yes, but very well.
Very well.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Oh, that.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
There's never any
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
It's a comedy.
I have a wonderful new play!
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Do you know it?
Who are you?
it will be all right, madam.
It is over.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
The show must ï¿½ you know
Another little problem.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
No, it will turn out well.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
The one who came with your letter?
What? Who?
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Nobody. The author.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Will! Have you finished?
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Now where? Will?
Where are you going?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
Fifty pounds? What for?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Who is she this time?!
God be praised!  Locked?
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
