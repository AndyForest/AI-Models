Me too.
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Can I get you something to drink?
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
