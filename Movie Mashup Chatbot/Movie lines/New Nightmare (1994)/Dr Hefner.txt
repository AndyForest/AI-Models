No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
These look quite fresh.
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Absolutely.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Diabetes?
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
