Like weird calls, by any chance?
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
Yes, but...
What?
And I...I've got other things happening.
So I don't know about horror.
I don't know, Bob.  I'm flattered and all, but I've got a kid, now.
You mean that was a...
Can I read it?
The nightmares.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
Yes.
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Like Freddy.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
He's had some sort of...episode.
Chase, it's Dylan!
Chase, you'd better come home.
Chase. Hi...
Guess so.
Just be careful, okay?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
What if it isn't over?
No, you don't.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
One of mom's cups got broken.
No biggie, really.
Chase...
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
I want my kid out of here now!
DO you mind...
Everything is not fine!
He was just here!
Doctor...
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
Oh my God...
Is he all right?
Like what?
Does he have to stay here over night?
No...
No.
No.
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
What...what is that?
Dylan, where's the man?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
You okay, champ?
Home, that's right.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
And...what's the man doing?
Your bed?
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
Right.
He's on his way.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Who?
They were safe and could sleep.
Tomorrow night.
Time for sleep.
This is going to give you nightmares.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
Rex?  Who's Rex?
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
What?
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
You have a fever, sweetie?
When do you think it'll be done?
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
Yeah...how'd you know?
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
In what, a romantic comedy?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
I'm fine.
Fred Krueger did it.
I know how Chase really died.
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
You really think Dylan's okay?
Really?
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Freddy, for all I know.
I've never mentioned it to him.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
What...happened?
I want to see for myself.
I want to see the body.
Yes.
Yes?
I just can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Choice?  What kind of choice?
You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
That was Nancy, not me!
Me?  Why me?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Then what is he doing?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
Captured?  How?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
What's that?
Robert?  I...
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
My child?  No...but...
No, not really.  I...
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Black's fine.
Coffee'd be nice.
Now?
Uh...sure...when?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Yes?
