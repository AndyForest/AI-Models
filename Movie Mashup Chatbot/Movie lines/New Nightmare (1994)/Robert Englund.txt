The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Call it a guess...
Darker.  More...evil?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Heather?  You doing okay?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
You okay?
