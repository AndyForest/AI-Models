Read me some?
A story?
Here.
Coming for you...
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
Right 'cross the freeway.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Home.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Why does God let there be bad things?
Do you have to die to see God?
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
In my bed.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
Not sleepy.
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
The mean old man with the claws.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Say how they find their way back home.
I like this story.
Finish, please!
Rex saved me.
Bye.
Someone's coming.
You going away?
no.
