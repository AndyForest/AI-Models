For what?
About what?
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
I'm Ok.
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here...  'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
Believe what you want.
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
What who's been sayin'?
What's up, Colonel?
And where you goin'?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
This looks done.
Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
You're a good sport, lady.
J.R., glad you could make it.
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
But you said "you."
What do you mean, "you"?
What do you mean, "you"?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
Well, I heard some things.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
How's that?
Well, that's what I mean.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Where you been?
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
C'mon, Joey.
Yeah, I know.
What did Tommy say?
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
What do you mean?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Say what you're gonna say.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Do you see her yet?
How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
You know, like bang her or anything?
You wasn't with her?
You wasn't with her, were you?
Yeah, she's nice.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
How do you know? You know her that good?
Go 'head.
Yeah --
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Who's that?
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
Answer me when I talk to you.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Go ahead.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Here's your glove.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
You heard me, I said hit me.
Hit me in the face.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Nothing...
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
At night?
What time is it?
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
What friends?
Don't make no difference no more.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
No. Open the door.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Open the door, Vickie.
Sure, what else is new?
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
I dunno.
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Then what?
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
OK. Talk.
What?
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
Yeah --
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
You did?
You're a fuckin' liar.
Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?
With Salvy, eh?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
What was it about?
What'd you see?
What'd you see?
I called. You weren't there.
Where you been all day?
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
That he's got a pretty face.
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
Huh?
You asleep?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
You're not interested in him?
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
What do you mean, "good looking?"
Now, touch me...  ...here.
Now take your panties off.
Go 'head. Do it.
Now take the rest off.
Do what I say.
Take off my pants.
Come here.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Come over here.
It's OK.
That's all right. He don't mind.
No.
Can you see it?
Just give it a nice little tap.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
He should.
Never felt better.
C'mon, Tommy --
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
