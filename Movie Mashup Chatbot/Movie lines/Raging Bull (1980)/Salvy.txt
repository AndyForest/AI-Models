Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
Excuse me for living.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
