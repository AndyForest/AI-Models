Can't you get the money from your friends?
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
But they don't have a case against you.
What are you doing?
All right, just don't make any noise.
The kids are sleeping.
Are you drunk?
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Why don't you just call him?
I don't know.
No, not that.
Why don't you just call him up?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
Jake --
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong.
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
Jake, no --
I am answering...
What're you talking about?
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
"Father of the Bride."
I went to the movies.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I took the kids to my sister's.
I went out.
What's the matter with you?
Jake...
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
You're hurting my arm.
All I did...
What did I do?
Positive.
I never noticed his face.
What did I say?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Yeah, what?
Yeah.
What?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
No, I'm not.
I'm not interested in him.
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
I was just...
But, Jake, I was just...
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
Oh, Jake.
I like the gym smell.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Jake...
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Jake...
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
What does that mean?
Can you see it?
I can't find my ball.
Should I hit it?
It feels real good.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
You don't talk very much.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
I just wanted to say hello.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
