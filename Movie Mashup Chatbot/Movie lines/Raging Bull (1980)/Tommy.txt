All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
How's the weight? Ok?
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
