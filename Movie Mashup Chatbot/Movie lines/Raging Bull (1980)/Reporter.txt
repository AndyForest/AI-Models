What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
You sound bitter.
Does that mean...
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
