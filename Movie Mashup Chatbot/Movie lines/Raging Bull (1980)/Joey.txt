Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
How can he embarrass you?
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Whatsa matter with you?
Whadda ya mean?
What?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
So what?
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
What?
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
I did keep an eye...
What?
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
No, I just told you what happened.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
When?
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Screw you, Jack.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Except fall down like a normal person.
See? That's all there was to it.
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
Stick out your hands, Jake.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Whatcha doin'?
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
Nah, she would never...
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
You want the title shot or not?
You want the title shot?
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
You want us to wait for you?
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
Give me a chance. Let me look.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
With her? How?
Huh?
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Whadda you care?
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Jack! Enough!
Jack, I got no gloves.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
You want me to do what?
Sure. What is it?
You know?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
What's wrong?
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
I said, let's go.
Right, the gym.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Hey, leave the kids alone.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
And you're drinking with them right now.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
It don't look right.
No, you're his wife.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
