The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
Do you wanna sit down?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
