GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.
Give me your keys, Don.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Don't do this, Don.
And how much is braces?
Your teeth are fine.
You don't need braces.
Braces?
What is that?
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
