Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
Sure is.  So why call me?
It was scary though.
Oh, she's fine.
My mother had breast cancer.
What kind of Cancer?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Uh-huh.
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
I'm here, I'm listening.
Well what's the situation?
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
