If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
Bite it, Cynthia.  You could get free things from people that want you to endorse their products.
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
Saucy-saucy.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
Was it a call back?
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
The fuck is wrong with you?
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
That's pretty cool.
What do you do?
