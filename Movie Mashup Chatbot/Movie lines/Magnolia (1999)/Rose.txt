You should know better.
No.
Yes you do.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
But you can't say....
...Jimmy...
Jimmy, did you touch her?
Did you ever touch her?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
...say it, Jimmy...
I think that you know.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I'm not through asking my questions.
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
Well maybe.
Do you have any children with anyone?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
What about now?
How long with Paula?
How long with Ellen?
No one else that I know?
hey.
Who?
Was there anyone that I know?
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
Yeah.
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
No.  No.
You're my handsome man.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
It'll take the pain away.
Bye.
I love you.
Did you tell her?
-- did she talk to you?
Come home soon after the show.
Slowly or quickly?
How you doing?
