Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask, you understand?
What happend, what's going on?
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
Can you hold it?
Not enough, what do you want?
What?
C'mon guys, settle down --
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Sure, why?
It's upstairs.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
Ready to go,go,go?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
-- Richard.
