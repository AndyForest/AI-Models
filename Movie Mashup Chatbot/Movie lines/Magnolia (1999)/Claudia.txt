GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT.
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I don't wanna talk to you.
Don't sit down.
What the fuck do you want?
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
He's not my boyfriend.
What do you want? Why are you here?
...what the fuck is this...?
just let me walk out, ok?
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
Just say no.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
I've got troubles.
You don't know how crazy I am.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
That was so great what you just said.
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
What?
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
Can I tell you something?
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
ok.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
I'm sorry --
What?
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
You wanna make a deal with me?
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
Why not?
So you've done it --
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
Great, bye.
It's my favorite place --
Billingsley's?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Eight o'clock?
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
Really?
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
Well...is that illegal?
You wanna go on a date with me?
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Good bye.
yeah, good, ok.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
I'm sorry.
If you're not here for a 422 --
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
Thank you.
Ok, ok. I'm back.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
You won't.  You won't have to.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
It's not -- what's a 422?
-- is not my boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Yeah.
You take cream or sugar?
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
-- do you wanna cup?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
I don't have a boyfriend.
Yeah.
Yeah.
About two years ago.
ok.
What are you lookin' for?
It's fine.
I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
No.
No.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
No.
Yeah.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
No.
Yeah, but I don't know --
What?
Wilson.
I'm sorry.
For what?
Yes.
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
I'm coming!
