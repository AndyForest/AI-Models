Are you ok?
What happend to you?
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
Will you say my name?
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
All your other fluzzies?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
Then what?
Did your wife find out?
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
