Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
Yeah, hey. Chad.
It's a helluva disease.
Oh that's good.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Brain and Lung.
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
Does this sound weird?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Twelve.
Graduation?
No.
No.
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
It's ok.
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
Is Jack your son?
Who?
Who are you gonna call?
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
Go fuck myself?
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
There's no asshole like you.
I've seen it before.
Yeah.
-- memory?
When was the last time you talked to your son?
She loves you.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
I'm trying.
No.
Where is he?
You do?
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
How's today then?
Alright.  Thank you.
Is this 509-9027?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Hi.  Is Frank there?
I don't think, he can't...
yeah.
...ok...
It's interesting.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
About three weeks ago.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Ok.
He's in here.
These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
....it's alright....
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
