THAT'S NOT MINE.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
I didn't hear anything.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
No.
No.
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
I went out last night.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
I don't know a loud crash.
I didn't do anything.
I preffer to stand.
Marcie.
No I Said.
I live alone.
No.  I said that.
You're here.
What does it look like?
I don't have to answer your questions.
I AM CALM.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
There's no disturbance.
There's no disturbance.
I am calm.
You're just come in --
You can't just come in here.
What? What? What now?
