You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Yeah.
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
She lived in Tarzana.
She does.  From when you were a boy.
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
It's all important --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
Are you asking me that?
This isn't meant --
I would just want to clear some things up:
-- just to clarify --
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
-- let's talk more about your background --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
Let's talk about --
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
I'm gonna start rolling --
All it takes is one second?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
