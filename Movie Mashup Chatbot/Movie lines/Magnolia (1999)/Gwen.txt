Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
Kind of.
They wouldn't?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
And "Frank?"
It's not your given name, right?
Where does that name come from?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
In five years?
Do you have your masters?
Psychology major?
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
I wouldn'tve asked --
I'm sorry.
And your father?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
Are you close?
Does you mother still work?
Why does that sound silly?
And what did your parents do?
the valley?
Where are you from originally?
