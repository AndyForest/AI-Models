"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Gently, son --
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Stay that way.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Mmm.Hmm.
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
Shall we drink to that?
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
Picky, picky.
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
Brad, dear?
That's right.
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
Might of been before my time.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
Well --
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
This sounds threatening.
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
