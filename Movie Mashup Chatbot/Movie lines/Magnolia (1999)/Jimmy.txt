Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
In my sleep, Burt.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
ooohhhhhh no.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
Your mother wants to hear from you --
Honey.
Please put your clothes on, please --
baby, please, please --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
No.  No.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
Fuck no.
I got in trouble at school.
I won't.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Yes.
Yeah. Yes.
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
No.
...you know...
You look great.
Fuck.  I think I'm gonna throw up, I think.  I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old.
I can't fuckin' do this.
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
I need you to get me Paula --
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
What were you saying, Stanley?
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
I don't know what I've done.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
I don't know what I've done.
...I don't know...
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
I really don't know.
I don't know.
...No....
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
Do you know the answer to this?
Maybe...I don't...
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I love you so much.
I don't know....
I don't.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
Two years...three years...
Just once.
No.
That's it.
Paula.  Ellen.
Rose, I don't --
Yes.
I'll answer anything.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Will that help?
Yeah.
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
I'm a bad person.
Do you love me, Rose?
How do we do this, then?
It's not really pain.
I don't think I want that.
Love you too..
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
As fast as I can.
I'm drinking.
I'm sorry.
I'II go....is it...back here?
Can I come in?
I'm her father.
You're her boyfriend?
Yes.  What's your name?
Are you her boyfriend?
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
