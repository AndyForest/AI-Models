You okay, Miles?
Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?
You got it.
Glass or bottle?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
How's it hanging, Miles?
What do you think?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
My condolences.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
