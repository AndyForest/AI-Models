I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
They're just leftovers.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
