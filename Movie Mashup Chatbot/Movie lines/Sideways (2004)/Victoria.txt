See you over there, Miles.
I'm pregnant.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
I guess.
I am.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
So what's happening with your book?
So how're you doing?
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Ken.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Where are you?
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Miles?
Hello?
