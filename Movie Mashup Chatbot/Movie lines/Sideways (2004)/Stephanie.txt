You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
What happened to you guys?
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
Not so bad yourself.
Good. How're you?
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
Oh yeah.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Stephanie.
That's what people say.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
See you, Miles. You take care.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Oops. Sorry.
Huh.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Where's Jack?
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
That was fun last night.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
So what do you think?
