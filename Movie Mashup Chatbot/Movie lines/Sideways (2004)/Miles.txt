So I guess that's it.
Yeah, I'm here.
Huh.
And?
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
I'm good.
Say, is Maya working?
Bottle.
Highliner.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
What are you pouring tonight?
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Gary.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Back at you.
Yeah.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Well. That about does it.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
You broke some.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Look at this!
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
What's wrong?
I'm fine. You rest.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
No, I'm okay.
Quite a week.
That was quite a day yesterday.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Hold on.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Me?
So what's the plan?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
She tell you she was married?
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
No way. No way.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
What?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
What?
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
Uh-huh.
What's that?
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
Huh. Let me think.
That's thoughtful.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Well?
Keep it elevated.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Thanks.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
Let me use your phone.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
I don't have to.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Are they too sporty?
Do you like them?
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Let's leave it alone.
It's private.
No.
Put me down, Jack.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
You have to tell me --
What exactly are we going to do?
What's happening?
Slaughterhouse.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Is what the money thing?
I don't want to talk about it.
Throw me his ball.
Fucker hit into us.
What is it?
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Shut up.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Obsessively.
Could be anything.
Nope.
You're an asshole.
Thanks, Jack.
Can you give me some room here?
Nope.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Yeah.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
That was three years ago after that first party!
What? Of course I like Christine.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Understanding of what?
Deep.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
What?
Besides what?
Does she know about Saturday?
With this chick.
What the fuck are you doing?
Where is Stephanie?
Yep.
What'd Christine say?
Right now.
You should call her.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Count me out.
We were supposed to play golf.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Bathroom.
I'm fine!
Okay! Fuck!
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Aye-aye, captain.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
So what should I wear?
Nah. I want to watch this.
Well, she is cute.
With Maya?
What?
You have the keys.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
I want to go home now.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
She what?  When?
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
Nice, huh?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Fuck you.
Have you no shame?
Shut up.
How do you know?
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
She works for tips!
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
And she likes Pinot.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
Sure I know Maya.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
Pour us a couple.
Then it's a good thing.
If that's what feels right.
Uh-huh.
So you're going to stop acting?
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Whoa.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
It's not even a mile.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
Are you chewing gum?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
Now.
That's what you do with every one.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
What do you smell?
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Now we're talking.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
And Lexapro, yes.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
I'm working on it.
I'd rather have a knife.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Um... seventy... something.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
And?
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
Don't open that now. It's warm.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
I can't help the traffic.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Oh, Maya. No.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
I'm sure he believed every word.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Maya.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Okay.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Well, nice to see you now.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Good. So did I.
Got it.
Bathroom over there?
Yeah? Like what?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
Sure.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
A paper?
Yeah. Thanks.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Um... yeah but it's more...
"The Day After Yesterday."
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Yeah. Definitely.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Is she sleeping or...?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
What was the bottle that did it?
How long have you been into wine?
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
Yeah, I know.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
She got anything good?
Hi.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
That's what I'm having.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Nice. Very nice.
Oh yeah? How is it?
What are you drinking?
See you.
The Windmill.
I finished it.
You want to join us?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Maya, how are you?
Yeah.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
You quit drinking?
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
That's great.
That was big of him.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Ken.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Hello?
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Victoria.
I told you I need a drink.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Good stuff.
French or American?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
How much skin and stem contact?
Stephanie! Stop!
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Where?
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
You golf?
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
He had to make a phone call.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Should we get dessert?
Exactement!
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
You talked to Wendy?
It was a surprise, Mom.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
