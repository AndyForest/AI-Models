You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Are you there? Miles?
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it.

It's about the marketing.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
How's the trip?
Miles.
