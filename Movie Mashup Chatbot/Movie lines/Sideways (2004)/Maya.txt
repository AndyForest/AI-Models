Well, in that case...
No, we're paying for the wine.
You are not.
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Anything I'd know?
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Are you a writer too?
Highliner, please.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Yeah.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Were you ever going to say anything?
What rehearsal dinner?
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
About two-thirty.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
You too.
I had class.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Goodnight, Miles.
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Okay. See you around.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Yeah.
Like what a fraud he was.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
What about me?
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Well...
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Oh. You mean... today?
What's the title?
So what's your novel about?
Yeah, weird. But great.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Yeah, same here.
You got kids?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Hey.
Are you all right?
I'm having the salmon.
I know. I love that.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Twelve months in oak.
Try it.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Good for you.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Sure.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
