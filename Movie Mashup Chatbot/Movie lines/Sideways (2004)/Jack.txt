Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
I love you.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
So what's up?
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Two years ago, buddy.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Is it chicken?
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
They're from both of us.
I can explain.
Hi.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
Me too.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Nice.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
I am one of those guys.
Maybe. Recognize this?
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
No, I'm an actor.
That's on us.
Hiya.
You were wearing your belt.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Love you, man.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Why don't you come in?
Whatever. Sorry.
You need a new car anyway.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
I'll pay for it.
You said it looked like a car accident.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
I feel like driving.
Come on, let me drive.
You're so negative.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Want me to drive?
Yep. Quite a day.
Hrnrnrn?
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
The plan is... you go.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Yeah.
Please, Miles, please.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
We gotta go back.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Fucking chick's married.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
You know what I'm thinking?
What's it look like to you?
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
Yeah.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
What's that supposed to mean?
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
What's up?
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
I say we check it out. You never know.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
I know what you need.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
What?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
Huh.
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
I SAID OKAY?
I said okay?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
We're on.
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
With Maya.
Is it the money thing?
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Huh.
Been checking your messages?
What do you think's going on?
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Nice shot.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Oh yeah. Sure.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
What?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What're you drinking?
Hey, there you are.
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Okay! Jesus!
I will.  See ya!
Yeah. Okay.
Oh, boy.
Later.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Did you drink and dial?
Where were you?
Pull yourself together, man.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
We're on.
Get the trunk.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
I'm a quick learner.
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
What do you think?
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
Miles.
Beautiful.
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
So what's the plan today?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
You're blind, dude. Blind.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
Perfect.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
She is very hot.
You know that chick?
You know her?
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Yeah. Tight.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
It does. Feels right.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
We should have driven.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
Just a minute!
Want some?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
How would you rate this one?
When do we get to drink it?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Huh.
What color is it supposed to be?
Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
This is rose, right?
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
I owe her a call anyway.
Let me call Christine.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
And get your bone smooched.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
You still seeing that shrink?
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
That's your problem, Miles.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
That's a good age.
How old's she going to be?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
What?
Whoa, why are we getting off?
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
Oh yeah. Much better.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Sure is tasty.
Just tell me.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Oh, that's tasty.
Yeah.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Yeah, Conundrum.
You said you had it all lined up.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
