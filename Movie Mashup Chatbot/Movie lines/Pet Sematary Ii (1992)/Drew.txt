Zowie...
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Just until he heals up?
Is he gonna be okay?
You ever think about running away?
I gotta go back and do my chores...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
It's weird...
Maybe it takes a while...
You think he'd believe it if he did?
He was dead. You know he was.
Yeah...
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
The old Indian burial ground.
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
There's a better place...
I'm not burying him here...
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
Zowie.
