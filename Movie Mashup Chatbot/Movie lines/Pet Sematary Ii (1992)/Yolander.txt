Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
