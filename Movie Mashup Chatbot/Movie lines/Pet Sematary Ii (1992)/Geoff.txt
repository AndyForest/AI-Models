Anywhere but here.
All set?
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
I'm not hungry.
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?
Just out.
I'm going out, Dad!
Who was that?
I still can't believe she's dead...
What?
It sucked.
I'll be fine, Dad.
Sure.
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
How long ago did this guy retire?
All the time.
Go later...
Dies?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
What do you mean?
How can he not have a heartbeat?
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
You never get over it.
You want me to help?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
What did?
Why not?
Is this a good spot?
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
He pissed me off.
What's his name?
Mom...
I know, Mom.
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
Right here, Mom...
