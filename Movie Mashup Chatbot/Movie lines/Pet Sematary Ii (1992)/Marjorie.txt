I hope he doesn't have rabies.
You sure did...
What happened to you?
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
Is something wrong?
