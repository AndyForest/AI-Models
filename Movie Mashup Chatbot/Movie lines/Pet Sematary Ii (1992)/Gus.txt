I was building a doggy door.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
I suppose so.
I hear you moved into town.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
