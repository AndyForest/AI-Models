My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
Well... uh... thanks...
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
I... um...
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
How'd you know that?
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
That's Renee alright.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
Pretty much so.
Yes... why?
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
What?
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
What do they do up there?
Out?
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
So where're we going?
All set.
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
What are you talking about?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Hey! Where're you off to?
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I think so.
You alright?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
What's wrong?!
It's been a few years.
