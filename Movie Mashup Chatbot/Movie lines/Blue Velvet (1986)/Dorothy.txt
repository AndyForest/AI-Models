Hold me. I'M FALLING!
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Hold me, Don.
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
They hurt his head.
My secret lover.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
No.  Hi baby.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I want you to stay with me.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
I did. Are you?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I love you Don with all my heart.
Just get outta my bed.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
I asked first.
Do you love me?
Kiss me.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Beeeee careful.
Does that scare you?
Frank would open you.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
You like to open me, don't you?
No police!!!  No police!!
I want you to hurt me.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want to do?
Do you like my body?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Yes. Frank--
It used to make me laugh, but.
Come in.
Please, please stay.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Don? Are you in with them?
Falling.
Look.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who's it, you mean.
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Oh shit.
I liked being with you last night.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
Yeah, hurry up though.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
You don't?
Do you know?
I made it go down the toilet.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
Do you like me?
You can hit me, if you want to.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
See my nipples?
See my breasts? See?
Do you like the way I feel?
Thank you. honey.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Don?
Sure I'm alright.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Lie down on the bed.
Do you like talk like that?
Do you like that?
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
No way.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
THEN WHAT?
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Shit. You better tell me something.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Yes? What is it?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Oh he forced you, huh?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Alright, suit yourself.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
If you want to.
Those are my breasts.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Yes, but.
Frank?
Where are we going, Frank?
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Mommy's here.
Hello, daddy.
Hello, baby.
