Look Jeffrey.
No Jeffrey!!
Go ahead!
Go ahead.
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Probably not. No. Why?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Dorothy Vallens?
No.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Okay.
Just a minute.
NO.
Really?
You want to dance?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
It's okay.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's good to see you.
What was that all about?
What is it?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
You didn't tell him about me?
Everything okay?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
You like mysteries that much?
Jeffrey? Why?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey!!
Oh yeah?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Shoot.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
What am I going to do?
You were late.
Goodnight.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Who, me? Why should it?
Yeah?
Did you see her undressed?
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
You saw a lot in one night.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You want to tell me about it?
You want a Dairy Queen?
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
He got a little jealous.
What did you see?
Well, how did it go? What happened?
Okay, okay. Bye.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Okay, yeah, call.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
OK.
Yeah, but.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
I'll drink to that.
That sounds good.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Brilliant.
What's the plan.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yes. I do.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
So, what's next?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Are you alright?
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Alright.
You've got a point there.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Now, how are you going to do that?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
I'm here, aren't I?
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I don't know.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I've gotta go in.
What happened to him?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Maybe so.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
That's too bad.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Terrible boring.
Yes.
Am I bothering you?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Stop it Mike.
Okay.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
You can change it if you want to.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
