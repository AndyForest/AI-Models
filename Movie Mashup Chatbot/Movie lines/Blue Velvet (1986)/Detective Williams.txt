Not yet.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
You're all through with this now?
Who knows you have these?
Is Sandy part of this?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Okay?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Yes.
The criminals are winning.
Okay.
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Jeffrey?
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
Come into the study a minute.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
You did? A human ear?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Yes.
