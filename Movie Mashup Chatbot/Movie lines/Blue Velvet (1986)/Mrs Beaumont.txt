You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Of course, Jeffrey.
Alright.
Do you want the car?
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
