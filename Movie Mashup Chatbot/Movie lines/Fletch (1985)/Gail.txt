I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
John Ultramalensky, right?
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
Where are you going?
