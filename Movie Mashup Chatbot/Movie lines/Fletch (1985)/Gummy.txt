Yeah. Maybe.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
What's that?
Why are they after you?
What?
Fletch?
I know. I got bad luck or something.
They busted me last week.
Itï¿½s okay. The cops did it.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
