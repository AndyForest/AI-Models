Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Just relax.
There is?
Breathe easy...
Just relax....
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Oh, he was dying for years.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Funny old bird.
Well, which one?
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Your aunt?
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
No children?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
That's two.
Two bs?
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
So where do you know Alan from?
