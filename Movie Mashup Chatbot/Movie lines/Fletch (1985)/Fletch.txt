Comanche Indian.
God I admire you.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Oh, thanks.
What?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
You're kidding.
Not luck. They don't want me.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
They didn't do anything.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
Hey, what are you doing?
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
Creasy, how old are you?
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
I wasn't asking.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
That's what he said.
Maybe tonight?
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Thank God, the police.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Not a prayer.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
Can I ask anybody now?
My God, you're serious.
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
You can't keep me here.
Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
It was planted on me, sir.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
Fletch F. Fletch
Fletch.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Margaret.
Right.
Mrs. Smith.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
I don't know. I don't have any.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
That's Babar.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Yes.
We play tennis at the club.
Gum thought Brazil.
What?
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
You don't have a piece of the action?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
Affirmative.
Affirmative.
I'm serious, Sam.
You don't know me.
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, don�t you?
I think I�d rather have drugs.
For sure?
Like when?
No idea at all?
So what do you figure?
He'll be so relieved.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
That's it?
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
Thank you.
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
I'm fine.
Where am I?
Right. Fine.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
Are you serious?
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
My lawyer was a bum.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Whoops.
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach� cases.
Cut the crap and read it.
Read this, please.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
He sighs.
Then he has.
Has he?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Ten days ago?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Right.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
No problem.
What are you doing here?
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Right.
You sure did.
Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
That's Brazil.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Twenty years.
Sure you did.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
I'm the Sufi.
They bust you every week.
I know.
Hi Gummy. How�s the eye?
Sure.
You sure got the hard part.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
You sure those doors will be open?
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
They serve dinner on the flight?
Where am I going?
Take it where?
Sure, all drifters do.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
A .357.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
I have the same problem with my help.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
I'm still here.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
So why pick me?
Why don't you try suicide?
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
I'm all ears.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
Charmed.
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Why not?
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Nothing to it.
Yeah.
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
Maybe.
Thanks.
Spot right here.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
Did you hear something?
Don't say shoot, okay.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Deal.
Can I steal you for a minute?
No, thank you.
How long have they been married?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
You've met her?
I'm sorry?
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
You shouldn't be here.
Come here.
They're trying to kill me!
You can't do that.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Gail, please.
I think you better sit down.
No.
What's wrong, Gail?
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
Act natural.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
I'll take you to a game.
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
You saw a forgery.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
That's what I want to know.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
Yeah.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Long story.
Thanks for the great time.
How come?
What about his parents?
Good point.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Why'd you let me in?
Are you still in love with Alan?
Can I ask you a question?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
No. He was. I got him out.
I saved his life during the war.
Lunch...
Yes.
Here, take mine.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
I ordered lunch.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
I was hoping you'd say that.
Hi.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
What's he doing in Utah?
You are a rich woman.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
I have this effect on lots of women.
Why do you keep doing this?
Preoccupied with what?
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
Please.
So were my parents.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
John Ultrarelamensky.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Sierra del fuego.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
I would, actually.
One.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
I'm her cousin.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
So you're saying she moved out.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
She moved out?
Where is she?
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
I commend him on his choice
I commend him on his choice.
No wonder.
The door was unlocked.
What?
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Not really?
You were going to can me, right?
Forget it.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
Print this Frank.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
You'll have it.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
How could you call him?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
I have some ideas.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Gummy and two cops...
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
I'd say charcoal.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
Practically.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
Why not? Oh shit... really?
Looks great.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
I never read the paper.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
Two...
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Uh, almost.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
My secretary.
Frieda's boss.
Yeah.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
