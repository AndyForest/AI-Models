Fletch.
I was upset.
Not really.
Fletch, you want an apology?
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
What...
What?  Who the hell are they?
I want something I can print!
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Get out of here.
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
What about finding the source?
Utah?
Just give me a hint, all right?
You're onto something. That's good. What?
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
How gray?
Who?
So let's go! We run the pictures.
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
You broke it? You know the source?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
I don't know.  Look!
...never reads the paper...
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
Irwin...
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Fletch.
