I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
I want to hear this.
Don't worry, I can take it.
I'm terrified.
Don't tell me I can't --
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Bastard.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
What is this....
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
What are you talking about?
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
But I've seen the deed.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
What does all this mean?
How do you know about that?
What are you talking about?
So?
Who.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
Why did you do it?
I think you should call me Gail, now.
What is this?
He never sees them and I never met them.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Depends on the question.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
It's amazing.
You were in the war?
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
God...
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
I mean put clothes on.
I really should change.
Down boy.
You ordered it here?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
Hi.
John Ultramalensky?
Who is it?
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
See what I mean?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
Alan's in Utah.
I bet you do.
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I love the outfits.
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Damn, I thought I had that one.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
That's a strange combination.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
John who?
John! You used to fly together!
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
In a minute!
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
You don't know the Underhills?
John!
Yes?
