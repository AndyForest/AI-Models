This one's going to be even more fun.
Greetings, everyone.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
That a boy.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
What'll it be Fletch?
Ask anybody.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Full name.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
