Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
What the hell are you doing here?
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
And what was that?
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
I'd have been long gone.

Wait a second --
What?
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
Of course.
Good evening.
