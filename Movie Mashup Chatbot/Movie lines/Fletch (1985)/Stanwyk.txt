Will you kill me?
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
That's right.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Do you have a passport?
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
In this drawer....
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
I want you to murder me.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
Come inside.
Who?
Alan Stanwyk.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Because we can't.
We can't talk about it here.
