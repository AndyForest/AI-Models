There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Great.
No.
It better be good.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
I'll go down and speak to him.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Where the hell are you?
Ippolito!  Get back here!
You said the system couldn't fail!
What doors?
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
Everybody.  Get behind me.
I smell it.  It's here.
The sub-basement?
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
I think I should come with you.
How big is the sub-basement?
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
What happened to them?
Oh.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
You're kidding.
So the method of death is the only connection?
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Call me Vince.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
We need light in here, stat.
What's left of it.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
This place is a maze.
I'd say we're in its home.
What's that doing here?
What does it say?
All right everybody, hold up!
Not so loud.
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
I know.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
Got my hands full here.
What is it?
