Fifteen... what's next?
Oh Jesus...
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
Hurry up!
Let's go!
Forget it!
What's the combination?
Where's the walk-in safe?
Oh no.  I smell it.
Jesus, what is this?
Oh... my... God!
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Argo!  Hobbes!
Holy mother, what is that?
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
They've got something.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
