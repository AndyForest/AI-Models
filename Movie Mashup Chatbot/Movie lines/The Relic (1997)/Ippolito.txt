I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.

I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant.  There are safeguards built in.  We have back-up systems with redundancies.  There's no way these computers can fail.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
