Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
Curious.  There's something missing.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?

Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
