Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
What's that?
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Oh shit.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
It's still back there!
What happened?!
It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
Dr. Green has to see you!
Lieutenant!  It's me.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Eats them?
So what?
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
What kind of egg is it?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
What do you make of it, Margo?
What's that?
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
Frock's been fired.
Margo, you haven't heard?
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
