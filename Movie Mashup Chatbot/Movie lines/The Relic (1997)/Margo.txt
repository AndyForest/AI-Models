Dr. Frock?
We will.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
What's that?
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
I think so.
What's going on?
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
What are they?
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
What is it?
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
I'm not giving up.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
I don't believe it.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Yes, I do.
Okay.
How about lunch?
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
What kind of hormones?
It's reptilian.
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Mbwun.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
That's impossible.
What?
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
But at what a price.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
I can't!
Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
Just like John.  He won't listen.
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
You smell that?
Help someone!
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
The answer's right in front of us.
We have to try and draw it off!
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
I think... it means it's full.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
What is it doing?
What are you going to do?
Is there another way around?
The planetarium!
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
Wounded?
You're not.  Where is it?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
That's not what I saw.
Behind me.  Over there.
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
You were behind me?  Running after me?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I don't understand.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
How did you know that?
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
I don't understand.
And John?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
