I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
Yes.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out.
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
Apparently it's huge.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Correct.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
I believed them.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
Unfortunately, no.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Lieutenant --
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Whose footprints?
Where's the head?
Mind if I have a look?
The body?
Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
I hope you liked it.
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
Footsteps!
He's right.
I don't believe it.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Where is that?
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Read it out loud.
I wouldn't be so sure.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
How many storage areas are there?
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
Keep the animal quiet.
Another storage room.
Quiet.
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
He's right.  Follow me.
Get back!  Now!
Stop!
Shut them up!
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
You have to.  Do it now!
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
I have to shoot.
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
I don't believe it.
What?
We're not going to make the storage room!
It's coming.  Run.
Oh God!  Help!
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
How?
For what?
Then it won't go after the others?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
What happened?
It's scared of me.
Hide quickly!
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Vince!
That was D'Agosta.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
Gone.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
Genetic damage?
What was it?
They're all heavily armed.
Dr. Green...
All right.  If you're positive.
Where did you see it?
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
What happened?
All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.
Where would we find it?
Would you mind showing it to me?
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
What happened?
A monster?
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
You were going to be married.
You loved him.
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
You have time to talk?
Maybe not.
No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.
How does it work?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
