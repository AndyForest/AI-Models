Why not?
The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
Someone broke into this room.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
Sweet Jesus!
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
I appreciate that.
I don't want to scare people.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun.
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Calm down.  I found it!
I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
Behind you.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
