Clarence Teal.
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
Of course.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
What happened? Is there a problem?
Who is it?
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
You don't want to know.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
I what?
Is there a problem?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
Spread it out.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
Open your shirt.
You can't kill me like this.
I'll give you something.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
For now that's all.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
Are you in charge, Roper?
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
You don't have to come here.
