Yeah, they are but...
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Roper...
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.

There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Roper.
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
