Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
I ain't interested in your life story.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
