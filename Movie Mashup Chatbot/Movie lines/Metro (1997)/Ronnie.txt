Prude.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
...the hell are you talking about?
Scott...
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
I've been thinking.
Scottie?
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Scottie...
Scottie, Scottie...
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
And you think he'll...
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
Yeah?
There is?
It's very nice.
How's Paco doing?
Just now.
It's okay. We broke up.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
Scottie...
Yeah that's it.
Mmm, needs a little something.
And it's hard to get.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
It's already started.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
If you did, you never showed it.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
What do you want from me?
Scott, You can't save everyone.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Maybe you should be.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Hey.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Greg.
You worship yourself.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
