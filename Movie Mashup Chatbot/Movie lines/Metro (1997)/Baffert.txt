I'll take half of your action.
What's the line?
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Apartment 306.
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
Where's the stereo?
Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
No shit! He's good!
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
Dinner's on you.
Floor seats.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
Not that we know of.
I don't know.
No -- you can't do that.
SWAT wants to go in.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Could I please have a little water?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Where did you find an old recording like that?
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
