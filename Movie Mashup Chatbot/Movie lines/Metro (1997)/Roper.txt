It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Good. I don't want to be late.
You want me to go up with you?
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Yeah, okay.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Deal.
You're my hero.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
They're not usually graduate students.
Hello, guys.
You got it.
Manual or automatic?
You want a convertible or hardtop?
You're gettin' the car.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
I need to get something straight first.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
What do you got on Korda?
Anything on Korda so far?
I have to go face to face.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
What's the suspect's name?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
...a car.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Yeah.
It's all there.
Satisfied?
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Is that all?
Yep.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Stay put.
McCall, you all right?
Good question.
That's a chance I gotta take.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
That it is.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Pull up alongside.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Damnit!
He's cutting down the visibility.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
Occasionally you lose.
About six years. My partner took me.
How much you wanna bet?
We lost.
The jockey!
Yeah, first and second.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
To run late!
That's okay. That's his style.
Still needs work.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
You know why I like the track?
Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
What did you see?
Okay, stop.
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
Why?
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
What's the first commandment?
You know the ten commandments?
Get good at it.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
It'll come. Try again.
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
You think you can learn, McCall?
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
Where did you hear that?
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Every couple of months, huh?
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Explain how that works.
You living together?
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
You got a girlfriend?
You have to. It's a tradition.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
Not the ones I'm at.
How are we gonna get him out of there?
I'm not sure.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
How did you like Toronto?
You'd never been out of New York?
You don't like New York?
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
Recruited you from where?
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
Try to remember that.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
It rarely has to be done.
How do you feel after a shooting.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
Is the hostage injured?
Have you evacuated anyone?
Which apartment?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
My name's Scott Roper.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Let me show you something, Ray.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
I know how you feel, Ray.
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
The hell I am!
You crazy? With all those people around?
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
A deeper level?
Yeah.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Do it!
Stay here, don't move.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Use your imagination.
Korda escaped.
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
...Let me just show you.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
You like this place?
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
When?
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
What do you think?
I've been craving that stuff all week.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
As a matter of fact, I do.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
Ronnie...
You think I didn't need you?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
I've proved that, didn't I?
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
That a new picture?
Can I come in?
You heard.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Please. I'm begging you.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
I worship you.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
SHIT!
Where's the damn wire?!
Stay up there, Girl...
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Come on!
Are these yours?
What have you promised them?
Any verification on numbers.
What do we got?
Who's running it!
Who's running it?
I want to be put on this case.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
Repoed this morning.
The car is part of the deal.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
And a car.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Your concern is heartwarming.
Define concern.
Depends. What's up?
What?
Tell him to give me a raise.
