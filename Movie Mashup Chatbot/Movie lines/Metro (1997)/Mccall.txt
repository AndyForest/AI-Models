Is that where you're family lives?
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
How can I help you with the particles?
Tell me what's wrong.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Who's controlling your mind?
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
So what do you want to do?
And what if you can't live with it?
And what about the ones you don't save?
How many have you lost?
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
You're crazy.
What the fuck is going on.
He's got the girl.
And doing a very good job of it.
There's your answer. He's smart.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
Is it always like this?
How long you been coming here?
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
We won.
We won!
COME ON, RUSSELL!
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
They need to run first and second?
The 6 horse is still last.
To run last?
The 6 horse is last.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
I'm just practicing my lying.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
Fine.
I do.
I have two words for you... Seek help.
You're a compulsive gambler?
Why did he do it?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
To save lives.
Yes.
You tell me.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Yes.
It's against my nature.
I'm not good at lying.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
So what do I say to this guy?
I can't do that.
Tell me what you need.
No.
I think so.
I think I can handle that one.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Do you really?
We see each other every couple of months.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
I don't gamble.
Why? You like my ass?
Well, if I have to, I have to.
I don't really like to drink.
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
We could fill it with water.
Is there something wrong with that?
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
It was okay.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
National Marksman Competition.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
What's the point of this?
I know.
I've rarely shot anyone.
Like it had to be done.
Only at the very end.
If you say so.
Sorry... Habit.
I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
