I won't get away with it.
Don't make do it, Mike.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
What happened, Mike.
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
