No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
I know what I saw.
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
Jesus Christ ...
What do you mean?
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
Hello?
That is the story of my life.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
Wha .... ?
So where is it?
Then tell me what to do.
I don't know ...
What can we do?
What will he do?  What does he want?
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
And what did you discover?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Oh, Terri ...
Terri?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Would you know this store again?
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
Every day.
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
How have you ... ?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
I'll boil some water.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Taken what?
Did you know him?
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
I'm trying to quit.
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
What?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
Why are you so interested?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Oh yeah ...
What?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Right.  Right!
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
Uh-huh?
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Where?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
What happened to him?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Can we see?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
No.  We want ...
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
