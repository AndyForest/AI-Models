Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
Unh-unh.
No.  Thank you.
Yes really.
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Welcome. 38
How do we start?
But how in God's name ...
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Fuck you!
No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
Yes.
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
What ... What ... ?
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Really?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Not quite.
