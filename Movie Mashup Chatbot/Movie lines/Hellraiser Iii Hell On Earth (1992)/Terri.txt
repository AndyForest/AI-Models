Joey ... ?
What am I looking for?
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Buying some drugs, alright?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Sure.  Why?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
But I don't know what's going on.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
And he still sits there?
Who's that?
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
I'll do it!
Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
I figured I'd make breakfast.
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
That's great.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
Sorry.
What is it?
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Right.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Really?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
Yeah right.  Look ...
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
Oh, I don't ...
Yes. 53
I miss you too.
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
You're apologizing?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
