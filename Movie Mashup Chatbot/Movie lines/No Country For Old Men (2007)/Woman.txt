Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Hello?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
I can't say.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Did you go up to his trailer?
Yessir?
I do like you.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
What else then?
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
I got beers in my room.
That's got two double beds.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Another additional.
You want to change rooms?
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
The option.
You tell me the option.
