No.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
He can take all comers.
He won't neither. He never has.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Not word one.
No I ain't.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
I put it in, Mama.
I got it Mama.
It ain't even three years we been married.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
Not like that. Not like you say.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
You gave your word?
...You got no cause to hurt me.
...I need to sit down.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
I ain't got the money.
She'll be all right?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
I can hear it in your voice.
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What should I do?
Llewelyn?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Llewelyn?
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Promise?
You can't afford one?
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Llewelyn --
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
So... for how long do we have to...
Well -- how come?
Why would we go to Odessa?
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
What're you goin' to do?
Goin' where?
What're you doin', baby?
Llewelyn.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Big talk.
I need to know that.
What'd you give for that thing?
Llewelyn!
Did you buy that gun?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
That'll be the day.
What's in the satchel?
