Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
Well -- where ya goin'?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
No me mate.
Not a bleep.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Mm-hm.
Huh? What is...
What's this about?
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Yes?
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
That's not an answer.
How well do you know Chigurh.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
When did you last see him.
