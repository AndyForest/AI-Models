I mean the nature of you.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
You go to hell.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
And where is that.
What's that.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I know where the money is.
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
I'm sorry.
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
...I'm wondering...
Okay. We can stop that.
What do you want to know?
Well enough.
Okay.
Yessir.
Yessir. I understand that.
No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
November the 28th, last year.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
No. You don't.
The heroin. You don't have it.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
To kill your wife.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
So was I.
Were you in Nam?
Pot metal?
I don't mean braze.
Cast iron?
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
What did you do?
...What do you do?
No. You don't understand.
Took me about three hours.
Not that way.
It's called a transponder.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
...But that won't last.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
