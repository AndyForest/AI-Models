Yes. Things fall into place.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
To your husband.
No. But I gave my word.
I wouldn't worry about it.
No.
No.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
I know where it's going to be.
I know something better.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
Why would I let you do that?
You expect him?
Is Llewelyn there?
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
Yes I did.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
I don't know.
Airport.
What airport would you use.
You from around here?
How'd you find it?
All right...
...You getting anything on this?
...Where's the transponder?
Screwgie.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Step out of the car please, sir.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
All right.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
...I know where you are.
Do you know where I'm going?
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
...You need to talk to me.
You know who it is.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Yes.
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Everything.
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Just call it.
Yes.
Call it.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
You married into it.
You married into it.
You've lived here all your life?
You live in that house behind the store?
You said that.
I could come back then.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
...What time do you go to bed.
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
What time do you close?
See about closing.
You already asked me that.
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
With what?
I don't know. Will there?
I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
Didn't mean nothin'.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
What way would that be?
This. And the gas.
How much?
