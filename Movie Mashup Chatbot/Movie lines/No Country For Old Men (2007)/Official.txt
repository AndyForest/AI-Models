What outfit.
Nam?
Are you in the service?
Don't jack with me.
Are you jackin' with me?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
