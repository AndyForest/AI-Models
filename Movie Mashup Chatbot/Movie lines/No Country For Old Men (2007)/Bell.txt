I'm... discouraged.
Most don't.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
When did he die?
Yes I do.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
Yes, you've circled round.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
That man that shot you died in prison.
How fresh is this coffee?
Want a cup?
Didn't know there was any.
I am older.
How you been, Ellis?
How many a those things you got now?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
You heard it?
How'd you know I was here.
Hard to believe.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Oh yes.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Uh-huh.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Yes.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
No money in his room there?
No ID in her room?
Carla Jean...
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
Yes ma'am, I do.
Yes ma'am?
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Some pretty bad people.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Would you tell me if you had?
Nothin'?
You ain't heard from him?
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
Natural to the line of work they was in.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
Okay.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
Well I don't either!
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Wasn't no bullet?
What was the bullet?
I don't know. He ought to...
I'm ahead of you there.
...Now that's aggravating.
I don't know. Oh.
Probably must be.
Believe you're right.
I'm hidin' behind you.
Gun out and up.
No. Probably I don't.
That's possible.
I don't know...
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
That's the boy.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything happens to Loretta's horse I can tell you right now you don't wanna be the party that was aboard.
...You ride Winston.
Uh-huh.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
...This month's checks.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
I don't know. Had dreams.
I mean, would you care to join me.
What do you think.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Well. If you say so.
I never do.
I always am.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
Hyah!
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
