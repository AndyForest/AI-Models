No sir, it's unusual.
Okay.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
What kind of tent?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
You already have the tent?
Tent poles.
They'll give you a wallop.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
