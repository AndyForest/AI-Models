Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
...How'd you sleep?
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I can't plan your day.
Okay.
Don't hurt no one.
Don't get hurt.
...Be careful.
That's very nice.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
I thought it was a car afire.
