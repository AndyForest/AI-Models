She'll be all right.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
What makes you say that?
What did you tell him?
You know what's goin' on?
Hey.
I shall return.
Yes ma'am?
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
You should be used to that.
Uh-huh.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Yes I do.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Odessa.
Well then I'll tell her myself.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Goin' out.
Yeah.
That'll work.
Just keep it up.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
What? Quit hollerin'.
No. I found it.
At the gettin' place.
It's full a money.
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
No. Do you?
So what're you goin' up there for.
You know she won't be there.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
Yeah? Where am I?
Why would I care where you're going.
I don't need to talk to you.
Who is this.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Good. I need everything else.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
You on all night?
One room, one night.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
The kind with the most poles.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Somethin' like that.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
I want you to take me to another motel.
It's all right.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
Then you'll like me.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Half.
Waitin' for my wife.
That's me.
No, one forty-two.
What about one forty-two.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Could I get another room.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
The what?
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
No I don't have it.
What product.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
Why would he go to Odessa?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
What did I say?
I didn't say braze.
Yes.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
I'm a welder.
I'm retired.
I been immobile.
Not any way.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I know how he found me.
Sugar?
How would you describe him?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
Yes sir. Two tours.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Yes sir.
No sir.
I got an overcoat on.
No sir.
I don't know.
You do, I reckon.
I don't know. American citizens.
