Let's just say, God works too slowly.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
Gosh, I hope so.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
I do love a good check mate.
ALIVE.
Enough for a test.
A piece.  Only a piece.
How?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
