I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.

Dr. Grey.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
What is it you intend to do to me?
The intention of registration act -
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
You mutant bastards...
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
