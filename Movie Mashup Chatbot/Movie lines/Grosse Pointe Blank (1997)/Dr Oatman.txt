Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
What else? Say more.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
What stuff?
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Yes.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
You know where I live?
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
Say more.
How do you know?
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
You went to school with these people.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
