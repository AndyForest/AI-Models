Overflowing with love.
To make a long story short...
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
Yes.
