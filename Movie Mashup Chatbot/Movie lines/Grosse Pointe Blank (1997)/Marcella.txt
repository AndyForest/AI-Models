Will do.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
You have.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
What's it look like?
This is not good.
Don't forget your identity.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
Enough?
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
They were very upset.
In Detroit. This weekend.
They blame you for the compromise.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
They're not happy, sir.
That's going to cost.
All of it?
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
This?
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
