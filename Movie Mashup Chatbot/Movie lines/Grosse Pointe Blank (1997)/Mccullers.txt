No...
I get it.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
One cannot love and kill.
He using her.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
Wait a minute--
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Whatever.
That's strictly Bï¿½ader-Meinhof stuff.
--Nooo--
I don't think so.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
In Portugal, yes.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
