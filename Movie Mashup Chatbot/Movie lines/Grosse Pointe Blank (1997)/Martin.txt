Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
It's what I do.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
Yeah...
In the corporate offices.
Yes I do.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Whatever I can get away with.
Wonderful.
Don't say that.
I'm Martin Blank.
Then express yourself, Bob.
What do you want to do?
You could've been a contender, huh?
Really?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Okay. See you later.
It's me. Martin Blank.
Bob...
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
So you eat-- read it everyday?
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
You don't understand...
What if I come back?
Will you come with me?
I was leaving.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
...About five years now.
It's something I do...
No.
Yes.
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
--She's not dead---
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Shoulda brought my gun.
Right.
Do you want to get a drink first?
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
You look beautiful.
As long as I get the laugh.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
Yes.
Seven it is.
Yes.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
That'd be good.
What's that?
Bad television.
Bad people.
Bad experiences.
Well, there's not much to tell.
It's always the little things.
That's part of it.
Are you going to the reunion?
You see someone?
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Where have I been?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
I'm a professional killer.
Not much else.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
Here is now there. There is here.
Ten years, I think. What I miss?
How long has it been?
It's nice to see you again.
This is me breating.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Out Loud?
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Morality.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Mmm.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
We're both professionals, Oatman.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
I just know.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
Come on.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Up on the right.
Okay.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
No.
You understand the psychology of the job.
I work alone.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
There you go. I left it blank.
Okay.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
Is that right?
No deal.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Hard to get good help these days.
No harm no foul.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
Thank you, no.
Like a union?
What do you want?
I guess.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Those all seem kind of related...
That sounds pretty interesting...
Hey, Bob.
Not bad. You?
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
Tell them my house exploded.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I've looked at it.
It's fine.
I'll do it tomorrow.
See you next week.
I have scruples. Next.
Never enough.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
There's nothing to be done about it.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
And they want me to make up for it.
He didn't.
I'm not happy.
I'll pay.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
Throw that away.
Patch him through....
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Yeah...
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Yeah. I guess we did.
No, I don't have one.
You have a headache?
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
Jim?
It's a place where religious people--
That's wonderful, Mom.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
I have to get my head back into my work.
It didn't work out.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
Mein Dealer.
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
He sells BMW's?
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
No.
No. You drove us here.
Debi's house.
You too.
Fair enough.
So what happened to you?
Paul?
Wow.
How did you get this job?
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
I'm a professional killer.
Why not?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
How's that?
How are you? How's business?
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
