See you in ten years.
Work's good for the soul.
That's too bad.
As long as you had a good time.
What the hell happened to you?
He gave me a great deal.
He sold me this bad boy.
Thank you.
Ten years. What happened!?
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
God it's great to see you.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
You're leaving me hanging here...
Marty! It's me. Paul.
