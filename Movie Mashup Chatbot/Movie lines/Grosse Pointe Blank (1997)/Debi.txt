Other people can't.
You kill people.
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
I'll hide.
I'm staying here.
That's probably a good idea.
You never could have kept this from me.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Jesus Christ!
You're a government spook?
Get the fuck outta here.
Is it something you've done?
Not the other way around...?
He was trying to kill you, right!
Like love?
Like heroin?
No time.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Which would you rather...?
We haven't seen each other since high school.
What?
I think they'll probably have booze there.
...Let me get my coat.
Okay... Hold on...
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
Flowers. That's funny.
You're fucking psycho.
Hello...?
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
Are you there?
I'll think about it.
Unbelievable.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Watched television?
You met people.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Yep.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Okay.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
What's your business?
That's it?
Tell me about yourself.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
I just play my own collection.
