Excellent. Here they come.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
