When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Suppose I take a look.
And you're all alone.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Even women?
What's the matter -- restless?
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
How far up the trail?
Where is he?
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Who brought you here?
How do you know who we are?
Yeah, we sure have.
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
I said let's go.
Because there's a man I want to see.
We got to get movin'.
Lookin' around.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
Put on another one.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
