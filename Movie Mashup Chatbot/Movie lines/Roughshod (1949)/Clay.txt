Look of things, she doesn't.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Who shot who?
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Maybe he did.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
And one of 'em is sick.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Where you going?
Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.
Thanks for taking over.
Goodbye, Mary.
Maybe they will.
Hurry up.
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
It's going to Sonora.
I'm sorry.
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
I suppose that's my fault.
All right -- it's said!
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
What?
Maybe it's better that way.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Why do you think?
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
It's too light yet.
That's fine.
Will she be dark or fair?
I'll make the soap myself.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
The who?
Thanks.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
I hope so, too.
Coffee?
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
Hold on.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
His letters will keep.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
Yeah.
Go on, there's a good boy.
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
What's the matter with her?
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
You can stay here if you like.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Just about.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
This must have been in the family a long time.
What's the matter with her?
Anybody hurt?
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
So did I. They were in it.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
No they won't.
I can't --
How's that?
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
You'll live.
How's that?
I just wondered. Let's go.
Is that the only reason you came back?
What did you come back for?
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
You want to split up? --
I don't care what she asked you.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
You better start.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or --  -- go back and watch the horses.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
Finished, son?
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
That's right, Steve.
Good thing you didn't.
How'd you happen to miss?
Swimming.
I've got eleven horses.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
All right. I'll tell you.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Yes.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
I don't want to run short.
Like what?
A man I used to know.
That's right.
A little hot.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I can't take her with me.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I can't take her with me.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
Three men on matched roans?
