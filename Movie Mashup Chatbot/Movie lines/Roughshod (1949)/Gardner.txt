Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
Nobody. The light was bad.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
