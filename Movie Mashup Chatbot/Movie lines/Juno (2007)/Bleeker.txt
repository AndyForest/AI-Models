You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Thanks for the message.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
I don't think so.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Can we make out now?
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Mine too.
Wizard!
It does?
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
I try really hard, actually...
What, you mean as friends?
You know it's okay.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
Why?
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Wait, let me take that.
No...
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
You're being really immature.
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
We're getting a stretch limo.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Um, hi?
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
I don't like Katrina.
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
We could get back together too.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Well, I do.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Oh. That's a relief.
Is that normal?
Really? What are they like?
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
I miss it too.
What's up?
Okay, cool.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Or something.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
But you copy my work every week.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Whose idea was it?
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
So, what do you think we should do?
I'm supposed to be running.
I don't know...
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Cool.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
I don't really know anything about it.
Yup.
Yup.
Yup.
Oh, hey Vijay.
