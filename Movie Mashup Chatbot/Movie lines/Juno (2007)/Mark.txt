God, you're so young.
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
What's the matter?
No?
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
I'm leaving Vanessa.
What are you?
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
I actually know this one.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Come on, I have something for you.
Nope. We're safe.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Go learn something.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Cute?
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Hello?
Cold feet.
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
You're something else.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
That suits you.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
We definitely want it to have junk.
I know what junk is.
Junk?
Well, it can really only go two ways.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
You're kidding!
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
I wrote that.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Commercials.
No, more commercial stuff.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Yeah.
You weren't even alive!
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Oh.
What do you play?
Shut up.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Viscera?
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
It's a loft.
Yeah, downtown.
Looks like it, yeah.
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Don't mock me.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
Hm.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
They're yellow.
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
