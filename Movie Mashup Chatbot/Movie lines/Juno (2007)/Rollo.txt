So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
