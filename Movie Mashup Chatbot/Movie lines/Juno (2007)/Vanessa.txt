Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Juno? What's going on?
Wow! It's magical.
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
No...
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
Oh my God...
What...
Is the baby okay?
Then what's going on?
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Oh really?
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Can I take your coats?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
A Pilates machine?
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Aren't you the cool guy?
A hotel?
Have you found a place to stay?
We're actually, finally doing this?
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Like what? Be a rock star?
What would be a good time for you?
She answered our prayers.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
What are you referring to?
What?
What did you do?
Juno, what's the matter?
Can you see it?
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
And I disagree.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
You guys are playing music?
I want to be a mommy so badly!
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
