That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Or...
What?!
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Tore up from the floor up?
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
You mean like couples?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Excuse me?
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Who is the kid?
You're pregnant?
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
What do you make with that?
So. What's that thing?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
You don't say.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
