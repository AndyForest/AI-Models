And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
But you just said that a month was too...
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
How are you?
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
I don't love you.
I love you.
Good night, my love.
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Why?
Aren't you going to change?
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Why?
Nothing.
Then I'll see you later.
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
That's why I asked you...
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
Claudia, let's get married?
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Then why do you say them?
Does it please you to say such things?
What is it, Claudia?
Are you joking?
Who knows why they all left...
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Claudia, listen to me...
And what about you?
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
It takes even less.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
But then when will we see each other?
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
Then I'll go with you.
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Yes, maybe that is better.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Are you feeling better?
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Nothing... nothing at all!
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
And why do you tell us this only now?
No.
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
And why haven't they left each other?
Shall we go for a swim?
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
Don't be so humble.
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
There too...
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Ask her.
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Unfortunately, no.
Thank you.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
And do you remember where she got off?
And how come you're up so early?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Whose boat is that?
But where did you come from?
Are you the owner of this place?
Your mother?
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
They didn't seem too good.
Yes, we will.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
I'll go and get my valise.
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
You really must do me this one favor.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Is that far from here?
Is that possible?
Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fiancï¿½.
You're kidding!
I would like to ask you something.
Zuria?
