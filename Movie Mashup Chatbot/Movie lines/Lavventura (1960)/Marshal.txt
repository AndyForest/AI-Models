Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
I think it's possible.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
We'll try again.
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Anything new develop?
