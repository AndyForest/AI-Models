I'm certainly not going to swim across.
This one is gorgeous.
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
Did you sleep well?
What! After giving us such a run around...
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
But where are you going?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
Somebody must live here!
There's no comparison.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
How wonderful!
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
Well, what?
At what?
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
What is that one over there called?
I deserve it.
Tell me once more.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Late, very late.
I'm too sleepy.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
What are you saying?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
No reason why...
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Okay. In a few minutes.
So, you wonder why?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
What! Get married?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
And why did you drop them?
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Any news?
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Oh, Sandro...
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
Yes, you should go.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Yes, very much so.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
And how do you explain that?
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
Find anything?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
How should I be ... arrogant?
That seems to apply to you also...
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
It means being without money.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
I'm not coming.
Do you consider that a compliment?
It's divine!
It was futile. We went all over.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Better dead.
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
It couldn't be any clearer.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
But for what reason should I come there?
To the shark.
