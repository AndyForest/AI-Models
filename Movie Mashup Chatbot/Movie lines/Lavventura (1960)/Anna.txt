There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
A little more so this time.
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
Wait for what?
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
Then how come you're not with him?
When do you have to go back?
She'll wait.
We'll send the raft back to you.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
Then why don't you try it on?
Which one shall I wear?
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
I'm thirsty.
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
But how could you say such a thing?
Used to what?
Four or five days.
No, Dad, it isn't.
