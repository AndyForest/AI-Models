Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Lady Patrizia!
