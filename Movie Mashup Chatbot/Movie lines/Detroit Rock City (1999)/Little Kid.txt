You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
