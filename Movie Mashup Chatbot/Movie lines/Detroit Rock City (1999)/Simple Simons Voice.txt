Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
Yeah, you did!
Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
Is that your final answer?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
