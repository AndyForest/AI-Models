Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
A bustier?
Was it a teddy?
Well? Continue! Continue!
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
No...
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
That's it?
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
