Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
No, I mean... you love your son?
You love him?
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Who's Whiskey Dick?
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
What the hell is that?
Huh?
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Thanks, miss.
I-I c-can't...
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Whoa... she is a killer.
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
What's that?
Yeah, a man's drink...
Got any KISS?
Hawk.
Any luck?
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
What's in Sandusky?
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
What are you, high?
Nah. Couldn't be.
Tickets?
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
What the fuck!
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Curly.
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Damn straight we are.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Weird...
Whoa... she just farted.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
YO, DOOFUS!
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Could be.
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Dude, this is all I got.
Go ahead, Jam.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
They're what?
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Cool.
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
Jam, listen up.
