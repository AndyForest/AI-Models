Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
What? That's disgusting!
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
