Bye.
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Ann Arbor?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Right, slow...
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Beth? I can't believe it.
Yeah?
It's okay.
Thanks.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
I got...
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
It was stolen!
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Check.
Check.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
What's gone?
It's my Bullworker.
Hawk?
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Mom, what're we...?
I said, I'm sorry!
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
They're not idiots.
But, mom!
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Ahh, sunshine.
Uhh... nothing.
Oh, hi, mom.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
No.
Yeah.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
