Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Oh, screw it!
We've got to take this slow...
You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Believe it.
Jeremiah?
Sorry.
No problem.
