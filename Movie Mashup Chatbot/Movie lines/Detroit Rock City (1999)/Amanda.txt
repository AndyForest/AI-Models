I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
More than anything in the world.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Gin.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
