Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
The easy way.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
