Whatever... stella.
You got in the car, didn't you?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
What's it worth to you?
Plenty, but it was all bad.
One more time in English.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Namely?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Yeah.
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
It's gone.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Let's lift up her shirt.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Simplicity, Hawk.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
I did it! I did it! We won!
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
What?
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
Two hundred bucks?
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Look, you can have my wallet...
What do you want?
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Neither do I!
Not if I shoot first!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
The KISS Army!
