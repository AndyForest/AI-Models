Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.

Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...

Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
We'll be back tonight.
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
In the yellow ribbon.
The Hostages...?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
Precisely.
What do you know about them?
Yes.
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
...that's the general idea.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
Who's gonna tell'em.
The American "people"?
Who would find out?
What's it gonna cost?
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
....we landing?
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
What is it?
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
I'm working on it.
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
And you?
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
All I need is the one day.
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks?
Who's got the story?
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
Who we got here...?
Out in Oklahoma.
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Hello...?
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
We're locked into Albania.
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
...what is this?
Whaddaya think?
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
We're due at Andrews.
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours.
Would you go to War to do that?
Why do they go to War?
Why do people go to war?
I have a question for you.
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
What <u>are</u> you interested in?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
My name is Ronald Brean.
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
...you the Press Office?
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber.
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
When's he coming back...?
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
What're you doing?
A proud tradition.
No.  You're right.
Naw, naw, we own the airways...
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.
They'll be here in ten minutes.
You got a dime....?
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
No, I'm On Top of it...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
You can't tell this story.
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
I'm tired.
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
Uh huh...why?
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u>, ruin'd your <u>Culture</u>, but...
Wake up.
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
...a masterpiece...
You've <u>got</u> something, there...
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
The Albanian Campaign.
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>.  Because Schumann's the Shark.  He's ...<u>Jaws</u>.  You have to <u>tease</u>'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  Bring'em back <u>slow</u>, the President...  No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Mmm.
Mmm...
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in...
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
...we get our hands on him?
Where is he now?
...this the Guy.
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
No, it's...  I'll, yes, I'm holding, but...  No, it's ...
I think it's fine?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
Yeah...?
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
I saw it on TV.
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
President's speech.
Three-o-three...
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
"Back End" ... count on it.
W...what?
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
You can't have a war without an enemy.
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
We don't need an Act Two.
...who is this guy...?
"Freedom."
I'm sure they do.
Because.
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks.
...that's what it is.
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship...
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
Who?
Why not?
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing.
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Remember the Maine...
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
What do you think would hold it off?
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
What do you want the kid to say?
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
