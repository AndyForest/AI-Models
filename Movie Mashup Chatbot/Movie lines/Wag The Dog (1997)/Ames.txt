What are you talking about?
...the Harvester...
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...

And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
...The Albanian Campaign...
Indeed it is.
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...

And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>...
What can it hurt.

The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>...
No, this is great.
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
Could we have you in here, please...7
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?

Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.

And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
...fourteen years...
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
8 days and we bring it back home....
...this is magnificent.
You're tired, Ronnie.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
How long you been up, you need a nap.
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.

New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
...what's the Long View?
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
...I just hope...
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
...can we see the Kitten...?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...where is the Back End coming from?
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
What did Albania ever do to us?
...<u>nothing</u>...
Why?
<u>Who</u>?
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
...they sound what?
Why?
...you want us to go to War...
...but...
Yes
...the...
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
Tell me again.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
I'll see you at National.
Twenty thousand dollars.
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
What would do that...?
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
It won't hold.
<u>Do</u> it...
What crisis?
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
We're going to have to explain away the...
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
It won't hold.
When do we bring'em back?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
Don't you want to know if it's true?
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
Oh, MiGod.
