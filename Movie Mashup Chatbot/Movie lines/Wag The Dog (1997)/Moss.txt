And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
Naa, fuck this, this is nothing.  Oh, Lord -- this just got <u>Big</u>.  I see it -- <u>Big</u> -- Big for <u>you</u> and big for <u>me</u>.
What rig?
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
No, no, no...
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
Come on.
Come on.
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"...
He's not fine.
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
...and...
...twelve years.
Wilfred, that's not bad.
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
Izzat the thing...

Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
What can it hurt is they offend me.
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
I don't think you're gonna need it.
King, we've got to be on the streets in...

Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
...how ya feeling, boy?
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?

You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
Why not?
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...

How's our friend?

Mmm.
An anti-psychotic...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
Uh...
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
...givem what they want...But...
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
Of what?
Might, if I was asked...
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>...
Well, I'll be damned if I <u>know</u> ... you know... doing this <u>thing</u> ...  You know what the worst word is, in the English Language?  It's ï¿½retirement."  What the <u>hell</u> was I thinking of?  Hell, I used to...
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Big mistake.

...<u>isn't</u> it?  Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
All the greater accomplishment.
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
...that's right.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
You do your job right, nobody should notice.

"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh...
The War ain't over.

"The Country Is At War."
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
