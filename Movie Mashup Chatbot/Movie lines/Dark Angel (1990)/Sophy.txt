Mommy, I'm scared.
When?
Mommy, where are you?
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
But why can't we stay here?
I don't want to move away.
