None of your business.
What the hell are you doing?
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
How come I never hearda you before?
That's a lotta crap.
What're you talkin' about?
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
What?
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
No wire.
Guess again.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
