And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
She was there...
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
You mean until you showed up?
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Only one I can think of.
So are dogs.
Please...
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Unlikely.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Where?
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
How long you and me known each other?
You know what I'm saying.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
What?
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
