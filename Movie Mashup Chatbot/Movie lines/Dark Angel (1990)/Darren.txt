Where?
Can I say something in my defense?
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Could you give us a moment.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Do you know why I went after Justine?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
You're not still pissed?
How're ya doin', Max.
But I'm afraid of--
No way.
Lemme put some clothes on.
What?  Where're we going?
What is it?
You're roommates?
What are you doing here?
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
