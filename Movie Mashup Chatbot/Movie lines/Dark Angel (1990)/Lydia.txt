I understand.
Okay, okay.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Let go of my hand.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
You're also a fool.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Oh?
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
A friend of your fiance's.
