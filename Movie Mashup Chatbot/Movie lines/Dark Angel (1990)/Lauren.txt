Hello...
What else can we do?
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
Can you help me get her back?
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
They took my daughter.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
Soon, baby.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
What makes you cry?
No...
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
