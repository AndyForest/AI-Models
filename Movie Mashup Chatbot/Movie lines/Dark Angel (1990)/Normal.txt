What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
None.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
Can't help you.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
You don't want to.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
What about this?
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
For a change.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
More like deployed in bed asleep.
I want you on call here.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
