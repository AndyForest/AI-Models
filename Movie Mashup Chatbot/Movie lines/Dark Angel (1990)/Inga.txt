So Max, what do you do with all your money?
Am I?
I'll make it worth your while.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
What're you looking for?
Same old story.  Not interested.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Where'd you clip this?
