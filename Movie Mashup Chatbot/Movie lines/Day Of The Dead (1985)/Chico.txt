To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Please....shoot me.
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.

His madness....could be from shock.
Leave him.
