You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
You are dying, too.
NOOOOOOOOO!
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
TONY....TONY....
Dios mia.
