Come on!
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
This stuff really works? No shit?
A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
What?
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
What?
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
MARY!
Mary.
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
In the battle, sir.
No, sir.
Sir!
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
Tricks...Jesus...
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
What'dya get?
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
