Come on.
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
Look.
What is it?
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
Help me get him to the boat.
How long do we have to watch him?
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
What?
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Curse?
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
Gasparilla?
