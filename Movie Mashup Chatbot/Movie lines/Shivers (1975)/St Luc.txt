He sounded fine.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
No, nothing.
Yes.
Sure.
Down to the incinerator.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Where is he now? Do you know?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
OK. But late.
No. I don't think so.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Uh, OK. Sure.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
What happened?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Just breathe normally.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
Yeah? What do I do then?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
He didn't make it.
I don't get it.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
No? How come?
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
Yes?
Yes?
OK. I'll think about it.
Who was she?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
I don't get it.
It's crazy.
Did I say anything?
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
