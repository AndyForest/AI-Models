Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Hi.
He'll be really mad.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Nick, you're so strange...
You say something?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Can I call you at the office?
