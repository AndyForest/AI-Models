Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
Was he nice to you?
Hi. Want a drink?
So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
