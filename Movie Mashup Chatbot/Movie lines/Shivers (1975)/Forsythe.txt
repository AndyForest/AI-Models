But where are you going?
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Well? Supper at my place?
Anything wrong?
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
No. Dotty's the last.
Another kiss?
Kiss, kiss?
Do I get a kiss?
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
