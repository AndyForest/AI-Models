I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
Hi, Mike.
Someone's looking for you.
Sure.  No problem.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Musclehead?
'Preciate it.
Give me a ride?
SEAN!
He's diving!
It's okay, Sean.
What, hon?
Goes up.
Told you you'd like it.
Isn't this fun!
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Come on, it's fun!
Yes, it's great!
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Besides that.
Sean, do you have herpes?
Herpes?
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
And alone.
Come on!  Check this out!
How come?
Sure am.
I'm a water-skier.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Well, wait till you see the rest.
You like Florida?
How long you staying?
'Course they're also so rich.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
So, you just get here?
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Can't help it... ahh...
Gotta sneeze.
Ahhh, ahhh...
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
I don't talk that way.
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Hold still, damn it!
