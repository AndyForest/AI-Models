A piece of pie on Sunday.
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
He's big as a bloody bus!
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
Believe me, I am.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
And here I thought I was charming you.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
That's because I am the shark.
Philip.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Some miss all their shots.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
And I like you.
I like it when they wake up.
Not at all.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
Just watch it when he does.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
How's sleeping beauty?
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Afraid I can't do that.
Why?
Let's hope he knows that.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
So do I, love.
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
Well, then I'm going to film it.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
You can get killed!
That's preposterous!
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
No, no.  That won't do.
I thought they were clever.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
Yes, aren't we all.
Fine.  Have them do some.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Always do.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
I'll go with you.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
You have a man near it?
How far away is filter number four?
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
The world's southern most reaches.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
Polar bears.
No, South Georgia.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
Precisely.
Aww, can't I keep it?
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Calvin said it was all right.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
