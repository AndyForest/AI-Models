It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
And a missing man.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
I'll need more men to look.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
How many sharks have you killed?
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
No.
I'm  fine.
Only to myself.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
I am.  You're not.
Me.
That's right.
... Okay.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Come on!
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
You wanted to know about a cave?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
I don't understand.
Thirty feet???
What do you mean, we don't?
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
So?
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
I can't take water, Kathryn.
I have to get out of here.
Hydrophobia...
Well, that's why you got it.
So tell Calvin.
... He ought to put him in here.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
No,  I'm not going through there.
... Mean through the tubes?
Sure.  Let's go.
Okay.
What's up?
You don't.
Me, too.
How's your patient?
Sean, that's right...
You want me to stay?
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
I can use a shot of what he's got.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
Change your mind?
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
Kathryn...
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Bracelets.
Here.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
After what happened to us?
You're going down there again?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
And leave me down here???
Where are you going?
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
What's wrong?
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Oh, yeah.  Very.
I know, I built it.  I've just never seen it this way.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
... Friggin' fish.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Damn it!
Yes.
No.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
What do I do now?
I don't have a choice.
Where's the rubber band?
They're coming with us?
Not enough loving.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
It's his work.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
And what else is bothering you?
How come?
You called, Doctor?
Honey, I gotta go.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Yeah.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Pre-opening jitters.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Hope I make it through both.
What is it, 97 days?
Want another one?
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
How you doing, Kelly?
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Thanks.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
He's missing.
Sure.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
No way.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
Five hundred yards.
It's large enough...
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Oh...
Polar bears in Georgia???
What the hell's there?
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
Buzz off.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Yeah, poor bastard.
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
Make sure you put this back.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Hey.
All right, hit those lights too.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
That's impossible.
What kind of trouble?
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Sure.
She still talking to you?
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
You know Overman?
Come on, let's go.
Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
Gee, it's good to see you!
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
That's Dad...
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
He needs a haircut.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
How'd you do in school?
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Look great, don't I?
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
