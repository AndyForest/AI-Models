Take it up!
Take it up.
Let's go, let's go!
No...  It can't be.
Now what's this do?
Can hardly wait to do it again.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
No, think of something else.
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
The one that goes underwater?
I don't know, what else is there?
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
Why you sonuvabitch...
As always.
You were great out there!
This is where to be.  High and dry.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Are you really?
Depends on big brother.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
I don't know, it depends.
... Massachussettans aren't.
Massachussettans aren't.
Yeah, from Boston.
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
We're in love.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
Don't hurry back.
Something wrong?
I want to see Kathryn.
Who's grown up?
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Yeah, right.
Took it this morning.
So was Dad.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
... I'll go to McDonalds.
Sharks???
Got a job for me?
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
