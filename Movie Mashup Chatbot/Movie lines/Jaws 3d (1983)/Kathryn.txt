Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Go on, you're tired.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
With those camera lights and...
I can get it.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
Are you okay?
You don't have to prove anything.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
But you --
Michael, you're not going down there.
Who's going to do it?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
How is he?
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Somebody better get down there!
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
It's a shark's tooth!
Yes, you can.
Come on.
Michael, take deep breaths.
Honey, what is it?
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
It's too soon to move him.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
Yes.  It's faster.
No, we'll go through here.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
They said you'd be here.
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
Mmmm... you smell good.
Recovering nicely.
Finally.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Sounds wonderful.
... Me, too.
No, you're not.
No.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Yes?
Thank you.
Fine piece of engineering.
What's that?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
I know I can capture it.
Yes.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
How the hell did it get in here?
Michael...
I'm okay.
You all right?
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
Are you coming...?
I talked you into this?
Make up your mind.
Up.
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
Michael, the sub's dead.
That we swim.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Nothing.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
It's romantic down here.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
They just wanted to say hello.
Hi, baby.
Are you scared?
Honey... you all right?
Just put your mask on.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Get out of here!
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
I don't like what he does.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
Okay, bye.
My imagination isn't that good.
That macho pompous English --
See you later.
Don't forget you have your brother.
I guess.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
You will.  I'll see to it.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Well, not much longer to go.
Thank you.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
She, Mister Hutton.
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
How'd it get in here?!
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
Thanks to you.
Brian, he's coming around!
Get ready to go.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Why are you?
Thanks for helping.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Still sleeping.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
We're taking that shark alive!
What in hell is that?
You look like an orange worm.
I want that shark alive.
Like hell!
I will.
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
No!
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
I'm sorry.
I told you, something's upset them.
I can have them walk backwards.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Make this quick!
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Nobody told me.
Go where?
Not good enough.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
When did this happen?
And big for his age.
I know.
I think they'll come out now.
