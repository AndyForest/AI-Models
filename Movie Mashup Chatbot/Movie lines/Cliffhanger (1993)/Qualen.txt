The money!
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
Where are you, Walker?
Love's a killer, isn't it?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Tucker?
Go on, fetch.
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device.  Step into my office.
You know how the airlines are.
This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Travers, you're not running things.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
You said there was a way across.
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
Sue me.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
How far?
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
What's he doing?
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
Where's the helicopter?
Get off the radio!
No names, this is an open line!
You got what we need?
Give me the fucking code!
What's the code, Travers?
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
Then go fetch.
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?
Man against nature, right Travers.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Kill him when he gets down.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
Where's the third one, Travers?
Ask the questions.
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
What's the delay?
Why didn't you send the money over?
Travers!  Hurry it up.
