WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
You're getting warmer!
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Bags?
It can't fly in this weather.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Not on that leg.
Give him the money.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
My pleasure.
Would you?
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
There wasn't time for anything else.
I did what I thought was right.
Look, I know--
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
She's losing it!
The clip's not gonna hold!
I'm coming out!
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
Nice and easy...
That's it, you look like a professional.
There you go.
Sure you can.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
She's tough.
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
How're ya feeling?
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
Just kidding.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
Take the rope.
Take the rope.
We don't have time to argue about it!
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
"Time is money" -- please.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
I don't know.  I don't know.
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
Do it, goddammit!
Reach up!  Do it!
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Jess, c'mon...
Helluva time for vanity!
Never, what?!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Pull it apart!
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Next time, date only basketball players.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Up ahead.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Nice view, huh?
Cute.
A simple yes or no would have done.
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Yeah?
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
You attacked me.
Of course I do.
Call me sentimental.
Making things real rough for Hal.
I can't believe you just said that.
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
Don't worry about me, just go.
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Let's be creative.
Yeah, let's go.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
You got to go back now!
How'd you get up here?
What are you doing here!?
I only came back for you.
Can't do it.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
He can handle it.
He doesn't want my help.
Hal knows what he's doing.
Jess--you look good.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
From one professional to another, of course.
Flare up of old emotions...
Maybe lead to a flare up...
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Why are you yelling?
Why are you yelling?
You couldn't.
I don't expect you to understand.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
I don't think you do.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
We spent a night there one night...
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
Just hangin' out.
That's a virtue isn't it?
Do you see them yet?
Never could save a thing.
I burned it.
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
