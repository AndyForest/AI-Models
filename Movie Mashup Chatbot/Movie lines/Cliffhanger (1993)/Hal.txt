Fuck you.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
C-4?
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?
A monkey?
Surprise me.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
Take the gun.
I'm going with you.
What are we going to do?
Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
We'll never know, will we?
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
What the hell are you doing here?!
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
Hey, fuck you.
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
I love you, too.
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Glad you could drop in.
What are you talking about?
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
He never hurt anybody.
There is.
Murdering, motherfucker...
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
It's up there, on the Tower.
No, he's gone.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
He'll freeze.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
What the hell's going on?
There.  You blind?
Half a day.
On top of the peak.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
Tucker and Walker.
Yeah...
Right.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
You're looking at him.
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
