An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
What do you want me to say?
Well what?
Yeah? Who is it?
