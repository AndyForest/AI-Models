I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Yeah? And why is that?
So what's the time?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
