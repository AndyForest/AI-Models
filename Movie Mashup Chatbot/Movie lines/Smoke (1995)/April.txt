I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
And what are you, his chaperone?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
An invitation?
No! At least I don't think I am!
What!
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
I'd love to.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
What happened?
Jesus, what happened to you?
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
American literature. What else?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Will that be cash or charge?
