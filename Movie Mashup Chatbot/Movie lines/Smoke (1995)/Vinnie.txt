I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
Lovely.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
