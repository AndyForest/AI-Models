No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Like me, too.
Actually, I'm his father.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
It's my birthday.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
What difference does it make?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
So I can get my job back.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Open it.
It's for you.
A little. Not much.
Sure thing. See you later.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
Seventeen.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Thomas.
Thomas.
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Hi there, little brother.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
And have you mended them?
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
What's your offer?
It was just a thought.
Not a one.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
It'll cost you five bucks.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
Just passing through.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
It's all right. I really do know them.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
I'm not going to do it.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
It wasn't my fault.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
That money is my whole future.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
That's it. In a nutshell.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
And started to run.
Yeah, I picked it up.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Yeah, it might be.
I don't know.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
His only copy?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
I just did.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
The end.
No way.
The inspiration.
Come on, just a little hint.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
You work too hard, you know that?
What time did you get to bed last night?
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Let's not get too idealistic.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
You don't really want to know.
I don't have much time.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work.
I don't know. For helping me out.
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Two or three nights.
Three nights.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Eight-thirty?
What time is it?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Drawing's a good thing.
He's dead?
Is your father an artist?
Yeah, I can believe it.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
Yeah, that's right.
Here and there. Around.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
That's where the what comes in.
Of course. Where else?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Mostly what.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
I mean breakfast.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Rashid. Rashid Cole.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Well, if you put it that way...
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
Yes, please.
Yes, please.
Medium rare, please.
