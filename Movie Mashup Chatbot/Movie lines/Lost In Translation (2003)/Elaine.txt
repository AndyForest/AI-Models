You'll do it?
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
Bob, it's me.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
