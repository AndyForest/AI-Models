Yeah, I'll stay.
Ok.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Hello?
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Yeah, they told me.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Why are you crying?
Thanks.
Yes.
Yes, no.
That'd be great.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Charlotte?
Why can't it last?
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
Tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
So, where'd you go today.
What do you want to drink?
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
No, we'll find something around here.
I don't want to be.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
Do you know where we are?
Do you ever see him?
Where's your husband?
Yeah, look at that thing.
We should get you to the doctor.
What happened to your toe?
Nice one.
Four.
It's for my daughter.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
Because that would be too easy.
You are.
I know.
Where'd you grow up?
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
We established that we have no communication.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
That's ok.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
No, yes, it does...
You're possessive.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
No, I was looking at you.
Ok, whatever you want.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
I know, I kind of blend in here.
No, you smiled.
Yeah, you don't remember?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
I don't know.
No, its easy.
Hans was very attentive to you.
I see them every morning.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Of course.
Charlotte, who?
Hello?
I know. I don't either.
Ok.
No way.
Hi, Charlie.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
I know, it's stupid.
Ok.
I'm here for the week.
No, how about you?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Thanks.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Oh, what do you do with that?
What did you study?
What do you do?
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
I'm thinking about it.
Try twenty-five.
How long have you been married?
What about you? Why are you here?
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
Yes?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Oh?
Yes?
Bye.
Ok.
Tomorrow.
That's ok.
Yeah.
What?
It's ok.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
Oh, come on.
Like Japanese food.
Not all that pasta.
You know, eat healthier.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
I don't know.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
Uh, no.
Hi, Lydia.
Hello?
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Yeah, its really different here.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Lydia?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Hospital?
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Great.
Ok.
Hello?
