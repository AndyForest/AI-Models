Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Do you want to-
Fine. Is it going ok?
It's Lydia, your wife.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Fine.
Alright?

Is there anything I can do?
What are you talking about?
It's just carpet.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Is this a bad time?

Good-night.
Ok, well... I love you.
