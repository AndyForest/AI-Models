I'll miss you.
Ok, bye.
Well... have a good flight.
You're leaving right now?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Hi, Bob.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Well, I mean it more now.
I'm going to miss you.
When are you leaving?
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Around.
A coke.
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
No.
Yeah.
Working.
You think so?
It's bad isn't it?
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Fuck off.
Oh, she'll love it.
How old is she?
You made it.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
I know, but that's what you like about me.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
No one ever tells you that...
That's too scary.
Oh.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
And marriage, does that get easier?
But, I'm mean.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
Yeah? But look at you.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
I know.
Oh.
Oh, for her show?
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I don't remember.
Did I scowl at you?
Really?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
OK, see you downstairs.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
It's Charlotte.
I don't want to go home.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob � Charlie Brown.
No.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
See you later.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Oh, hi.
Hi again, how's it going?
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Philosophy.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Oh.
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Two years.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
What are you doing here?
I miss you.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Are you sure you have to go?
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Ok, I will... later.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Do you think it's done?
Yeah.
Bye.
Hair stuff?
Like popcorn?
You smell weird.
I don't know what to do.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
Sure.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
How'd it go today?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Why do you have to defend her?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Evelyn Waugh?
Ok, bye.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Sure.
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I�.
Lauren?
