Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
