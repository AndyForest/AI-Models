Certainly, glad to be of help.
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
But you won't sign, correct?
Come now, Mr. Chance.
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Have you served in the Army?
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
1952...?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
How were you paid?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Since you were a child?
... How long have you been living here?
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure...  ... Let's just keep everything legal.
... Yeah...
... What do you make of all this?
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Look, Johanna...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
No! He's a real gardener!
It's that gardener!
