... Yes sir - elevator!
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
Yes, ma'am.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
