Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
... In the garden?
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
... Oh, really...
... Hello.
I can certainly understand that...
It's not that, I just...
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
No, that won't do any good.
Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
... How are the kids getting along?
Good. Anything else?
Oh? What?
I would appreciate that.
... So what does all that add up to?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
So...? Where the hell is it?
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
This is not what I requested.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
Mr. Gardiner...
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
It's that serious, huh?
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
Well, Ben... I...
... Well?
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Ben!
