Very good, Your Excellency.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
