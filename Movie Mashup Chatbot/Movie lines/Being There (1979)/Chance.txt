Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Oh, really?
I would like to walk today.
Thank you, Robert.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
No, Robert.
Hardly any, Robert.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
It's fine today, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I will.
Yes, I will.
No.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Thank you.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Yes.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
... Straight out?
Oh, fine.
I see.
Yes. I think so, too.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
A Black man gave me the message.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Do you know Raphael?
No. I like this attic very much.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
That's very interesting, Eve.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Yes. I like to watch.
I like to watch.
Thank you.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Hello, Dennis.
Yes.
Thank you, Eve.
Yes. That could be true.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Good night, Eve.
I see.
No, thank you.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
How is Ben feeling?
Thank you, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
So am I, Eve.
Oh, I like that very much.
What is that?
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Yes. I was.
... Mentor...?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Yes.
Fine. He's very nice.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Hello, Eve.
Good night, Eve.
That's good.
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
I am a very good gardener.
No. I like it here.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
No. It won't do that.
Yes.
I like to watch. This is fine.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
No. I'm a gardener.
My name is Chance.
Hello, Eve.
I would like to watch television.
Yes. Thank you.
I agree.
Your family doctor?
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
Yes. I am.
There's no need for a hospital.
I have nothing more to say.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
No. I'm not busy.
Hello, Sid.
Yes. It's a very good show.
I see.
Hello, Morton.
I see.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Thank you.
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Oh, good.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
I certainly do.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Yes, I understand.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Ben is very ill.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
I agree.
Yes. I would like to do that.
A flower...
Oh, I see.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Certainly, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.
I understand.
No, Ben.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Yes. That is correct.
I see, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
I understand.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
No, Ben.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
Yes. I am very hungry.
I agree.
Yes. You look very sick.
Yes. I like that very much.
I feel very good in here.
... I see.
Yes.
I want to tell Eve.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
I like to watch.
What sort of bed is it?
Yes. I like to watch.
I can't read.
I can't write.
Hello, Ronald.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Good day, Sally.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
No.
Yes. Of men and women.
I never needed money.
Oh. Thank you.
Yes.
Yes.
... My suitcase.
... Yes. You can take me.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
Yes.
Of course. I would like to look.
I agree.
It's very sore.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
Yes. It seems to be.
... That is a very small room.
How long do we stay in here?
I see.
Does it have a television?
Yes.
I'm going to work in the garden.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes. It is.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
Yes. I've seen that done.
... I see.
Good morning, Louise.
Is his back feeling better?
I see.
... Good evening, Louise.
I am a very serious gardener.
Thank you.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Yes.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Which view?
No. I don't object.
I hope so.
Yes. That is surprising.
You're welcome.
Yes.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Correct.
I have no claim, Thomas.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Yes, I understand.
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
No, I do not have any of those.
I was given meals, and a home...
Compensated...?
No.
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
I live here.
I see...
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Yes. I will.
Yes. It has.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Yes, I will.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Good morning, Mr. President.
