Good day, Mr. Chance.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
... Oh.
Some pictures...?
What about money?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
... Then you really are a gardener?
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
... Would you take me on a tour?
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
