I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
