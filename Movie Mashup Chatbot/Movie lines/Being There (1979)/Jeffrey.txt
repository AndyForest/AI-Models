Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
Very good.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
Please, sir.
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
Let's have a look, do you mind?
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
