I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
I wish he were here...
... Do you think we should look for him?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
... But he's...?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
To watch...? To watch me...?
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
... Good night, Chauncey.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Chauncey...
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
Yes, so do we.
Our greenhouse.
Of course.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Your leg must be getting better.
Chauncey!
... Good night, Chauncey.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
He does...?
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
Did you lose something?
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
May I ask your name?
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
Oh? Certainly...
Would you care for a drink?
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
I hope you're comfortable.
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
... Ben, really...
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Do you feel well enough for that?
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
You heard?
No headaches?
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Good evening, Wilson.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Hello, Sophie.
