I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
In a day or two, yes.
Yes, I suppose that's true.
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
He does, does he?
... Oh? You've heard?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
... Were you going somewhere?
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... And please call me Robert.
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
An attorney?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
But not for long...
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
... He walked off...
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
No, Eve... I'm sorry.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
I have no idea...
