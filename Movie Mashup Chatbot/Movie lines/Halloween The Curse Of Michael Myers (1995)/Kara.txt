Is Tim there?
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Mom -- Who is this?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Danny!!!
I promise.
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
You can't expect us to stay here --
Okay ... But just for tonight.
Like what?
You've been watching too much TV.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
Come on!
What now?!
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Where's the baby?!
Danny?!  Danny!
Where are you going?
Halloween.
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
It's a rune ... Thorn.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Here.  Let me try.
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
You stay away from him!
My, God!  What have you done to him?
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
