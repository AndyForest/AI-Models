Mommy!!!
Promise?
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
No, Mom -- keep it on!
He says things.  Bad things.
But I've seen him!
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
The voice man!  He's here!
