Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
I've come to help your family.
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
Leave the boy.  Take me.
No!!!
You've created a monster.
Samhain.
Jamie's baby ...
Why did you take Jamie?
It was you.
This is madness, Wynn.
Where's the child?
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
An old friend.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
It's a sign.  He's come home.
Or what's left of him.
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
But surely Rogers isn't --
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
No one.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
What do you know about Michael?
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
Yes?
