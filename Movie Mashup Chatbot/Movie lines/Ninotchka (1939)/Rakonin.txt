I am sorry... I have to leave.
This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Your Highness.
