We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
What a lovely room you have here.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
And they might believe her in Moscow.
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
That must be the one!
What is it?
We don't like Razinin.
He's cutting our throat...
Capitalistic methods...
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crï¿½me de Bretagne...
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
Let's do that.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
It is Thursday!
Leon, my little boy.
What is it, my boy?
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
I think she covered you with the parasites.
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Razinin.
What proposition?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
Get out of here!
But you can't...
If you want to see us you must come later.
We don't want to be disturbed.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Bad news?
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Brave... that's right.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
A cow?
A day.
Two thousand francs.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...
Comrade Buljanoff...
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Right away... instantly!
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
That's even better.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Just looking around.
