...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
...des raisins de Mad�re, des framboises...
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Caf� de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
That's another thing... it's spring.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
I can tell you exactly.
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
Or it might be the firing squad!
Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.
That's her.
Positively not!
Possibly.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
No, that's bad management.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
How many families live here with you?
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
What do you mean they might -- they will!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
We had to take it on account of the safe.
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
Misha! Misha!
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Why should you be afraid?
May I ask how much your rooms are?
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
No, no.
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
We have opened a restaurant...
Shall we tell her?
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
I think I need my glasses.
That's right.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Yes, Comrade.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
With two f's, if you please.
Yes, Comrade?
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
Which lawyer?
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
How are things in Moscow?
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us?
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
The former Duchess!
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
