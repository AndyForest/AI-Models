Very well, Your Highness.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
No, sir.
No, sir.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Eight forty-two, sir.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Good evening, Monsieur.
