That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch � la P�re Mathieu.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
