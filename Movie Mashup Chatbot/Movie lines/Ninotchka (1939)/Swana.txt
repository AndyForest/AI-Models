Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
That's all right.
Good morning, Gaston.
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Thank you, Louis.
That's perfect!
Count d'Algout...
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chï¿½teau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
Hello, Leon darling!
She's gone, Leon.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
All right, I'll listen.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
How do you do?
Am I interrupting?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Is this your new dress suit?
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
That bad?  Old or young?
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
You haven't seen her yet?
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Oh, Leon!
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Those newspaper people?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.
Did you win?
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Hello, Leon!
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Unfortunately.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
Good morning.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
My jewels?!
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
How do you do, my friend.
