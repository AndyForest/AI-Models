Doing...?
You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Just came in.  She's still alive.
You can't.
It's a rip and a hit.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
Jos� Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Recruit us to do what?
It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
No part of it wasn't real.
No.
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
Yero, by himself?
...in the morning.
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
Of course.
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Hola, chica.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Twenty-eight-point-five.
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
Zero risk.
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
What do you mean?
Cost less.  That's the point.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
You know how improbable this is...?
Died in childbirth, having me...
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
No.
I dance...
Mojitas...?
How's he not your husband?
Your father?
Where's she now?
Were you born in Havana?
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
The Keys?
Where's that?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
It goes very fast.
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
Okay.
When?
I thought we had to meet the Man.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
What friend?
You got something to say, Jos�, let's hear it.
Yeah?
Packaging?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
Yeah.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Red light, green light, Jos�?
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
What...?
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
What's your take?
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
As in...?
We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in <i>The Miami Herald</i> to impress the slug farm in DC...
Hey, fuck him.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
We're makin' moves on each other.
No.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Verdado.
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
On my way back...
Nothing.
No.
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Who knows...
What do we got?
Port-Au-Prince.
Nothing.
Then it don't work.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
"No, viejo.  That was Jos� Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
Something's wrong.
Alonzo...
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
What's our deal?
Then you should.
Switek?
Go ahead.
Twenty on my man...
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
Never heard of him.
From whom...?
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
So what do you want?
How?
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Detective Crockett.
Hello?
How will it stand up?
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
Have faith.
How'd they get onto you?
Alonzo...!
Where are you?
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
I don't understand...
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
On the phone.
Yeah.
Yeah...?
