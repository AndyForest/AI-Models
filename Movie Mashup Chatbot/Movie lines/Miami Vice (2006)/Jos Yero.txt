'Cause she will tell you.
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
What'd Neptune tell you?
And what do I do with him?
I'll be there.
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
You afraid of violence?
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
Sit.
Josï¿½...
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
I had to lay eyes on you.
What do you care?
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Equipment?
Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
