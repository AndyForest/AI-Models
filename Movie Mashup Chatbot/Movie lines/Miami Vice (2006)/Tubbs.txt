Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
They'll kill Gina.
With Sonny.  110%.
Oh, yeah...
Sal Maguda.
"And" what?
I was the kids' godfather.
We know these people...!
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Yeah.
What's the point?  It's going down.
And Josï¿½, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
I would never doubt you.
I am asking.  You to me.
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
What is going on...?!
Chill out Sonny.
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Oh, that makes it okay, then.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
Havana, Cuba...?
Verdado where?
Where?
Where'd you go?
Where the hell are you, man?
How much we looking for?
Good.  So let's go...
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Like...?
To the limit.
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
Five minutes...
Where we meeting 'em...?
Anything?
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
What kind of weight?
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
So?
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
Stevens?
What is it?
Hello, Miss Ukraine...
And there's Dmitri...
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
C'mon, man!
Oh, good...
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
What's it say?
What flowers?
Okay...see you soon.
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
You sure?
You okay?
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
He did volunteer one time...
So?
Meaning...?
You set this up!
Conveyance?
And as an investment in the future...
Define small.
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
This the load you lost a while back?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
Then what were we talking to you for?
Do we need this...?
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
So lay it out, my brother...
They lied.
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
Alonzo...
What the hell did you do?
