I know.  And now?
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
If they attack you...
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
I'll be on board by noon.
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Is this the protective male talk?
Where would I go?
Would you find me...?
When?
Really?
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Do I need it?
Why?
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
What's the best fortune you ever got?
I forgot the napkins.
Hola, viejo.
Maybe I'm only one.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
Good samba dancing...?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Is it December?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Like...?
Exactly.
That's right.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
I insist.
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
Later!  Do you dance?
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
She's dead...
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Havana.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Show me...?
How fast does that go?
What do you like to drink?
And what is that?
What's "nothing"?
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
We want it back.
Right now.
You do.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
I think Jos� suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos� knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
That sonofabitch!
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
"Future" of...?
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
