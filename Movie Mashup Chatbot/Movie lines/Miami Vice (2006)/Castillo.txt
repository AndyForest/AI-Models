...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
He any good?
I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...
And...?
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
Grieve elsewhere.
Turn around.
What's your twenty?
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
What do you think?
Where's the new drop point...?
Yeah?
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Good.
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
Yes you do...
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Tell them what you want.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
