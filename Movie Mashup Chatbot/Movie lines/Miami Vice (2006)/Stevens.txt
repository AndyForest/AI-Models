Goodbye.
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know...
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
They had me from the gate.
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Where's Riccardo?
Sonny...?
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
What...?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
