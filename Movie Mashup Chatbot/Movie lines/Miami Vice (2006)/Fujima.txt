I got to talk to my ADO...
I don't know.
Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
Sure.
You need to consider a few issues.
They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
We're not certain!
We're not certain...
Control your men.
Out of...?
What are you talking about?
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
To recruit you.
We don't know.
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
That's right.
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Okay.  What's up?
What's your Miami PD badge number?
This is Agent James Fujima.
Who are you talking to?
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
White supremacist types.
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
