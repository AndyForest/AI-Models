I had no idea you'd be this good!
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Aged eighteen years.  Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
All right, I got some scotch.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Pardon me?
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
