I'll see you tomorrow.
Doctor King is my favorite.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Okay.
I'm in the bath, mom.
Those are my letters!
Where did you find those?
What are the boys like?
Cool.
It's like a secret society.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
I am?
I did?
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
What do I do then?
If that's what you call it.
No.
Well... not exactly.
I don't know.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
I... I don't think you want to know.
Something awful happened last night.
Who is it?
Best friends.
You'd do that for me?
Why?
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
Okay.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
I don't know.
No.
Is it that obvious?
What are you saying?
That was cool.
Okay.
It was nothing.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
Are you for real?
Eww. No. That's gross.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
What was that?
Prude.
Want a blow job?
Need any company?
Where are you going?
Is it me?
I'm sorry.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Am I suppose to be this sore?
Want to join me?
But -
What are you doing?
Just a kiss, right?
And then I can go home?
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
I look terrible.
What are you doing?
You think he'll like it?
But I thought high school is only four years.
What year are you in?
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
