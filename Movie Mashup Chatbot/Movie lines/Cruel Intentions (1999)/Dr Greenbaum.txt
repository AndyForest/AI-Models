Would you please leave.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
My daughter, Rachel.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
No. This is going to be our last session.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Don't you want to change that?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Who told you?
Honey, is something wrong?
