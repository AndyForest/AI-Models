Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
It's the least I can do.
Let me get that for you.
Absolutely.
I can't thank you enough.
Black.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
What about her?
Not at all. What's wrong?
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
That's beautiful.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
Is that so?
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
