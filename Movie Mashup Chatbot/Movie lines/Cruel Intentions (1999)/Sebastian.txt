What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
Why aren't you understanding?
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Sure.
Hi.
It was perfect.
Hi.
Get off me.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
Good for you.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
I just came to say goodbye.
Yes.
Why can't we be together?
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Because I'm in love with you.
You know what? I don't take it back.
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Am I bothering you?
No.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
I do not.
I can't win with you.
Yes it does.
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
I don't.
I do.
What?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
Need any company?
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
I will.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Of Human Bondage.
Reading.
Okay?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
How was your date?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
What?
Without question.
Yes.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Doing what?
How about tonight?
Who?
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I said I was sorry.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
How are you today?
Need a lift?
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
It's my house.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
Why not?
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
You implied it.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
Refreshing.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Give me the fucking letter.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
What? Another letter from your friend?
Thank you.
Please.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
That's a matter of opinion.
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Great book.
What'cha reading?
You talking to me?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
How do you know I've been with several women?
Oh really?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
I read your teen beat manifesto.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
You a lesbo?
Why not?
Got a boyfriend back home?
So what year are you going into?
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
Outstanding.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Are you shitting me?
What do you mean?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
The football stud?
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Good night Cecile.
No.
I'm taking a shower.
No, you were fine.
You think?
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Some other time, Cecile.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
You promised to let me kiss you.
I swear.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
I was just kidding.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
Just taking your photo.
He'll love it.
Excellent.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Yummy.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
You do?
It works a little.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Same time next week?
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
I do.
I know.
I know.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
One.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
Where is she?!
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Is she with you?
I'll be in touch.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
And you think she bought it?
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
You told her I never said I love you before?
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Whoa!
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Baby?  Right on time.
War it is.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
Will you calm down?
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
Come again?
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
Ronald?
I thought we should celebrate.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I have a flair for drama.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
I've never done this before.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
No, I'm not.
And I don't.
It clearly is why.
I'm not in the mood.
Some other time.
Mock, mock, mock.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
It was... Fantastic.
Oh yes.
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
Bad time?
Where'd she go?
Where is she?
A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Exactly the opposite.
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
With who?
Morning.
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Nothing.
Shut up.
Yeah.
Take a look for yourself.
Yippy.
You amaze me.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
Who are you calling?
Any day now.
Moving along quite well.
I hate it too.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
I'm at your service.
But who will they turn to for help?
What's your plan of attack?
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
You would not believe what--
Okay.
Blow me.
I'm working on it.
Even there?
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Be more specific.
And if I win?
What are the terms?
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Care to make a wager on that?
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Sounds intriguing.
I see your point... though why should I care?
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
You don't mean?
Sorry.
What?
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Outstanding.
It's really important.
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
Annette! Annette!
Do you know when she'll be back?
Do you know where she is?
I need to talk to Annette.
Well please leave a message that I called.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
I said, do you want some water?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Right after we played backgammon.
Yes, you already did.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Did she show up?
What time is it?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
What are you talking about?
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Hey Ronald.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
You're a lucky guy.
