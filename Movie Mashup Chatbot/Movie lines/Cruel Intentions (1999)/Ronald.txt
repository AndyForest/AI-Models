Absolutely.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Racist piece of shit.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
I'll be right there.
What do you mean?
What's wrong?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
Yeah?
Hello.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Pleased to meet you.
I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Excuse me.
You bastard!
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
Did you hit her?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
How will I get to her?
She really loves me.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
