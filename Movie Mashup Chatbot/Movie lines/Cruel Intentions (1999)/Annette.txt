I know.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
I have his journal.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
You heard me.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Thank you.
I'll be fine.
That's right.
You might say that.
I don't think so.
Annette Harrison.
Okay...
You promise not to say anything?
Forever.
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
What do you mean?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Nothing.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
But you knew this was important to me.
You don't know how to love.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
I love you.
What are you saying?
Yeah, me neither.
Would you like a tour?
Hi.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
Hi.
Please don't go.
How am I a hypocrite?
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
I think that's for the best.
Where are you going?
It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
You really want to know?
That's not fair.
I have feelings for you.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Why are you doing this?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Not at all. Have a seat.
No?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Fine.
Lighten up.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
You must take me for a real idiot.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
Oh please.
Okay.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Sure. Have a good night.
You're not gonna start that again.
Somerset Maugham.
What are you reading?
What are you doing?
Wait, don't hang up.
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
I'm... I'm alright.
No, not at all.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
And you promise to abide by it?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
That's also none of your business.
I'm busy.
That's none of your business.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
You don't even know me.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
And that's a bad thing?
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
It was fine.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Give it up.
No thank you.
That's repulsive.
You're naked.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
Because you act like a pig.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Shut up.
Thank you.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
I never said that.
About what?
How's the water?
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
I sincerely doubt it.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
At this hour? I don't think so.
You need help.
Romantic? He rapes her.
You've read The Fountainhead?
The Fountainhead.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Why are you being so dramatic?
It's not really important.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
A friend wrote me.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
You did?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
No.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
No.
Junior.
German.
Ben Schwarz.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
