On my mother's life.
Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
Annette, how long have we known each other?
From who?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
I told you I don't know.
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
No.
Who is this?
She bought it.
I'm pretty sure she did.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes.
Positive.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
I told you to lock the door.
Get out of here.
Jesus!
Oh baby... oh baby...
