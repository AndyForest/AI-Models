I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Hi, mom.
