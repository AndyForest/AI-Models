I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
I don't think that bothered him.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Greg McConnell.
Where did you say she's from?
Any ideas who it could be?
