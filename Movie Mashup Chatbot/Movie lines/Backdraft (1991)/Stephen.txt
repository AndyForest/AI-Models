You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
-- Knock it off!
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
We're gonna be okay, man...
Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
No.  I need a drink.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Be gentle.
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Shut up!
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
I'll handle it.
Anything else?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
I know.
-- What are you doing here?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
Everybody did.
Saw what?
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
So hello.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Fuck you.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
...Not now, Brian.
Brian, look --
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
You okay?
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
Ready?
Roll the hose.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Roll the hose.
Yeah... too bright...
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Hey.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
Ya love it, probie?
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Thanks for the speakers.
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
Why'd you come here, Brian?
That was never proved.
Sheep don't count.
People actually used to pay you for this?
It works.
What, you've never seen one before?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
It doesn't go like that.
Dad!
Firehouse.
Fireman shit?
And DIE!
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
I'll be there.
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
I'm busy.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
He's out.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
I treated you better.
He treats you okay?
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Where's Sean?
Fixing my roof.
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
It knows us. This one knows us.
You don't know... nobody knows...
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
I'm working on it.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
Got a cause?
