Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
No need to be modest, Brian.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
I'm a little busy right now --
Investigator...
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Don't you have any leads at all?
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
Inspector.
Investigator Rimgale.
