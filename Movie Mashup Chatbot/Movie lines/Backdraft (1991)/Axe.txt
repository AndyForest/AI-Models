Stevie... I...
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
Biggest in two battalions.
Yeah...
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Wash it to the windows?
Oh these moments do try me...
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
You gotta let me finish --
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
He's alive.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
