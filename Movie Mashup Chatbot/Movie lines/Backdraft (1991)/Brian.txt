-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
-- He killed people --
Just come down, John. Just --
Did you do it for Tim?
Is he...
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
What are we going to do about this?
-- What were they doing there?
How do you know?
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
I saw it.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
You're selling dad's boat?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Just leave me alone, okay?
Thanks for the insight.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
What, are you kidding? By myself?
This?
C'mon, let's crawl home.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Hey.
Thanks.
-- Never mind.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Goddamn it Stephen!
-- C'mon, Stephen.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Hey! You don't know me --
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Yeah? What about Laura --
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
In the Field Museum once.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
Been ripping off fire stations?
I like what you've done with the place.
Not likely.
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Who asked you?
I'll see ya around, huh?
What'll you do?
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What is --
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Yes.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Hi.
-- I work for the city.
Leave Stephen out of this --
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
I wanted to be a good one.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
Thanks for the invite.
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Okay.
Well, you did invite me here.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Hey.
Arson.
Yeah...
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
With grenadine, right?
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Really? No kidding.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
You look great.
Jennifer.
Oh Jesus Christ...
Who the fuck is doing this?
Trychticholorate.
The outlets.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
What?
I don't have a story.
Then who --
Who's doing this?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Hey, do I know you?
See you Monday. Sir.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
I need another one, sir.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
I want another shot, Sir.
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
Like it never happened...
Yeah.
So what do you want me to do?
Just wondering.
Did I say thanks?
Did you pull me out?
How ya feeling?
Then who wrote the report?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Yeah? Airtight?
Nice bunch of guys.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
Fire.
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
Are you going public with this?
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
What reason?
But he killed these guys.
What?
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
But the right guess on this is arson.
And the putty around the door?
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
No it couldn't.
-- Another backdraft.
Glass?
What are you listening to?
Where are you going?
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Four months.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Nice boat.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
I have a job.
Every little boy's fantasy.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Yeah. Big fan.
Swayzak's not my boss.
So, you surviving without me?
What?
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
Do you have to do that?
Backdraft.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Engine 115, right?
Completely out of control.
I was ahead of my time.
Coffee sucked.
Management were pin heads.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
It's in my blood, Willy.
