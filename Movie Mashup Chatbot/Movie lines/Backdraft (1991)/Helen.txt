You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Four months?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
You look like... Brian.
Brian?
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
What's wrong?
You can't keep being his father...
Yeah? When was the last time?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
You want some coffee?
You treated me like shit.
Okay.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
The great communicator.
-- You remember.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
He's going to be a fireman.
He's got piano lessons.
It's not your roof anymore.
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Here we go...
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
