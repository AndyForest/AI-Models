Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
Sure you do.
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
-- Burn it all.
-- Burn them.
-- Burn them.
Absolutely.
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Tell him about me, Shadow?
I know you.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Who's this?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Shadow.
