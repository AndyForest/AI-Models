Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
I've always thought that myself.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Oh?
One or two?
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Oh Frederick.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
More romances for John?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
And here are my mother and father.
Do you?
Well, these things take time.
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
What do you mean?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Did it go well, darling?
You won't be long?
