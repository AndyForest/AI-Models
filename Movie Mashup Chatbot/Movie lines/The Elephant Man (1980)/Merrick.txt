If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Oh, yes.
They have noble faces.
How lovely.
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
Two, please.
Yes please, two.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
...everyone has been very kind.
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
I feel much better. Thank you.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Oh no?
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
No, but I certainly shall.
Romance!
Tell me about it, please!
Alas, no.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Yes.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Oh, no.
Good day...!
Oh, yes.
Oh no, my friend...
Yes.
You're English.
y-y-yes--
I'll have to find some more.
...I learned a long time ago.
The main spire.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Thank you... very much.
Yes.
Good morning.
No, nothing.
Thank you very much.
Yes.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Yes, very soon.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
My home.
Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
You did this for me?
...my... home?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
I thought as much.
...Can you cure me?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Good morning.
Here.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
The Children. Where are your children
The children! May I see?
Who are they of?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Ohhh...
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Thank you very much.
How long will I stay here?
The hospital?
This... is my new home?
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
You did not ask me.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
