Welcome home, John.
Well...
A dressing bag?
Very smart indeed.
Yes sir.  What's that?
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Watery headed bunch.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Won't come out, eh?
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
The workhouse.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
I've heard.
Fine.
