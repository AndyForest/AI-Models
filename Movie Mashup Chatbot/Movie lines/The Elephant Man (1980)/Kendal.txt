Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Have you read it?
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
You've never been?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
She's very pretty, your mother.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Is he... dying then?
How awful for John.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
