Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
What's this?
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Where did you get this box?
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
