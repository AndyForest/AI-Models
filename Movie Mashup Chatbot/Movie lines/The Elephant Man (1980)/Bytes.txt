Shut up!
I'll show you! I'll show you!
If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
Right... Right.
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
I want him back!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
Never mind that, I want my man!
I want my man back.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
He fell.  He falls.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
