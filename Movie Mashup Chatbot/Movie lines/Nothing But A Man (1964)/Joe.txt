Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Been over to the other mill?
You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
How 'you doin' man?
Like hell they wouldn't.
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
