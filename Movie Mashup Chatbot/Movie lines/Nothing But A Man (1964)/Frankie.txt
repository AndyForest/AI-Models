You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
See Duff. He's the money man.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
'Got a good thing, man.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
What 'you signifyin'?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Like what?
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
I bet she's easy jam.
Just get her drunk.
What's so hot 'round town?
Where' you goin'?
What you gettin' all pretty for?
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
