They done that too long in my family.
Yeah.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
No thanks.
Out.
Give her a beer.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
All right, you get out of here, man!
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Fill her up?
What d'you think?
No. You got the wrong idea.
Well, what d'you know?!
Used to be. On the railroad.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Okay.
That's right.
Anderson.
Walker and Williams.
Yeah.
I know.
I'll smile when it's funny.
I said: Cut it out!
Where's he at?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Like where?
I been sendin' her money.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
Where's Wilma?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Guess I don't.
Thanks.
Okay.
Name's Duff.
Okay, thanks very much.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Well, he worked around.
I don't know.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Guess so.
Thanks.
Okay, I will.
That's two bucks, Joe.
Oh yeah? That's good.
Yeah, I been there.
Oh yeah?
Okay.
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
Okay.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Well, that'll be the first time.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
How come you don't hate their guts?
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
You heard me!
Watch out!
No point fixin' it!
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
What the hell could you do?
Yeah!
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Yeah.
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
How come you keep askin'?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
You jivin' me?
Huh?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Go on - hit me!
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
Uh-huh. Why?
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hmmm - good coffee.
What about them?
Everything you cook is good.
Come here, baby.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Is that so?
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
What about him?
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
Yeah?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
I can see why.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
How about it?
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Okay, I guess.
What?
I thought you wasn't comin'.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
Four.
I'll see you later.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Goin' to see my kid.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Ain't your fault.
Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
You almost got into trouble back there.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
Scared, huh?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
That's why you come back, huh?
How come you stay 'round here?
Take it easy.
Get out of here!
You got a problem all right.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
That's right.
Hell!
Go on - you can have one!
How about another beer?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Went to college, huh?
You work around town?
Yeah. On the section gang.
No. I'm new in town.
I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
Good-bye, Frankie.
That's right.
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Like a home, for one thing.
A whole lot, Frankie.
We was just leavin', fellows.
How 'bout the key?
Take it easy, Frankie.
'Round town.
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
'Bye, Jocko.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
Yeah, see you in hell.
Better get him to a hospital.
Take it easy, Pop.
That's right.
Great.
I heard you.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
No.
I said, I come to town with a girl.
What happened?
Okay.
Yeah. That's right.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wouldn't have known you.
I'm Duff.
'You Will Anderson?
I said, she's in great shape.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
She don't look no worse to me.
Sorry.
She'll do.
Okay.
No, thanks.
Okay.
Who is?!
Hell, I'm just like him.
Okay.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
No, they won't.
That's right.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Sure.
No thanks, Lee.
Come on, Pop.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
How often is that?
How often does he get like that?
Oh yeah?
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
So I been told.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
It ain't in me.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
I guess not.
I doubt it.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
I guess I ain't.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Thank you.
Guess it's never been easy.
How are you?
