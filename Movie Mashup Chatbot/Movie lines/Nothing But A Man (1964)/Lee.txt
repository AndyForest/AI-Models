Good-bye, Duff.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Don't be too hard on him.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
How 'you gonna live?
They'll run you out.
Going back, huh?
Well, what're you going to do?
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Come back some other time, will you?
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Let's go.
Right here.
What's the matter now?
Like hell you ain't!
Now you stay put!
He's your son.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Shut up, Will.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Let's stay here, Will.
No. Why?
Come on, Will.
Hi.
