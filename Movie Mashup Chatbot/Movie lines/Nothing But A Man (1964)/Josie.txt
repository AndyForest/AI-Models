Duff--
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
I don't think that'll happen.
Where're you going to go?
There's nothing to say.
Duff, I love you.
What d'you mean?
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Don't do that!
What're you going to do?
Day work.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
About ten dollars.
Hi.
We can always do that, Duff.
They won't.
You will.
Don't deny me, Duff.
Don't, Duff.
I keep thinking about him.
What about your boy?
We'll be all right.
Well, I haven't come around.
Don't look so scared.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
I don't want to hurt you.
My kids want me to teach them.
You know how to box?
You still didn't answer my question.
You didn't answer my question.
Am I as good as they?
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
What's wrong?
Yeah, that's so.
He could live with us.
Don't call them that.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Well, what d'you think?
No. But a small one.
What about that girl?
Don't push me, Duff.
What happened, Duff?
Thank you.
What d'you mean?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Your boy.
How did it go?
Hi.
What's he like?
How old is your boy?
Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
That's right.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Surprised?
Are you married?
I didn't know you had one.
Just for the day?
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
What d'you mean?
That's the way he is.
No.
'Been up north?
Why did you?
Good night, Duff.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
What?
No, on the porch.
I wouldn't have let you.
What d'you mean?
But I would like to see you again.
Not here, Duff.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
Let's go, Duff.
Don't Duff--
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
How d'you mean?
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
They must work on the section gang.
What is it?
No thanks.
I like a place with lots of life.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
No.
How d'you mean?
What d'you expect?
Maybe.
That's right.
My father's the preacher.
Yes, aren't you?
Your folks live there?
In Birmingham.
I'm a teacher.
Oh yeah?
You working?
Haven't seen you around, have I?
You must be new in town.
