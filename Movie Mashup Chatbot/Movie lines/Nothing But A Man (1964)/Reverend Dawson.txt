I'll be seeing you.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
It's for your own good.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
All right, son.
Hello.
That'll make the folks very happy.
I know.
I understand.
