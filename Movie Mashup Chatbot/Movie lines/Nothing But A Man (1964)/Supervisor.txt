Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
Want to keep your job, boy?
All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
You a union man?
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Want to talk to you.
'You Duff Anderson?
