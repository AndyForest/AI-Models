Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
Couldn't get the words out before.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
Beat it!
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
I asked you somethin', boy!
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
'Don't sound so sure.
Plannin' on getting married?
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
How about a drink?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
What's on your mind?
Wouldn't have known you.
Who're you?
Anything you say, baby.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Got a thick feelin' here.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Okay, boy, beat it.
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
He's my son!
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
