You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
We have to talk.
Not anymore.
I'm wasting time.
Where?
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
Remember my promise.
I want to stop aging.
I'm not voting for you.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
Out of the room.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
Give it to me.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
What's this?
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I'm not on the force anymore.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
You should be in hospital.
No you don't.
I'm signing off.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
You okay?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
Yeah.
Not yet.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
You treat her nice.
Sanchez...?
We're partners, aren't we?
Not too good.
How ya feeling?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
What else did he get?
You're not pregnant, are you?
Wanna try?
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Then find me some cigarettes.
You want to be a good detective?
Hey, I'm eating.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
Good night.
I'll be okay.
She's pretty.
Yeah.
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
Married?
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
I was set up.
Drop it.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
Hey, buddy...
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Yes.
Pass.
Wanna come?
I'm not fond of television comedies.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
Some things never change.
They're going to rob that bank.
See those guys?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
I have to go home, Sanchez.
Lean year for role models.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
Does it drive itself, too?
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
I'm ready.
I drive.
Well, that's good enough for me.
Are you a cop?
You my partner?
Remember, get the seat fixed.
Good to know you, Willy.
What's your name?
Yes.
Seat's too high.
You all right?
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
This little thing says I can't.
Hi.
