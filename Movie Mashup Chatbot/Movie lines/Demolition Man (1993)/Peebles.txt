Sir---
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
Aces.
You okay?
Sir, your limo's here.
I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
