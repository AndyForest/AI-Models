Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Yeah?
I want this bastard brought down.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
I can smell it.
Technothugs?
What'cha got, Bennett?
I don't want to hear anymore.
You're crazy.
What are you talking about?
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
And I want Doucet.
Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I'll be alright.
Hello Wade.
You're working a partner on this.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
When you bring in Doucet.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
Mug sheets.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Kill him... kill him.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
Just great.
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Shut up!  Drop it.
Keep 'em busy.
How do I look?
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Fine.
