Put that on your political resume.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Speak up.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Funny guy.
I want to ask you a few questions.
My man Dubbs.
Avon Lady!
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
He could be brought back.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
And you should be with your family.
No.  I want to be with you.
You be careful.
I just heard.
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
Hospital food.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
...Have you been drinking?
...What are you talking about...?
I'm here.
What's this?
How do I look?
Rip Van Winkle.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
Simulated one.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
No, sir.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Yes, sir.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
Good night, Wade.
You need anything else?
Thanks.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
What's this place?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Why?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
How then?
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
Relax, let technology do the work.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
Can I ask you something?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
My insurance won't cover it.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
I'll inform dispatch.
How do you know?
Technothugs.
Doucet killed my partner.
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
But Sergeant...
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
Yes.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
But he was such a good cop.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
Take a look at this.
What's it mean?
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
This is the guy that killed my partner.
