Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
How big is this horse?
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
Now: I'm looking at the...
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
You do...?
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
Joe, the writer?
<u>Bobby</u>...
Are you Okay?
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
You can go...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
What...
She's a...
We've got three days to...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
What else?
What's his name?
Izzat so?
Aren't you ever in school?
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
Marty...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
...yes...
I know...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
An artist of your caliber...
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
And you know what...?
...wants a piece...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
I know, I know.
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
...I know...I know...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
Who are these from?
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
I know that...
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
You can't do what?
What...?
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
Yes, yes, but...
Yeah.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
This is Joe White.
No, no...Please.
We're just talking about the...
Claire, Bob Bar...
Claire, when did you...
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
That's cor...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.
Why not?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Did she throw up?
You show Claire these sketches?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
Not now.
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
Then you're finished in show business.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
No, what is it?
I treated you like a son or nephew.
I don't getcha.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
Get a typist.  Gettim a typist.  Get outta here.
Why?
Why?
Where have you been...?
Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
I know you do.
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
Grace.  Get Mr. White a manual typewriter.  It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.
Grace...
I know the feeling.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
We're out of money.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
Do something.
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
She wasn't in...you were al...
He's got a gift for fiction.
Is that one hell of a kid?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
<u>Find</u> it.
Pay her off.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
Find the money.
<u>Pay</u> her.
It's just a formality.
Marty...
Like dykes and dogs.
That's what I said.
I'm gonna' bring it off.
What's in all the bags?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
How was your flight?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
I left that for you.
So we just got lucky.
George, that is so kind of you.
...it is?
...the city council...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
Why would they be illegal?
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
Why?
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
...we can't lose the wind...
Givvem a cigarette...
