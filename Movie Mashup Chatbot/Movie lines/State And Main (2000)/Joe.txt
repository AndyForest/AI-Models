If I go to jail...?
I'm going to tell the truth.
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
But it'll stop the movie.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
What am I gonna do?
I saw...
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
Well ain't you amazing.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
...and we could get up every morning...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Yeah, you?
Good morning.
Pelting down out there.
You know what else a man can do?
You'd do the newspaper right here.
It does?
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Gosh, you look nice.
I'd love to.
Is it...
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
I told them what you said about the script...
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
Where you going?
Hi.
...take <u>any</u> two people...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
<u>Please</u>...
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
It used to be the Old Mill.
I can't get it to come out right.
Yes.
Why?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
But it's absurd.
You believe that?
Because I'd met someone else.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Later on.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Why?
Oh.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Thank you.
Hi.
One moment.
I don't drink.
Oh, God...
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
Would you go in...
Great.  Who is it...?
Gonna' be good as new.
Fix my glasses.
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
You like kids?
You got a paperclip?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
What?
Uh huh.
What happened?
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
I thought you had Play Practice.
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Yes.
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
No, I don't...
<u>How</u>...?
I...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
About <u>conflict</u>...
What I need to <u>say</u>...
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
I <u>can</u>?
How can you <u>say</u> that?
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
Hi.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
...that.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
...such a pleasant sound.
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Goodbye.
And likewise.
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
That: in an act of...
But, but but but...
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
That's true.  You grow up here?
But why the dalmation?
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
It's...
I...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
Why?
You like my play.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
I quit the movie.
I quit.
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
"Anguish."
You haven't heard of it.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
Well, it had sentimental value.
The people in New Hampshire.
I have one, but they lost it.
I want to rent this one.
I need a typewritter.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
Well, where do they hold court?
What?
Courthouse back in town.
They know what her tits look like.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Hi.
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Will you help me out...?
That's my...
You have to hide.
Look, look there's someone else...
But not that <u>way</u>...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
Look.
Why?
I, actually yes.
She's absolutely r...
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
For what cause?
So be it.
The girl was in the car.
I have to tell the truth.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
The girl was in the car.
I'm out.
You want me to lie.
I've got a date.
I'm gonna nail it.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
I hurt my finger.
I can't.
What's the...
I don't drink.
Um, no.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
I want to make a good film.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I grew up on your mov...
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
I can only write on a manual.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
I...
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
I don't...
I don't know.
I didn't say anything to them.
No.
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
I can write it.  I can't type it.
I...
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
Hi!
