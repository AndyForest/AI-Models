But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
We have to lose the window.
Where are we?
