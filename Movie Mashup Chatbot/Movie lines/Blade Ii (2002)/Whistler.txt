Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Your security's for shit, kid.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I'll show you.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I don't like it.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
Sounds like a plan.
Either that or feeding the worms.
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
Took you long enough.
You came back for me.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
What the fuck you doing?
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
Getting your attention, Paco.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
What about you?  You're not coming?
Pretty.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
Going on twenty years now.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Tell me something, Skid --
