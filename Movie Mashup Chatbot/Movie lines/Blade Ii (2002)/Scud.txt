So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Nomak?
What's going on?
So you're going to do this?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
I don't know about this, man --
You got something in mind, Blade?
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Look, what's your problem?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Scud.
