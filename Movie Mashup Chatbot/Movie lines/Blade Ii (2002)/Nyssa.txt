I want to see the sun rise.
How does it look?
I don't understand.
You're hurting me.
Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
Why do you hate us so much?
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Why?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Thank you.
Anyone else make it?

Blade.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Minutes.
I didn't know.
What about Nomak?
You're hurt.
What was that?
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
The House of Pain.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
Two years.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
Survival.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
Maybe it's better that way.
We're locked in.
You experimented on your own, son?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
His name is Jared Nomak.
