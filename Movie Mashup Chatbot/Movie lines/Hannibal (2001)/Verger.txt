OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
Have the child taken to bed.
Show me the Pigs.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would <u>Meddle</u> with it...?  <u>No</u>, on the <u>other</u> hand...
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
Where was the call from.
<u>Do</u> it...
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Why did he come back?
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>?
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
Yes.... yes...
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
Where do you live?
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
Is it necessary to know?
...tell them...
Make them eat the figurine.
...when I...
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS!
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
You're <u>free</u>...
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
Why should <u>you</u> care?
Thank you, Cordell.
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
My encounter.
Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Because?
Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
