Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
I <u>swear</u> to you...
...I was <u>working</u>...
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
They're offering...
Some museum director disappeared.
I'm going to tell you later....
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
...you don't have to think.
Aren't you glad to see me?
...would you excuse me...?
...his family has offered a large reward.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
That's why my wife adores me.
First things first.
Hold up a minute...
...what a world.
...are they hard to get?
What else did I miss...?
They got that kind of money?
Yeah, so where is he?
What's up...?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
I require...
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
...long overdue.
I've left my <u>program</u>...
Who does not?
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
Darling...
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
You know America?
How could you know?
And?  Then?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
Yes.  How did you know?
How so?
...your <u>scar</u>..?
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
Why did you look at me that way?
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
I'll have them picked up.
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
Ask me when we get home.
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
"Because we don't have any money."
Because...?
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
...what do you expect me to...
I am on the track of...
...my love...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
I don't understand.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
Fine, thank you, but
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
The shape of a Three.
I want the money.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar.
I know where he is.
I know where he is.
Hello....?
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
...but:  this particular statue...
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
I know it well.
...what a lovely perfume.
Thank you.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling...
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
...<u>sadly</u>...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
Brazilian.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
What're they on about?
...yes, yes, yes....
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
...I feel that...
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
