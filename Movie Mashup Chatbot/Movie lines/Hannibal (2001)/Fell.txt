And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
...how so?
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
...should love to correct your error.
I have had many excellent meals there.
A wonderful country...

No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
I have had the honor.
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.

I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy.
I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but <u>clean</u>.  Just dressed--in the middle of the...
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?--
