And have <u>you</u> found Peace..?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Rich, comic book freaks.
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you...
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
We could skip the Gavotte.
That would adversely impact my income.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
...why?
...very good.
Why me?
Yes?
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Orderly.
It's a growth business.
Or, perhaps...
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
