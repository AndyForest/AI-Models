When?
...yes...?
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
...yes...?
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today...
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?"
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
...would you use a small word?
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
What does <u>that</u> mean?
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Then what brings you back?
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
Then tell me.
Tell me why...?
