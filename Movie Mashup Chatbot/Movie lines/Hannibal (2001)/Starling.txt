Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Who would that be.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
...they did it for a lark.
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
You want me to be?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
Then who's buying it?
Say it in English.
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
I'm looking for...
...you...
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
What have they got you doing?
...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
It wasn't my day.
Well.  Word gets around.
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
I have not read you your rights.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
What, What, I can't hear you...
I know her by the Back.
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
Then I'm doing fine.
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
How <u>crazy</u> is that....
How crazy is that.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're...
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Then you tell me, then.
I'm not.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>...
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
No, no, of course not.
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
And how would you know that?
He is...?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
What reaction?
Now, why in the world would he do that?
What would <u>that</u> be?
I won't take much of his time.
I've never heard that he...
The children...?
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
I know you did what you could.
I am all attention.
Yes sir, I saw it.
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
Am I on that case, sir...?
...standard issue...
...what'm I looking at...?
You seen John Brigham...?
He once made me an improper suggestion.
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ï¿½our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Sir:
Give it up.
Give it up, Evelda.
Waal...
I said how's your baby...?
How's your <u>child</u>?
I said sometime it gets so...
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
I'm an orphan.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning.
...may be the heat....
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
Sir, with all due respect....
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
And how did he do that?
...and my need for The Institution...
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
What is that that smells so wonderful.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
Give me your gun...
Why?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
No.
...what...?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
No.  I want to buy a dog.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
...not to turn around.
I am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>!
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
Oh baby, oh baby....
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
Or clear your windshield with it.
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.
Hey, lost again.
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
...why?
Yes.
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
I..
What is your point?
Yes.
That's right.
I don't understand.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"--
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
Yes.
For approval.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
Yes.
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but...
...no.
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
...no...
...no...
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
....that's right.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
...sir...?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
