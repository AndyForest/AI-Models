No sweat.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
What, then?
Deep, real deep.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
What?
Digital laser readers.
That's all there is.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
To Wilson.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You were how long on this?
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Cool ropes.
This stinks really bad.
How about we go somewhere else?
Hello.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
You're fucking dead!
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
Hello?
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
We're on.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
I'm touched.
But I might not have.
It was fifteen minutes late.
How'd it go?
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
