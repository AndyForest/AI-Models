You can't make it.
Then we've just got shit.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
You are.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Yeah, sure, what?
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
Die tomorrow or die today.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
What are you doing?
You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
Water water water --
Get water!
You're putting off the inevitable.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
No.
No.
No more water, you said.
Going to die anyway.
Do too much, I'll die.
No water, no work.
Thirsty.
Can't.  Need water.
Feels so good to lie here.
With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Catch another fish tomorrow.
