I'm so glad you're alive.
I love you, Chuck.
I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
What will you do?
You okay?
This is so unfair.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
Come on.  Try.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Yeah?
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What's that, written on the sail?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that?
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
Her name's Hannah.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
If I'd known you were alive --
I would never --
I got married.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
Get back?  From where?
Don't even start.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
I burned the Christmas tree.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
There isn't any us.
That's your dog.
No.
"We're" not over-reacting.
This isn't working out.
You want to.
You can't go now.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
For when I travel?
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
He's your cute thing.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
Let me guess, Russia came up?
You don't seem too happy about it.
Merry Christmas eve.
Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
Chuck.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
How was Russia?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Sonofabitch!
