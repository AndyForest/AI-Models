The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Worse than Warsaw.
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Sure.
No.  that was the last one.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Well, not really, I --
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
Well, I do a little drawing --
They're harder to do than they look.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Okay.  Sure.
As much as anybody.
No.
There was an unavoidable delay.
So do I.
Yeah, a long one.
I had it on the island with me.
Had a package to deliver.
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
You too.
It means a lot...that you came.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
Great.  Really.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
Not when you have no choice.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
That about sums it up.
What was inside?
There was a coffin?
My epitaph.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Is that Jango?
You have any children?
I would have done the same thing.
I know.
I thought you might have.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Yes there is.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
I can't take him to work.
Could you watch Jango?
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
I have to.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
You did?
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
You know, for when you travel.
And for you --
I can't even keep fish alive.
He is a cute thing.
Hey, look at you.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
Four four.  A record.
Not if you work for FedEx.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Got to follow the paper path here.
I thought I did.
Cold.
Let's take a look.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
Anything else?
When's the next Jumbo?
Terrific.  Yours?
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
Not to mention on me.
Yes, yes he did.
I most definitely say I am.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
I am one lucky guy.
Which I didn't have.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Yeah.
Sure.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
No.
Need some help?
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
Really?
True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
But chickens?
So did I.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
I wanted to come here.
When'd you start working here?
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
The place is falling apart.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Mom, meet Jango.
Can you find her?
What about the sender?
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
What's going on down there?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Thanks.  For everything.
I need to do it.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
That's what it's about.
Take your time.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
Believe me I know.
To life.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Hallelujah.
To Wilson.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
Forty-three days.
Time I had lots of.
I braided them.
You should have smelled me.
Want to see my raft?
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
I beat the odds!
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
It's me.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
You are one sick fucker.
For the third time.
That's why you're a gambling man.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
Forget it.
And never take.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
Baloney.  I do see the damn "big picture."
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
I was making a point.
You fucked us over.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
You what?
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Permission to come aboard, sir.
