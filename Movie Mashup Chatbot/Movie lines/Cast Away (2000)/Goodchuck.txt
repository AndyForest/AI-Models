Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
It's real.
Jesus.
What's so damn funny?
Shut up.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
They're on autopilot.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
No!
Why do they have to die for me?
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
Fix raft first.
I'm putting it off.
Moon's too bright.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
Survive today, that's the point.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Take it, damn it.
Take it.
Do too little you'll die.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
You've had today's water.
Get up, damn you.
Get up.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Save some for tomorrow.
