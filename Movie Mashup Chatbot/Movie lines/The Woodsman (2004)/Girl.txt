Robin.
What does that mean?
I'm not pretty.
I have friends.
It's my bird book.
See anything interesting?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
I have to go.
Were you watching me?
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
You should hear the bird.
Something like that.
It's a bright sound.
I can't.
It's hard to describe.
Their sound is quite musical.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
I don't like starlings.
They're starlings.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
There's a million birds here.
What are you looking at?
