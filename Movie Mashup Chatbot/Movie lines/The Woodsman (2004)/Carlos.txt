What do you mean?
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Sure.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
I'm just talking, man.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
Don't talk like that.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
It's not what you think.
C'mon, Walter.
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
Early July.
Soon.
Aren't you glad?
Annette will see you.
I've got some good news.
Ah, come on.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
What party?
Fucking Mariners.
What's happening?
I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
It wasn't like that.
You need a table.
It was a beautiful present.
Yeah. It's really nice.
It's a nice table.
Huh?
This little table is one heavy bitch.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
I'm working on it.
Annette? She's good... tense.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
What?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
Hey, is that a school?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
Five years.
Foreman now.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
You doing okay?
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
