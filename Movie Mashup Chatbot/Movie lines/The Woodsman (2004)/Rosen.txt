How do you feel about that?
It's going to take time, Walter.
Accept you?
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
I meant later... when you two took naps.
Did you get an erection?
You felt pleasure.
What else?
I'm only asking questions.
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
All right.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
A nap?
And what are you doing?
But roughly, how old?
How old are you and your sister?
Where are you?
Where?
Sorry.  Where is she?
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
Who do you see?
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
No, I am not going to --
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
To relax.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
That's not a helpful answer.
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
When did it all start?
I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
Please don't do it again.
You're very late.
Go home, Walter.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
I want you to calm down.
Is this the first one?
What did you want to happen?
What did you think would happen?
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
I know --
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
What is your idea of being normal?
They usually tell me.
I don't.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
I'm afraid not.
I couldn't say.
We have a lot of work to do.
We have a few more minutes.
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
Is that what you are angry about?
Why do you think you're here?
Do you think you're crazy?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
What are you afraid will happen?
Then why are you talking about this?
You have no feelings for your niece?
How do you feel about that?
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
You don't like coming here, do you?
I wish you'd give it a try.
How's the journal?
Then think about it.
Try it.
By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
It's very good, indeed.
That's right.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
It was just an idea.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
I don't understand.
Why not?
That's right.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
You seem a little hostile today.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
And how's your job?
