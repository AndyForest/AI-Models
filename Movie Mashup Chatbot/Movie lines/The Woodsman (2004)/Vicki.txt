If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Have you seen Walter?
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Why's that?
What?
Not when they fly.
Fucking liar.
You okay?
Do you want to talk about it?
What's going on?
What's your fucking problem?
Do what?
Prove it.
Don't be scared, Walter.
You're such an asshole.
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
What's it look like?
Fine.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Who doesn't?
Just think about it.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Move in with me.
We should live together.
Neither am I.
You're scared.
What?
Not ever.
Are you serious?
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
I love my brothers.
All three -- in chronological order.
I got poked around... here and there.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
What odds?
I know.
What?
Bullshit.
And what do you tell yourself now?
You really believe that?
They seduce you?
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
Why young girls, Walter?
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
I'm sorry, Walter.
You mean the time you're locked away?
Yes! I want to know.
What was prison like?
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
Walter.
Hey, I'm not --
What?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Twelve years in prison?
How young?
What did you do to them?
How many girls did you molest?
You're not joking.
Molested little girls?
So, what did you do?
The worst?
Because I like you.
Hey, there.
I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
Is that all?
Did I say something wrong?
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
I thought I'd stay the night.
How about in the morning.
Tell me about it.
Since you've had sex?
Do you?
What's the problem?
No you're not.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Hey, that was... intense.
Not tonight.
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
So?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
So... what's your dark secret?
I'm not easily shocked.
Something happened to you.
You're damaged.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Yeah, they could.
What about them?
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
Doesn't it get noisy?
Is that a school?
You plan to drink both those beers?
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
Southern light.
What do you think?
You never spoke to me before.
They're all assholes.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
You're quiet at work.
Guess I'm not like most women.
What's weird about that?
Very weird.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
Yeah, you.
I'm talking about you.
There's something wrong with this picture.
It's fucking freezing out here.
Want a ride?
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
What?
