Will I see you again?
Can't I stay a little longer?
I don't mind.
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
Walter?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
How do you know?
But will he... ?
What will happen if I do?
I can't.
Ms. Kramer.
Yes.
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
They sound like finches.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
No thank you.
What?
Yes?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
It sounds like you were banished.
How come?
Do you have many friends?
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
I'm twelve.
Yeah, like the bird.
