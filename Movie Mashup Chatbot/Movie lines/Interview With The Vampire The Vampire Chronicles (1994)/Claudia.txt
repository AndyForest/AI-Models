I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
Don't Louis --
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
No. Laudanum.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Does it?
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
You made us what we are, didn't you?
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
And if I cut my hair again?
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Is this my birthday?
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
Why always on this night?
I'm not your daughter.
I want some more.
More.
What do you mean?
But if she dies...
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
You really believe that?
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
Love?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
Be still!
Yes, and very beautiful.
And no one knows but us...
She's no vampire.
How devilishly clever.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Or her, or her - or any of them?
But how will I ever know, Louis?
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
How do I look?
The ship is sailing wihout us!
It is! Take the back stairwell -
What was that?
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
Louis, look at me.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
The swamp...
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
You both did it?
You... fed on me?
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
Why not?
You want me to be a doll forever?
Sit still. It's not finished -
Why does he call you that?
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
I want more.
