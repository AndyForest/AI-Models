Louis, put me in my coffin...
Laudanum!
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
We forgive each other then?
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
Stop pestering me then!
What plans?
Not you my dear.
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
Stop her Louis!
It will grow back again!
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
But you're the fairest by far.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
I didn't realise.
What night? What do you mean?
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
No... You come back to me Louis...
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
She's here, your wounded one.
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
That and more.
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
Unless I make her one of us...
You finish her - if you feel so much -
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
I know. Let her alone.
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
You fool, what have you done?
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
As did the one who made me.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
I don't know any hell -
The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
Read her thoughts.
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
I know. It gets cold so fast.
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
You have fed. You were made for this...
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
Take him.
Come, you're going to feed now.
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
You're sure?
Did I hear a yes?
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
You really want to be with them?
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
You've just done it -
Let's call that a start.
Call him.
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
You want death? Is it death you want?
They would have killed you -
