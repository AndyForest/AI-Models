What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
You were their leader. They trusted you.
And yet you knew what I would o.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
You let them do it.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Yes... My God...
And the vampires of the Theatre?
That's what the one who made me said.
We can do that?
You said there were none.
Then I leave too.
We want no quarrel with him.
Then blame the one who made her...
But why?
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
No, my beloved, my child.
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
Listen to me.
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
Then God does not exist...
Then there is nothing.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
Who made us what we are?
What are we?
So you have the answers...
Are you the leader of tis group?
We had feared we were the only ones...
Your lips, they didn't move.
Monstrous.
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
It's only mortal death.
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
Yes...
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
He can protect us, Claudia.
So you felt it too!
That's not so.
Never.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
Do you think I would let them harm you?
What danger?
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
This is monstrous!
This is no performance.
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
Come, Claudia...
You know her?
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
Yes.
Yes...
Still my beautiful child.
Not yet.
It can't be -
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
And you never cried -
I can't. Go away from me.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
Don't mock, Claudia...
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
He'll never let us go.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
We're immortal. You've always known that.
Claudia - don't -
Claudia! You did that?
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
He jests.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
What have you done?
You have it...
I tried...
Yes. I remember...
I have to go now Lestat...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
And they frighten you?
It's only a siren...
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
That's all past, Lestat.
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
CLAUDIA!!!
Are you mad????
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Lestat, what do you mean?
I didn't want to kill her.
Lestat!
What are you saying?
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
No...
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
NO!!!
Lestat - finish this -
Why do you do this Lestat?
The girl, Lestat -
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
I don't pretend to know.
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
We belong in hell.
Where are we?
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Paris? You came from Paris?
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
I can't.
But how do you know?
Have you ever been caught?
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
Fascination...
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Do you think so?
And if I don't?
It can't be...
Dear God, what have I done?
What have I done?
The crucifix -
I want a woman.
Dying?
Sure...
Yes...
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
But why do you want me?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
I can't do it.
How do you mean, start?
I want it!
Give it to me!!!
NO!!!!!
Diane!!!!
What do you want from me?
Why should I be?
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
Yes...
Then my luck would have changed.
Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
It's over, I'm telling you...
But it has. There is no more to tell.
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
How could I not? She had to know.
Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
Shall we go on?
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Can a vampire feel love?
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
I'm a vampire.
It's just a room...
You followed me here, didn't you?
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
And the child who did die?
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
And you know what you ask for?
You promise to care for her then?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
