And that makes you look like a squid?
What?
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
'Mornin', Jack.
Shit.
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
It's my nature.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Yeah. Good.
No, Starla! No!
What?
What are you doing?!
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
I'm sorry.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
No reception out here.
Starla, it ain't --
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
Hey, Grant.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
Pretty, ain't they?
What you up to?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Sorry.
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
Shelby!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Where are you?!
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Rorschach.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Do it.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Are you nodding?
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Shelby --
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
