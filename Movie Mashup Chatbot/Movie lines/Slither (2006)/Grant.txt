Brought you munchies.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Who's the lucky fella?
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Sure thing, killer.
Meat.
I loved you. I loved --
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
Who's that?
You're pretty.
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Welcome home.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Out.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Flip.
Sure you do.
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
