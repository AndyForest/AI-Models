And this is mine.
You took Bill.
Okay.
Aspirin.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
That wasn't a good night, no.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
How about Brenda?
No. Whatï¿½?
Grant, where'd you go?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Oh, yeah?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Just checking out the lights.
Whatcha' doin'?
That's not funny.
Grant, you're sick!
Grant, no!
I'll get if for you.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
It's just one of my students, Grant.
What are you doing?
Okay.
My present?
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
I never danced in a towel before.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Where are you going?
That's disrespectful.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
It's just a work thing.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Through a wound on his stomach?
What other stuff?
