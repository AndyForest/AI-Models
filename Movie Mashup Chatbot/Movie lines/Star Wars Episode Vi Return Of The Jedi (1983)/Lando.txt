We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
All right. Stand by.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
Good luck.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Lower it!
Han! Chewie?
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Here goes nothing.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
All wings report in.
