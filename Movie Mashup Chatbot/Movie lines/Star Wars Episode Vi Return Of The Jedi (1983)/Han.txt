Who are you?
Where am I?
I can't see.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Hey!
Yeah, sure.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
I thought she was with you.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
You got her warmed?
Luke.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Oh... great!
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
How are we doing?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Luke!
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
You love him, don't you?
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
Here's the terminal.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
I'm sorry.
Ahhh...
What's going on?
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
It'll work. It'll work.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Leia!
You, too.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
I'm trying!
Lando, grab it!
Lando!
Let's see.
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Come on! Come on!
What did he say?
Proper?!
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
What are you telling them?
All right, hang on.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
Good, I hate long waits.
