But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
But I have no sister.
Yoda spoke of another.
I can't kill my own father.
But I had to help my friends.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
I can't do it, Ben.
There's still good in him.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
We got separated.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Vader's on that ship.
All set.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
The same as always.
Wouldn't miss it.
Are you all right?
Han!
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Then you know why I have to face him.
Yes. It's you Leia.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
He's my father.
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Tell me.
What do you remember?
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Never-r-r!
I will not fight you.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
I will not fight you, father.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Come with me.
I know, father.
Well, I'm sorry.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Yes.
Yoda, I must know.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
