Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
