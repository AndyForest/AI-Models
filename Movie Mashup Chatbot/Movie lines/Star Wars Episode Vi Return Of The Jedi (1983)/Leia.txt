Yes.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Hold me.
I...
I don't know.
Shall we try and go around?
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Hey, are you awake?
That's all any of us can see.
I gotta get you out of here.
Someone who loves you.
Oh, no.
Quiet.
What's he saying?
Oh!
Ugh!
But, why must you confront him?
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Your father?
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Over there! Two more of them!
