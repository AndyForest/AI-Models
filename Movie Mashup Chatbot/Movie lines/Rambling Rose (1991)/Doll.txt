Why is it taking so long?
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
A baby... and she isn't even married.
What's goin' on?
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
What's happening?
You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
Then why does she act so dumb?
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
No, Mother, he's lying...
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
Buddy, that was my place.
He had his hand on her titty.
He kissed her.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Wow! Brrrother!
Boy! Wow!
Let me see!
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
I can't see, let me see...
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
I think she's gonna kiss him.
Okay.
Yeah.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
She's watching the car again?
I think Daddy suspects.
No.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
