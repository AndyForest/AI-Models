Agent Mapp! Thank you!
He knew her...!
"- every day."
But why? He didn't weight the others.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
What girl?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
He's here, Ardelia.
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
No. He won't come after me.
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
Boy, is that smart...
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Thanks, Ardelia.
What'd I do?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
I will... I promise.
Sometimes.
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Where?
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
You're all right! Where is he?
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
I understand.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
That wasn't me.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
Good idea.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
I think we may be, yes.
Thanks.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Sewing...
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Where?
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
You do until six p.m.
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
But if he knew we have so little time -
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Murdered...? How?
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
And what is that, sir?
Yes sir.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Who's the subject?
Not yet.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Dr. Lecter...
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Not lately. But maybe someday.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Sometimes you do.
I think so.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Did you ever work with her?
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
You know I can't make that promise.
Dr. Lecter -
Starling.
Yes. I'll tell you.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Yes...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Yes...! They were screaming.
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
I heard a strange sound...
Early. Still dark.
And - one morning I just - ran away...
Later, listen, I'll -
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
All right, then tell me how -
No. We just -
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
He kills w-
Then tell me how.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Yes, Doctor. Please.
How would he test?
On what basis would they reject him?
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No.
I - ran away...
Two months.
Horses - and sheep...
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
No. Tell me why.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
The death of my father.
Go, Doctor.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
A moth... How did you predict that?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
They all were.
Yes.
By the book, he's a sadist.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Who killed your patient?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
I don't know. Is it?
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
I never thought about it.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Why? Do you know something about him?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
Then please - do this test for me.
And the questionnaire...?
Reasonably so. Yes.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
No. You ate yours.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Five... so far.
No, I came because we need -
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
All that detail, just from memory...?
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Maybe they'll catch up.
Yes.
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
I am, yes.
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
