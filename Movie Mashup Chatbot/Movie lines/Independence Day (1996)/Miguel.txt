But I gave you some this morning.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
Stop it.
How' he doing?
There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
They let you out?
Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
