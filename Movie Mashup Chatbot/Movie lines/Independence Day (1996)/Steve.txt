I don't hear no fat lady.
We're loose!
Nice meeting you.
What're you doing?
I can't shake her free.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Just getting a feel for her.
Great.
Oh shit, we're late.
Butt-munch.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
You know me...
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Butt-munch.
Yes, I am.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
What?
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
He's doing a good job.
Jimmy, stay with me.
So push it!
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
Damn it!
I shouldn't have left her.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
How to kiss ass.
