Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
Better than we thought.
Yes, Sir.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
ETA with target; four minutes.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
She should be shortly.
But Mr. President...
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
With their shields down it might be possible.
How long would their shields be down?
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
It's doing what?
How do you know?
A meteor?
