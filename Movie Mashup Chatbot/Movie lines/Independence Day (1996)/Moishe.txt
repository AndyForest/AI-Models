All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
What'd I say?
David, you're drunk.
This I can see.
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
You punched the President in the face?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
You can do that?
It's perfect the line is busy?
You try Martin?
Spunky?
Not listed, huh?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
What the hell is that?
All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
So think already.
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
