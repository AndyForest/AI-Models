Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
This is ridiculous.
It had been deemed classified.
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
That's impossible...
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Mr. President?
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
What the hell's going on?
But, Mr. President...
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
