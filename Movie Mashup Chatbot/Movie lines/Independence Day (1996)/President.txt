Then get them out of there.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
Roger.
Where's it headed?
Grey, you read me?
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
Then find them.
But what, General?
And our troops here?
How're we doing?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
We're being exterminated.
And our forces?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
Where are they?
Any news on my wife?
Is my wife in the air?
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Then God help us.
I had a feeling you would.
I said call them back.
Call them back.
Deploy.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Above American soil?
We're leaving.
So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
I'm not leaving.
Can they be killed?
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Yes.
What do you want us to do?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
And before here?
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Why did you people come here?
