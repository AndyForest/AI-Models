Let me out! Let me out of here!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
You know you did!
What's that -- what's that?
That man there!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
