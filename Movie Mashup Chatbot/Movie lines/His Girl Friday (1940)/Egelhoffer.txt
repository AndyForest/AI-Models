Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
They're always after me for interviews.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
Point the gun at me!
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
