We know what you're up to.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
What a chase!
So long, Hildy.
I'll call.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Okay.  Forget it.
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
Did you get that, Hildy?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
You fight it cut.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
What's your hurry?
Say, Hildy...
Get the cops, somebody.
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Look out!
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
