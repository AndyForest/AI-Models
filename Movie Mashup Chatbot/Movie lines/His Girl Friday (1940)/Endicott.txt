Better let us in on it, Mollie.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
She looks as though she's going to come to.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Hey!
Open up there, will you!
Who locked the door?
Beats king up.
I call. What you got?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Well, that about covers everything.
Hold the phone!
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Call you back.
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Now, where is he?
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Goodbye, Yonson.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
