Get out of here, you!
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
No, you don't!
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
You'll ask me to what?
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
I don't know --
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Me, too.
You said it!
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
What?
Not this gun!
Where'd you get this?
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Hold her, boys!
Just a minute, Johnson!
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
After all I've done for you --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
What went off?
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
Just one second --
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
For who?
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
And so do I!
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
I was just going to!
That's a lie!!
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
Throw him out, Frank.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
What?
Just -- one -- second!
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
No -- don't out me off.
I did.  Hold the wire.
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
An attempt to ruin us!
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Fred!
What do you mean -- through?
If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Got you, Williams!
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
