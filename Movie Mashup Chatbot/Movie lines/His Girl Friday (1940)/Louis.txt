I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
Huh?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
First you got to sign a receipt.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
