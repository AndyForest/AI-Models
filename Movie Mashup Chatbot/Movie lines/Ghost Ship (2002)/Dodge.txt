You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
The turbine blew.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
Wrong. It's Friday.
What day is it?
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
Let's not be too hasty.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
What's so great about Sweden?
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Damn mind of it's own.
Fucker!
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Lemme see.
What? You sure?
How about now?
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
With that coxswain dickhead.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
Yeah, yeah.
What?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Right. Wednesday.
Then what the hell happened to him?
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
A what?
Smokes?
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
Gimme a break.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
What're you crazy?
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Ready?
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
You think that's funny
Yeah.
Roger.
Maureen?
What?
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
What is your first name?
Why not.
Where from?
Right.
Sorry.
There's a charming thought.
Right.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
What the fuck -- ?
What?!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Maybe you can tell me then.
I don't know what you're talking about?
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
On a passenger ship in 1953?
Not me.
I think you better see this for yourself.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Dodge to Murphy.
Right.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Why not? Why the fuck not?
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Sounds like the hull.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
Or somebody stopped them.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Went aboard.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
Three, four days.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Hard to say.
The right way and the wrong way.
Like I always say --
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Turbine rotor's shot.
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
Threw a turbine blade.
Mother fucker!
Sounds reasonable.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
If you get it back in one piece.
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
Smugglers maybe.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
