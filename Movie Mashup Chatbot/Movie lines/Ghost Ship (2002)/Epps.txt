Get up.
Dodge.  Dodge.
Why not?
Did you?
Try Wednesday.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Oh yeah.
Seen a lota movies.
Maybe he isn't alone.
So we kill him?
Maybe that is his boat.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
I like my job.
Guess I'll just keep working.
What other choices have we got?
This's gonna hurt a little.
Or uninvited guests.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Bring it on, dude.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
No.
Roger?
Maureen.
Maureen.
What?
One more?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Better than starving to death.
Sudden flashes of light.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Any dizziness?
Because of the gold.
You're a pal.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
That's a good thing?
That's what I call a payday.
Probably didn't have time.
You mean, before she sank.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Could be a fishing boat.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Morning everybody.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
So you killed them?
You killed them.
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
What?
What happened?
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
They went crazy.
Maybe it was more than that.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
What do we do with him?
Right here.
Nope.
Epps, over.
Just lucky I guess.
I don't know.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
What happened.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
The what?
What do you think happened on this boat?
Couldn't sleep.
Hey.
It's not gonna hold us.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
The same day she supposedly went down.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
But, who -- ?
What?
Only something must've gone wrong.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Same. Any luck?
He needs a doctor.
Greer?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
Epps.
Yup.
No cowboy shit. Right.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
There's somebody else on this boat.
The guy. He just came this way.
Did you see him?
Why not call for help?
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
You're more practical than superstitious.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
So what did happen?
Nope.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
She was sailing up north, right?
What'd you find up there?
Coffee?
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Go on.
It's my pen name.
