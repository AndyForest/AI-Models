I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
The case could be made.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
Crash victim?
