I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
What does he want from you?
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Can you drive?
Are you still involving me in your crash?
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
Are we allowed to park here?
