I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
Not yet. It's only beginning.
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
One of your suitors?
I thought that was you, up there.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
No. But when he's in that car...
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
It does.
You're not envious?
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
You should have gone to the funeral.
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
It's about time.
Have you seen it?
What!? They brought the car here?
Where's the car?
And her husband? What was he?
That's going well, then.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
Thank you.
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
Did you come?
Where were you?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Please finish your story.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Isn't that rather too close...?
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Are we imagining it?
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
So - why the airport?
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
You haven't told me where we're going.
Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again.
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Hard to say.
You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.
You're kidding.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
What is it?
I can drive.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
No.
Where are you?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
You could get your wish at any moment.
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
Yes.
