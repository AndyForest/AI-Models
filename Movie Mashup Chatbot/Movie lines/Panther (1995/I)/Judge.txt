Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Who's they?
Brimmer you're fucked up...
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Yeah, it's me.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
What are you crazy?
What's with you?
Yeah... whatever you say.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
I got you.
Yeah.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
Naw... I gotta...
Cy... I ain't even sure.
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
I don't know. Look around man.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Yeah.
Brimmer.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
What, I don't know how you mean?
I don't know about that.
They were empty...
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But...
I'm down.
No man. Gonna walk.
Yeah... let me think about it.
I don't know.
So what's the deal?
Yeah.
We'll all get out of here together.
Motherfuckers...
You alright?
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
Fuck is up?!
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Nothing.
If you got something to say, say it.
Huh?
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
Maybe...
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Just a kid.
And who is we?
Yeah, I do.
I saw... but...
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
Rose?
Why didn't you tell me?
Where is he?.
What?
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
My Mom's at that.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
I don't know. I really don't.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
Yeah.
Yeah... cop hit me...
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
