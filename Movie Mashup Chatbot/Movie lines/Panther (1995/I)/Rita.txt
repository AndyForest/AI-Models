I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
You don't look alright.
