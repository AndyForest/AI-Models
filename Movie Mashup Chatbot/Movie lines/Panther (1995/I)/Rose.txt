Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
Ain't no one seen him.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
This cool the heat off you any?
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
