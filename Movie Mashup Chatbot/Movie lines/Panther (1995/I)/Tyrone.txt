You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
Alma I told you to...
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
Oh shit Alma... you're...
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
Alone...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
C'mon let's...
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
We're like policing the police.
We need money first...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
That's right brother... listen and learn.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
Shut the fuck up!!
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
Bullshit...
What are you saying?
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge?
Sorry man...
You got something on your mind... "brother."
What's up with you?
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Just the legit shit.
Fuck maybe... be there.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Well, act like it. Come on.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
