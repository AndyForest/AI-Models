Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
What the fuck?
Like?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Judge, calm down.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Inspector Brimmer
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Get out of the fucking car.
Get out of the car.
Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
So... we understand each other Judge?
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
