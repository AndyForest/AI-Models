No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
I am telling the truth.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
Who?
Of course.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
No... it's life.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Not if I don't let her.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
Impossible.
Not quite.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
My two favorite girls.
Excuse me?  Start?
I do?
Do what?
Thank you.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
No.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
She said you were very beautiful.
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
She doesn't want pity.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
-- I can explain.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
-- You can't go in there!
Everyone you know is lying.
Soon.  Soon.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
You really think so?
Better late than never.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Simone does not control my destiny.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Even the fall from the plane.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
What about it?
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
I'll send you her resume.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
She'll drive herself.
If it's on the page...
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
"Forever".
Why not?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Almost right.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
You're not renewing my contract.
Spare me.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
Please.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
Please put your clothes on
You're with me to be close to her?
Simone?
What I do to Simone?
What?... What did you say?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
You look so, so...
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
I know what you mean.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
There's... a wall between you --
You can't.
Absolutely not!
Hal, what are you doing?
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
Body double.
You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
Clyde.
You never were together, Hal.
Hello, Hal.
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
I'm already dead.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
You saw that?
You do?
What's that?
I don't know anything about computers.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
I need flesh and --
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
I've seen them all before.
I'm sorry.
Good for you, Hank.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I was misquoted.
You want me to call Security?
-- Please, get away from me.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Lainey...
No, that was me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
She did... didn't she?
I love you, Lainey.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
Really?  Too bad.
You know me -- married to my work.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Night, Lainey.
Precisely.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
If anyone asks about Simone --
You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
How?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Can't you stop that?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
She can't watch herself.
You know, I... don't know.
Me too.
There was no other way.
Not quite how I imagined it --
She still with Kent?
Your mother couldn't make it?
Hello, Lainey.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Hello, sweetheart.
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
I could get the death penalty.
This should take care of Mother.
You love her, don't you, Max?
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
She looks a lot like you.
What now, Sayer?
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Abduction?
I'm keeping it in trust.
-- I bet you have.
The background is.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
It's a yacht.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
They are alive, Sayer.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Do I know you?
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
You could play the lead.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
Yes, I'd like that.
Thank you.  It's not important.
Yes.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
Taller?  What?
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Good.
Let's take it down a notch.
Simone, are you there?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
The only real truth is in the work.
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
A star is...
Good morning, Simone.
