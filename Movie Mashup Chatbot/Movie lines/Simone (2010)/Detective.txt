We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
