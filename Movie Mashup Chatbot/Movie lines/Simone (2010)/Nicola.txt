You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
But that's Simone's part.
Thank you.
Would you like me to read?
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Taller, Viktor.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
You're in breach.
