Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Hello, is this Elaine?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
No, I'm okay.
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
-- What you don't understand --
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Hi.
