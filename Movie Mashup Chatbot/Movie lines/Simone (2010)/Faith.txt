"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Is that a problem?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Yes, call me Simone.
Do what you do to Simone.
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
... so much like her?
Of course.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
