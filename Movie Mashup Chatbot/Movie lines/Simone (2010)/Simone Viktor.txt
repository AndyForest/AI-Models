Good-bye.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
I'm not --  He's not.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
You know what I'm talking about.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
You did create me.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
I am the death of real.
Maybe he can.
You mean they buy it?
... digitized.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
