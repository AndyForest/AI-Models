Simone!
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
Somebody said she was here.
Is she here?
How did the wall get there?
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
Why not?
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
For her?
How will you do our love scenes?
It was more in passing.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
