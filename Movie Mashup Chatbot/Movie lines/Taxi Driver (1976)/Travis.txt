Nah. I ain't interested.
Huh?
They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first.  You got anything to carry these in?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
Huh?
Is there a firing range around?
Nah, this'll be fine.
How much to get a permit to carry?
How much for everything.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
I got money.
You got a .44 Magnum?
Sure.
Yeah.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Well, I hope he wins.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Hello, Betsy.
Can I call you?
What about the record?
But... Betsy...
Huh?
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty...
Well... mostly...
This is sort of high class...
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
What do you mean?
Where are you going?
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
Damn.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
I bought a couple of tickets.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Oh. Who was that again?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
What?
It keeps ya busy.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
I know. I could have picked you up.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
I can believe that.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
My name is Travis.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Yes, mam.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Who mam?
That's fine.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
No, I'm serious, really...
What is your name? My name is Travis.
20 bucks?
Nah.  I suppose not.
I have.
Huh?
In the jungle. 122nd.
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
My work may take me out of New York.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
Cops don't do nothin.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
Do I look like a narc?
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I... I don't get along with people like that.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
He shoots dope too.
He looks like a killer.
Huh?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
Where?
Where is home?
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Can I see you again?
Well, I tried.
But that one night?
Don't you want to go?
Do you understand why I came here?
Don't you understand anything?
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Listen...
Do they drug you?
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
That's a nice name.
What's your real name?
What's your real name?
That ain't much of a name.
What's your name?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Why you hang around with them greasers?
Well... I guess so.
Hello.
No.
Have you tried the telephone?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Why should it be grounded?
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
Damn straight.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Yes, Sir.
No.
So I hear.
No, I want long shifts.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
Some. Here and there.
Twenty-six.
Also clean.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
I know. I tried that.
I can't sleep nights.
Yes.
No Sir.
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
You would, huh?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there.
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Show it to me.
Get it.
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
I'm here to see Iris.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Hey, Sport. How are things?
I'm hip.
I'm no cop.
Shit.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Your name Sport?
Thanks.
Neither do I, I guess.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Like do anything, you know.
Yeah.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Real down.
Well, I just, you know...
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Wiz?
Slow.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Hey Wizard.
