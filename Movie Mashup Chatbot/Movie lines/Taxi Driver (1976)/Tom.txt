Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
Just follow me.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
Show me how he did that again.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
With the other hand, right?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
You sure he's not Italian?
Is he Italian?
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Ouch!
This is gotta be a game, right?
How long has he been there?
What taxi driver?
No, why?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
With who?
Kidding around... you know, fun.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
More people watch it.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
You forgot "sexy".
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
