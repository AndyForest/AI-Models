Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Travis?
Thank you, Travis.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Hello, Travis.
Keep it.
I'm getting a taxi.
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
My God!
I mean porno movies.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
I'm leaving.
What's wrong?
But this is a porno movie.
What are you doing?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Kris Kristofferson.
The singer?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction".
You know what you remind me of?
You must be rich.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
What hours do you work?
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
The DMZ?
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
Huh?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
The moon?
That's really something.
What did you do?
Really?
What kind of people?
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Where do you live?
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Thank you, Travis.
Yes?
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
I don't know...
Why?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Well, we're all working tonight.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
You want to canvass?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
What is it? I'm busy.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
He's Black, OK?
No, why?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Oh, are you all right?
This I gotta see.
Try holding the match like this.
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Just what?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Oh, Tom, please.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
