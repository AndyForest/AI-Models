And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
For a fee.
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
Yeah.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
The kind with a brush.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
I know.
The taxi life, you mean.
It happens.
Things got ya down?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Yeah?
Yeah?
What's the action around?
So howsit?
Travis.
