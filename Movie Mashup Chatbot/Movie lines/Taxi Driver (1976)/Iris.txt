What do you mean?
You don't have to.
I sure hate to go alone...
Sure you don't want to come with me?
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
You're not much with girls, are you?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
How?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
What should I do? Call the cops?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Yeah.
You a narc?
What's so important?
Why?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Why not?
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Who's a killer?
God, you are square.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Pittsburgh.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Well, you want to or not?
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
That's not hard to do.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
I can leave anytime I want.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
You can do it in my mouth.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
Oh, come off it, man.
I musta been stoned.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
You want to make it like this?
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I don't remember.
No.
Why? Who are you?
That's what you think.
Iris.
I don't like my real name.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
Easy.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
A girl needs protection.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
You looking for some action?
