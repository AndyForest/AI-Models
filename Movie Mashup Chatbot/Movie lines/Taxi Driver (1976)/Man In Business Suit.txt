Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.

Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
