Not interested.
Yep! The Walls of Jericho.
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed�  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tired�and it's the only thing around.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Who�me?  Want to see me?
Come here, you little fool!

I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
