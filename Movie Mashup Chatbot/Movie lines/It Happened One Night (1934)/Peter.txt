Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself�long ago.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day�whether it's coming to her or not.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
Yeah�with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
We'll go into that some other time.
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
Who said anything about a reward!
What ten thousand?
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami�  for the love of it?
Yeah.
No�no. What the deuce do I want to�
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me�those things give me a stiff pain.
"I found a million dollar baby�"
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
What happened to your money?
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it.
No.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
All right, let it go.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Driver!
You win!
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Oh�the papers�
Huh?
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Same to you.
You bet I did.
You're forgetting you're married.
Better go back to your bed.
Maybe.  Sure�sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd�  Yeah, but where you going to find her�somebody that's real�somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Me?
Nope.
Yeah, swell.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
A black eye.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!
Come on! come on!
Come on�get in.
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Eat a carrot.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
What for?
What're you going to do?
You! Don't make me laugh.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke�and hungry�and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this�  �with a follow through.
Number two is a wider movement�a smile goes with that one�like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement�  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it�
You think it's simple, huh?
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you�carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me�goodnight!
Uh-huh. Want one?
Carrots.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
No. But I've got a penknife.
Hitch-hiking.
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Sure.
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
But what!
Thought you were hungry!
Here. Eat your head off.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
What's got into you?
What's the matter?
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
Well, take them off.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
What?
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
This looks like the best spot.
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance�a natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he�
Not a one.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation�a warm heart�and a loving nature.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
You're crazy.
This isn't "piggy-back."
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Okay. Hang on to these.
Aren't you afraid of me?
Yeah.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
It takes money to buy food.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
I don't trust that chatterbox.
What's the matter?
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman�a trip like this.
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough�we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you�
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
Detectives!
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Santa Claus?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Um. You're doing all right.
Yeah?
No. No. It's too good a story.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
I thought maybe�uh�"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Egg. One egg�doughnuts�black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer�we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
Hurry up and get dressed.
High time you got back.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Hey�you're little, aren't you?
Here�take mine.
Like what?
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
You'll find the showers�and things�right back of the second cottage.
Listen, Brat�I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Here�
The pleasure is all mine.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Not at all.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first�then the tie�then the shirt�now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I�
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Oh, this?�I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments.
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.
Yeah. Come on�we're stopping here for the night.
Hey, Brat�!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Shut up!
You're on a budget from now on.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Beat it!
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
I never thought of that.
What for?
That's right. You didn't.
Take my advice�grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.
I found it on the seat.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Yes.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that�
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Well�of all the�well�  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Are you talking to me?
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you�  scram.
Just your imagination.
Eight o'clock.
Hey�you not up yet? Come on�come on!
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
I've been thinking about you.
What's that?
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah? Where?
What's up?
Thanks, Joe.
Yeah, where am I?
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Listen, Pal�you've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone.  A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
For heaven's sake, Joe�stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Yeah.
I am, Joe.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Never mind . . . Listen�suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars�and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
That's it.  I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
Okay, Joe. Listen�you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn�anytime I ran into a story that looked good�I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
Joe, listen�
Wait a minute, Gordon�I�
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that�
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Well, you got one now. �Come on, fill 'er up.
What?
Listen, man�I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Collect.
Send it collect.
Mush. Mush.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
You send telegrams here?
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
If you don't�Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
You love them, don't you?
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Where do you live?
Yeah ?�How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Sh-sh-sh�! Soft pedal, you mug!�before I� What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing�and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Yeah�the "big boy"�the Boss of the outfit.
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
What's on your mind?
Why?
What?
Yeah�wouldn't it?
That's right.
Thanks.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.
Yeah. Come on�come on!
I'd like to sit with my�uh�wife�if you don't mind.
There's a seat over there for you.
Hey, you!
