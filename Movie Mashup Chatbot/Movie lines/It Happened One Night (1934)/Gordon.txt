Don't accept any more.
Collect?
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office�unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours.
Huh?
When you sober up�come in and see me.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn�then something comes along�messes up the finish�and there you are.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Okay, pete.
Well, I'll be�
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
You!
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
I'd put you there myself.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Who's she gonna marry?
If it's on the level.
You're drunk.
Huh?
What!
What's the thousand bucks for?
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Don't "Joe" me.
Get out!
Get out of here!
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
