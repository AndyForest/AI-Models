Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
Sorry�I didn't mean to�
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff�much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Sure. Anything you say.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
No.
Sure�sure�I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Oh, gee, Mister�you wouldn't�you ain't thinkin' about�
Yeah. Just babies.
Orange, New Jersey.
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with�
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see�and�
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Why�no�
Huh?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to�
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Five G's�or I crab the works.
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
Say, Buddy�
What's up?
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'�you know�to make things pleasant.
Wife?
What's the idea?
Huh?
Well, you're two up on me now.
