Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
Are you going to see him?
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Oh, please, Dad�
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why? Do you know him?
Yes. Peter Warne.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you�made your life so miserable�and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
No, I'll go through with it.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
I don't know.
He's marvelous!
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
No.
On the road.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
Oh, no.
Nothing.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Stunt?
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
Oh, hello, Dad.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men�particularly if you're a shining example.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
You talk as if he were a gigolo�or something.
You only met him once .
What've you got against King Westley?
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
South America!
Where are you taking me?
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because�
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
Why don't you put me in chains?
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Congratulations.
I hope you got your money.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter�
I love you.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Why not?
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
That's swell!
What about money?
Any luck?
Darling!
What'd you give him for the car?
What happened?
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on�
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Never!  I'm going in and ask him�
Why not? I'm hungry.
We don't need forty cars.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
You might give me a little credit.
Mind your own business.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car�and I won't use my thumb.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Here comes a car!
Amazing.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Clever.
Oh, no!
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You're an expert, I suppose.
What if nobody stops for us?
I hate the horrid stuff.
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
Raw?
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Hay�in my teeth.
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking�
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Really?
What are you thinking about?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
Try me.
What?
was so scared�that it scared�
was�but�
I don't want it now.
know�but�
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Oh, Peter�
What!
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
Peter�
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
You're prejudiced.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
That's silly.
My uncle�Mother's brother�had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
Yes.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride�
Of course it is.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
No.
I'm following you.
To New York?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Why, haven't you�?
What do you mean�starvation?
Not as long as I'm alive.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
Yes.
I better go over and see her.
I refuse to resign!
You always want to run everything.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
How about Cinderella�or a real hot love story?
Next week "East Lynne."
You weren't so bad yourself.
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Well, you were!
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
What are you talking about?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Thanks, professor.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
King�King Westley was in it.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I�I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Must be the Spring.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Nope. No complaints.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
I'll find it myself.
Where is the shower?
Where'd you say the showers�and things�were?
Like this. I have no robe.
I can't go out like this.
Outside!
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You�you had it pressed.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Who are you?
Do you mind putting out the light?
Smart aleck!
You're not really serious about this, are you?
That, I suppose, makes everything�uh�quite all right.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but� you've been very kind.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Your ego is colossal.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do�leap for joy?
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Are you talking to me!
Now, just a minute�you can't�
That's none of your business.
You have your nerve!  Here, boy�!
Of course I do. What do you mean�
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
Here, boy!
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
I didn't ask for your advice.
You must have me confused with�
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
What are you talking about?
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
My ticket?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is�  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
I don't want it reported!
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Why, no�I�  Yes . . . I guess I will.
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
What am I going to do now?
What happened?
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Tell that man not to drive so fast.
Driver!
I beg your pardon!
Won't I ever see you again?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
You sound like a hobo.
Do you know?
Well, I am.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and�and scared.
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
I'm out! I'm out!
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited�
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it�the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus�I told them to wait!
Where's the bus to New York?
Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
But can't you wait until morning�
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the�
Why, he'll be back.
Isn't he here?
Husband?
Get out!
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
