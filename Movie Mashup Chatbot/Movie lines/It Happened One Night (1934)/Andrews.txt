I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
How is she?
Oh�Mary�
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Do you love her?
That's an evasion.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
You were taken for a buggy ride?
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to�
You're a peculiar chap.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for�
The reward.
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
Yes, I know�but�
And this is what you want�thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in�
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
Come in. Sit down.
Mr. Warne?
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if�
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
I suppose so.
I'm sorry you read it.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Oh, no�no.
Peter Warne!
Is that his name?
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why�
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Fine man to fall in love with.
Well!
Ridiculous!
Oh, come now�
Well, if it's as serious as all that�we'll move heaven and earth to�
Who is he?
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare�I�when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm�I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions�I�  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
I knocked several times.
Ellie�
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Please don't shout.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Never mind�I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it�if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm�mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
I'll get it annulled.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
South America.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
Because marrying that fool King Westley is�
You ought to know why. Because�
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
I might.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
What's this about not eating?
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to�  �as long as I can get her back.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement�that you've had a talk with me�that we've reached an understanding�that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads�all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
I haven't the slightest idea.
We've done that already.
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me�and maybe we'll be friends�  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Sock her!
No?  Say, listen�I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers�some of the most powerful people in the world�but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen�if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Don't want to talk to�don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
Amateurs!
What do they say?
Any others?
