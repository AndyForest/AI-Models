What happened?
Yes, of course.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that�
Yes, sir.
What would you like to have me do?
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
You talk as if�
Why; naturally, I�
You've made that quite evident�with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
Whatever you say, darling.
You bet we did.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
