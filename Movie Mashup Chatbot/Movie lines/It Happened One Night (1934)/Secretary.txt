There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
They're practically all the same, sir.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Yes.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Mr. Gordonï¿½
