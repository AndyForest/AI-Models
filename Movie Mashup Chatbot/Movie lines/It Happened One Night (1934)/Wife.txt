You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Yes�if he is your husband.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady�
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
A trumpet?
What do you reckon that's for?
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Funny couple, ain't they?
Zeke.  Git!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Then�you'll have to git !
Oh!!
See that. They're gone!
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
I don't trust him.
Mebbe.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
There you go�trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you�
