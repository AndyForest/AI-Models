Nice guys finish last. I should know.
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Ronnie!
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
Sorry Veronica.
