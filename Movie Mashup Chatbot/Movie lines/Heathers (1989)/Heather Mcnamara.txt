So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
King David.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
Color me nauseous.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
Probably....
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Suicide is a private thing.
Shit.
Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
No way, no day!
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
