We're lucky to be alive.
Stop it.
Anyone.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
My truck.
Come on!
We're better off.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Oh yeah?
You weren't helpin'.
Fuck no.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Your parents of relation?
Your brother, huh?
Why do you take shit from him?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
We gotta be close.
We gotta try.
I'm in.
