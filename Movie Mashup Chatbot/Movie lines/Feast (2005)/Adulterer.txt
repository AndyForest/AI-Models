They'll get in! We'll all die!
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
Stop!
Spare me.
I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
Where are you two going?
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
We should go! We should go right now!
I will not die because of him!
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
Right.
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
