I don't think you should...
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
Well, it don't look pretty.
Her fella.
Nah, I got the gun.
Yeah.
We shot a skunk.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Who the hell would you call?
Gonna stay for a couple?
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
You got something better?
Wha?
Oh!
Come on, come on.
Upstairs.
I think I know where a CB is.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
You seem mighty collected about this.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Shit!
In the corner, behind the curtain.
You all sure about this?
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
There's a tunnel.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
They're right here.
Well, justice is funny.
So, your husband ditched you?
And the head?
And the rest of 'em?
Just an observation.
What?
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
No. You?
Get in line!
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
