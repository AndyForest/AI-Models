Where is everyone?
We're going to get my little girl.
We'll meet in three hours?
You know where it is?
They'll be back.
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Careful.
We can't risk letting them in.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Just move!
We just smeared a skunk.
Where's the tunnel?
Follow me.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
What's it for?
What tunnel? Where?
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
Easy.
Hey!
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
And that's how I ended up here.
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
But not flush against the tunnel?
What's in the back?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
What?
Anybody else?
We're going to get help.
Anyone else?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
Keys.
Nine?
Max?
How many?
Open?
Four door?
Is it gassed up?
What's it for!?
What's going on between you two?
What do you mean what?
What?
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Good.
Will these boards hold?
He shot you the other time.
He only shot you once.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
He's dead.
My husband...
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Get something on that.
COME ON!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Hurry!
If he doesn't shut up...
Shit!
Move it!
Move slow and move quiet.
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Fine, Chief.
'Eh, Chief?
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Let's move.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
YOU'LL HIT US!
Let's go.
Nothing, just lookin'.
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Get to your cars!
Go!!!
Go! Go!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Wait God-dammit!
Hold it!
That's fine.
Okay, well that's something.
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
I think --
We should stick together out there.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Her name is Charlie.
Right.
I admire your strength.
You know you don't have to do this.
All right.
Let's lock off this room.
Stop her!
That's one piece of four problems.
