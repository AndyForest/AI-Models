You gotta be with me on this.
We'll be food, dickheads!
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
OPEN THE DOOR!
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Where's that?
C'mon guys--
What now, Geronimo?
He's dead.
Who's with me?
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Go douche.
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
Why don't you go check it out?
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
Oh? And what's that?
Whoa!
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Blow the goddamn hatch!
What the hell's going on here!?
No bullshit.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
You smell like ass!
Welcome back.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Yeah, maybe.
HELLLLLLLLP!!
SHIT.
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
I'm fine! I'm fine!
You keep that key handy.
No shit.
What?!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
What?
Gimme the keys.
Duh hickey.
Got 'cha!
OH JESUS!
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Amazing you made it this far.
BONSAI!
I'm sure.
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
