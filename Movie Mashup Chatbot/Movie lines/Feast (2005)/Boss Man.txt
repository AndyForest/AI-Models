With what just happened upstairs --
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
But it's got teeth.
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
IS IT CLEAR?!
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
How much I got, what?
Sure.
The girl's got rhythm.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Well...
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Seven.
Seven.
Holds four.
Covered.
Two.
Fully.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Nothing.
Huh?
What?
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Huh?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
What?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
