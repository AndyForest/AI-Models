Understood. Kirk out.
Have the Klingons responded?
Oh, please.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
You caught me on my way to the shower.
Bob?
Can we have it quiet?
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
If we could send a distress signal...
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Go, Sulu.
Transporter room. Status.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Put it on the screen.
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
Spock?
What is this?
Spock... don't.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
Spock.
Fire the rockets!
Spock... the booster rockets.
It must be all those marsh melons.
Hmmm?
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
That's a little vague, Spock -
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
Is what possible?
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
How do you know?
There's got to be a way out of this place.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I gotta sit down.
There, you see? See?
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
I ordered you to defend this ship.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Let me do something.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
Be one with the horse.
Spock.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Damn.  Let's go.
Fascinating.
Why?
What do you mean?
Who is it he reminds you of?
But he does seem familiar?
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
Not General Korrd.
I could use a shower.
Goodnight, Spock.
Goodnight, Bones.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes, Spock?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
What are you doing?
I've always known... I'll die alone.
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
Oh, God
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
MM.?
Because it's there.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
No special conditions?
About the ship...
You are mad!
Your vision?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
No. I refuse.
No... I didn't.
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
I'm afraid of nothing.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
I'll take you to the bridge.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
