It runs deep. Share it with me.
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
The ship....
No, no, it's not possible.
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
He has his doubts...
It will be your chariot!
It could. Yes.
With a starship!
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
Qual se tu?
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
What's going on?
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
A Federation starship.
Spock...
What have I done?
Because you, too, must know.
No conditions.
The ship needs its Captain.
Am I? We'll see.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Now learn something about yourself.
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
I don't control minds. I free them.
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
I trust your message was received?
We must change our course at once.
What are you doing?
No! No reply. Remain on course.
But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
Who are you?
I must have your starship.
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
I don't understand...
Why not?
Spock?
I know you better than that.
Each man's pain is unique.
You know I'm right.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
No. You must kill me.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
