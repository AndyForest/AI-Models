Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Join my quest.
The power was within you.
Let us explore it together.
Your pain runs deep.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
