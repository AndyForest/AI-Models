No, but you can bet they will.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
