No.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
We'll go in through that large breach.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
Wilhite, anything?
Cab One, radiation readings?
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
