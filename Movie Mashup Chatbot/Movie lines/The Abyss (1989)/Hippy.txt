Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Got it. Over.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Do we just leave him there?
That's Perry.
Everything is.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Virgil?
SHIT!
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
Turn it up, bozo.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Uh, oh...
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Hey!
How deep?
