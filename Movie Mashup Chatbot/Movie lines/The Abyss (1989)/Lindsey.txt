Hello, Brigman.
No, Bud, no... not you.
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Tell me later.
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
We've only got one suit.
How?
Calm down, Bud.
I don't know, look around.
You see where it's coming in?
They'll come out after us.
Well, that's that.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
You noticed.
Yeah.  So sue me.
Not in this thing.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
You owe me one, Virgil.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
Now what?
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
It's trying to communicate.
He's got the shakes?
You dumb jarhead motherf--
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
Bud, something really important is happening here.
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
Cute, Virgil.
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
But what did he see that made him panic?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
No.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
I haven't worn mine in months.
What are you still wearing that for?
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
That must be it.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Not for long.
Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
I can't believe you let them do this!
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
You better not say you missed that.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
How many are there?
Copy that.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Would we see the flash?
What kind of light?
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
