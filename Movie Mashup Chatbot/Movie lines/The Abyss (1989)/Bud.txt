You done impressing yourself, ace?
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
Where're you?
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
Nice shot, Lins.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
How you guys doing?
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
I'm taking you back out.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Hey, you okay?
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Okay so far.
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Who then?
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Hi, lady.
Oh God, Lins... I--
It is insane.
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
What's the plan?
FUCK LOGIC!!
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Alright, put this on.
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
I don't know how!
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
Son of a bitch!
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
Try again.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
You totaled it, huh?
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
He's jammed the mechanism.
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
I think it likes you.
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
No.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
Jesus, Lindsey--
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
What about O-2?
Need some help?
What's the scoop, ace?
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
What do you think he saw?
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
Fine.  Be that way.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
What happened?
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
I think you were worried about me.
You wanna know what I think?
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
Who else?
You never did like being called that, did you?
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
I'm switching off now.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Your rig?
Wasn't up to me.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Did you find Wilhite?
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Let's go, guys.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
All right.  Do it!
Is that it?  Is this right?
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Why bring it here?
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
What's the matter with you?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
God, I hate that bitch.
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
'Fish'?
He's convulsing!
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
