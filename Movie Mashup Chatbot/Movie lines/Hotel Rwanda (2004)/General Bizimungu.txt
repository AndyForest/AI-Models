You will tell them the truth.
I led no massacres.
I committed no war crimes.
You lie.
I am on a list! What list?
How so.
We are better here.
You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
You know what the Scottish call it?
Today.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
Get in.
I'll be over.
Whiskey?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
Where are my supplies?
You said you had no whiskey.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
I will see what I can do.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
He did.
The police are very busy.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders �we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.� What do you think would have happened? No different.
The high command? Our high command?
And what will they do with these satellites?
Satellites?
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
What did they say?
What did you overhear?
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
