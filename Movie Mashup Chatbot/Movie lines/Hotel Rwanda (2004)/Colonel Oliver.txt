We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Yes we have.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
I can't, I don't have the men.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
They're only taking the whites.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Anything. Strong.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
Paul, you know who this is?
