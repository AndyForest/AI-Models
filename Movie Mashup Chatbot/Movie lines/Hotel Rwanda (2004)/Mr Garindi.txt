Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
I will see what I can do.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
