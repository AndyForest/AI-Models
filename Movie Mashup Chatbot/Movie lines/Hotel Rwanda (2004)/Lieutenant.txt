I will remember that name.  Let's go.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Who did you call?
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
You are the manager?
