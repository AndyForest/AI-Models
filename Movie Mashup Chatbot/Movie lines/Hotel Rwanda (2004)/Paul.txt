We, who is we?
What happened?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
I'll be back.
Of course.
Leave it to me.
Excuse me?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
Ten.
Six.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
I don't have that much.
Name a price.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Please, I don't use guns.
Let me explain.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Of course.
I used to work at the Diplomat.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
What is this about?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
What is it?
Will you protect us.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
They fired a rocket at us.
Their people?
I don't understand.
Excuse me, Colonel.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
Canadian Club?
Where is she?
What's happening?
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
You think they will believe you?
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
You are a marked man.
Listen, you need me.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
No, sir.
No.
When?
What do you mean, General?
Where are they going?
Your police are at the gate?
We must go to the Diplomat.
Bring back your policemen...
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
The front gate would be best, General.
�Well rewarded� Those were his words.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
Satellites.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
The United Nations are still here.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
Let's go.
) You cannot kill them all.
What do you mean George?
You have no whiskey?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
At least.
Very good.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Thank God.
When will they be here?
Of course.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Just drive, Gregoire.
For supplies, you drive.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
Give me the phone.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
I would never do that.
This goes out live?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Promoted. House Manager.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
Call, sir?
That will take time.
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
Why sir?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
How much?
You have our cards.
Our cards, please.
Excuse me.
He will be here.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
I will give you my house.
How do you know?
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Was there blood?
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
I need a great favor.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
Of course.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
I have to go to the Diplomat.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
We have to have a plan.
We are almost out of everything.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
I have to stay.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
A Volkswagen.
What does it matter.
A car.
It was substantial.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
I have a confession. When we met...
A kiss.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I have to go out to get food.
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
Go to the roof now.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
We have been abandoned.
They are being evacuated.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
Give him time.
How can we help him.
Has Roger spoken yet?
I'll try.
Any luck?
This won't do.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
What!
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
Get in.
Stay with the children.
Where are you hurt, son?
Dawn. Then they go.
They know you are Tutsi!
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
I sent them home. Go and call them.
Murdered! By whom?
Jean Baptiste!
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
I couldn't help.
No.
Please, be quiet.
What?
Homework?
Let's have dinner first.
Thomas wants advice?
Your brother's here?
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Why?
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
There is one thing I need right away.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
What is this about no water?
When?
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
How much beer?
Where has all our beer gone?
What are you doing?
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
What! Paul storms off.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
How dead?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Many times.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
What's wrong?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
The staff, the guests.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
Where?
Who is this Simon?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Why the hurry, Roger?
Thank you, Roger.
Go downstairs, I will help you.
What is his room number?
Can I help you?
