You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Give me it.
And four children?
How many in your family?
Ten thousand francs for each one.
How much?
You want to pay me?
There is nothing to it.
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Where is your family?
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
Let me see your identity card.
We are looking for you.
Who are you?
