I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
Can I have your name again?
