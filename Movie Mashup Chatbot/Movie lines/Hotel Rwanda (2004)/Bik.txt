Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Cockroaches?
Paul!
