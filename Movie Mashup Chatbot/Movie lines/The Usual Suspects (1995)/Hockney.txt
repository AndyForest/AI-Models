It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
They fucking know everything.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
You are a criminal.
Can we stealth these guys?
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
What do you care what he says?
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
If I'm going in, I want a stake.
Me too.
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
