Edie, please.
That's enough, Edie.
Alright.
They ruined me tonight.
They'll never stop.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
Goddamnit.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
Just forget about it.
I'm having a stroke.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
This is not right.
I don't want to know.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
Dig.
Why don't you just calm down'
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
He's alright.
You heard right.
Just do what I tell you.
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
What is this?
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
We'll make it.
We'll make it.
No killing?
Three million?
Fenster and Hockney?
How are they going to do it?
Well, I'm sorry.
You okay?
You watch your mouth.
Tough break.
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
Never heard of him.
What fence? Who?
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
Get out.
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
What the hell do you want?
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
with what?
Let's say for example -
What time is it?
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
You're lying.
What did you say?
We'll see.
Neither do we.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
The answer is no.
What about Redfoot?
You set up the line-up.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Who's your boss?
Tell him we'll meet.
We want to meet him.
Who is he?
You didn't know.
A little of both.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
I shivved him.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
We're on vacation.
