He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
Business or personal?
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
