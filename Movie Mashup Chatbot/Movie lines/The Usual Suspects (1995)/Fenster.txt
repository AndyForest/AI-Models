Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?

Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
Then who goes?
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
