Umm ...
A glass of water would be nice.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
Did you hear what he just said?
What are we gonna do?
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
What if I
Keaton, I can't just -
Hungarian?
What-are they speaking?
Who's Keyser Soze?
What is it Keaton?
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Not if we do it my way.
Maybe more.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
I'11 be alright.
I was out of line.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
You have to come.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Don't hurt me.
If you'll just let me -
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
How do you do?
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
County. I was in for fraud.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
You think he's..?
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
I knew him. He would never -
This is all bullshit.
Edie...
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO.
No...
Because he was my friend.
Edie.
He wanted me to live.
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
I don't
I said I never heard of him.
I never heard of him.
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't.
Wait a minute.
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Give a guy a break, huh?
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
Right.
Kobayashi.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
I don't know about that.
You got him wrong.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
That was all Fenster and McManus.
He loved her.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
I'm not a rat.
No.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
He didn't have my lawyer.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
I know he was good.
I told the D.A. everything I know.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
