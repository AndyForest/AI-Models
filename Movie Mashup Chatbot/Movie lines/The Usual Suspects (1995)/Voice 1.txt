Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Immunity.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
