Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
Mr. Soze will be most -
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
I work for Keyser Sate.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
