Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Where's Luc and Pierre?
That is when we will go in.
Allez, allez!
Major, what do you think could have done this?
That is our job.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
They are with me!
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
It's Raymond.
Who the hell are you?
What'd they say?
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
I think we should leave now.
You were right.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Makes us look more American.
So you're in?
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
We, have already taken care of them.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
I need you to trust me.
We know.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
It's the French Secret Service.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
We've met before.
Are you looking for this?
