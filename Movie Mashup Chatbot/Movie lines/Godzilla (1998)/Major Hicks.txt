Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
Have them sealed off.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Get your people out of there or I will.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
You're fast.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
You gave them the tape?
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
What are you suggesting?
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
That's right.
You're standing on it.
Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
We know.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Follow me.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
