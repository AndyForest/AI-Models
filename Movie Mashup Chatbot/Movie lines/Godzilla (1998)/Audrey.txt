No.
But we can get to the west side faster.
The JFK? In the rain!?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
He's not going to do it.
Think we can fit up in there?
Don't you think we have enough?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Animal, I can't.
My God. He's going after the nest.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
He stole my report! That's my report!
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Nearly four years...
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Oh my God! They're coming!
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
You never said it was off the record.
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Nesting?
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Are you sure?
What else do you know about it?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
And you think this creature is one of them?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
Sure. I'd like that.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
Yeah, well...
What?
It's good to see you, Nick.
You must have quite some harem.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
Wish me luck!
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
That's the problem. He did.
Nick Tatopoulos.
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
My life sucks.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
You're kidding, right?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Can I use some?
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
We? I don't think so.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
I can't.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Mr. Caiman...
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Did you talk with Humphries?
