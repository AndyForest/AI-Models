Where's Audrey?
Who the hell are all these people?
Great. See ya then.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Big bites.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
Oh yes he will.
Only one way to find out.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.

Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
You made a mistake.
You okay?
We know, Audrey.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
That why you dumped him?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
