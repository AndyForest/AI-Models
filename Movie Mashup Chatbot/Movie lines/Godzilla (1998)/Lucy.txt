Go in there. Talk to her.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
Your old sweetheart?
What the hell are you doing?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Who is he?
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
Speak of the devil.
