Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
I guess so.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
What do you mean, Julie?
Julie? What's wrong?
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
You sure it's okay with you?
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
This was not my idea.
Are you sure?
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
To get out of Southport?
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
I'm sorry.
The shower again?
You don't seem fine.
You sure?
Julie! Wait! You okay?
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?
Ahh, that feels great.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
I'll go find him.
Where'd Estes go?
We'll only be a second, okay?
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
And do what with it?
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
You don't have to be a jerk.
How's the water?
So why are you still here?
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
