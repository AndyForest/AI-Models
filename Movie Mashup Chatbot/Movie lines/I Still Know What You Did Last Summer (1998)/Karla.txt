What the hell would you call this?
What about a radio?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Is that bad?
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Is he?
Oh, god, it's you --
...Nancy?
I'm holding your hand!
Julie?
I don't know...
What do we do?
It's too late for that.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
Be careful, Julie.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
What do you mean?
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
Julie...
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Just kidding.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
You get any sleep at all?
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay, I won't.
Karaoke -- perfect.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
I also promised Tyrell.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Hello? Hello?
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
No means yes.
Say yes.
Yet. Nothing yet.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
I thought you were out of town!
I thought you were out of town!
You think that's a good place to hide?
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Hey --
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Rio, baby!
Oooh, the mainland --
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Why? He can't help us.
How's Julie?
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
To a great weekend --
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
No. Yes?
Rio de Janeiro!
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Yes!
Well, I'm in school and --
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
