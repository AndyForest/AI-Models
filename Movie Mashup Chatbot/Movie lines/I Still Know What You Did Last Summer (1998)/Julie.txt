Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
I want off this island.
Listen to me. He's here.
Storm season?
We haven't exchanged anything.
Your what?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
You're okay. Thank god.
No, you're not.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
Come on, you can make it.
There's no way to lock it.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Then, we fight --
I've got to see.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
Let him go. I believe him.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
They never found the body.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
Karla!
Cancer in a box.
Nice move.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Some.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Not me...no way...
No.
No way.
Don't even think about it.
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
Karla! You promised.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
I'm the King of the World.
Oh!
Then, don't.
He does work hard.
But, he said he'd try.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Okay, okay. You're right.
The number's unlisted...
That could break the machine.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
No.
There's nothing between Will and me.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
What are you doing in my closet?
What are you doing in my closet?
You know me to well.
I love it here.
Never do that again.
Ray...what are you doing?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Will you try...for me, please?
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
It's okay.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
Ray, I can't...
Why are you being like this?
Ray, we're just friend.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I don't know.
Voodoo.
Ben Willis.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
...Why?
I trusted you.
Why are you doing this to me?
He's in it with Willis?
Did you get help?
I wasn't dreaming.
There was a body! I swear it!
It's in my room!
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
It's...him.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
It beets being on the mainland.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Deep breaths --
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
What?
I'm okay.
Right. Now I remember.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
It was one year ago...
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
