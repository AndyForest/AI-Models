I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
You're in 201 and 202.
What can I do for you?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Who? Who is here?
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
