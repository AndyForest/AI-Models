Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
I am well, Admiral.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
