Not me, Bones... They did it.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Come on, Pavel...
An experimental device, doctor.
What did you say she was getting?
What do you think, Spock?
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
-- That's the general idea.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
We've done it before.
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
Bones, stay here.
Bones --
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
It'll come back to him.
What do you mean?
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Understood. What is your plan?
Ah, well done, team 2.
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
No choice now, Scotty!
May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
... You have a point...
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
You tricked me.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
A spaceship with a missing man.
... Damn!
... Gone?!
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
Steady, now. We need your help.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Right.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Noon tomorrow...?!
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
You want the details?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
All right. The truth?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Who do you think I am?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
What's what?
What do you mean now?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Hm?
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
How will that be done, exactly?
You're upset about losing the whales.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Implicitly.
It's his way.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
What's going to happen when you release the whales?
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Iowa.
Memory problems, too.
Thanks.
We don't want to be any trouble.
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Back to San Francisco.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
How soon?
Why's that?
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
You mean man...
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Spock: Condition report!
Then... Where the hell are we?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Right.  Will you help us?
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Thank you, Spock.
Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Status?
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
... I see.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Spock...
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Yes.
... Simple logic.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
But you said toxic.
Explain.
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Well done, Mr. Spock.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
You've programmed that from memory...?
What are the variables...?
Surely you can be more specific...
What is our target in time?
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
Whales?
Spock...?
Where are you going?!
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Permission granted.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Picture, Uhura!
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Picture, please.
What is our condition?
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Steady as she goes...
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Weapons systems?
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Estimate range, ship to whales!
On screen.
Put them on screen!
Bearing!
Uhura!... Where!
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
Any luck...?
Everyone remember where we parked.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
On speakers.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
On screen!
What is it?
Mr. Sulu?
Systems report.  Communications?
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
The explosive override -- ?
The whales...?!
On my way...!
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
How long, Scotty?
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Mr. Sulu?
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
You will be in good hands here.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
