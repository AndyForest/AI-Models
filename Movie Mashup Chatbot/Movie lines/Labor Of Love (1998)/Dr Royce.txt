I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
I've seen it before.
I know what you're getting at.
Yes -- you are.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
So what's the deal Maurice?
