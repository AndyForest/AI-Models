Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
You need a ride, Preacher?
Are you a preacher?
Mine.
