Yes.  That's who I want to be.
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
What is that?
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
It's a company... MPG Capital.
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
-- we'll tell them what happened --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- we'll explain it --
But the police --
Oh, Jesus...
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I trusted you.
You knew he was coming.
He came to kill us.
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
He's dead isn't he?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
...omigod, no...
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Anytime.
Okay, so...
Jason...
I should go.
So this is it, right?
Where?
Looks familiar?
That's it?  Is that it?
You ever think maybe you have a family?
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
We're about an hour away.
I needed a break.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
Okay, so you're a victim.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
What are you talking about?
-- you could put it together --
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?

Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
What?  Like amnesia?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
What does that mean?
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
What if I say no?
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is --
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy --
You have blood on your pants.
For twenty thousand dollars.
So what's in Paris?
Jesus...
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Get the fuck away from my car.
It's a little late for that.
Oh, Jesus...

-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! --
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
