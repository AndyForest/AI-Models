I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
I'm going to Paris.
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
What do you want to do?
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
I thought you were never going to do that.
You're asking me a direct question?
I don't know what we're talking about.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
We have to go home, Jason.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
So it's time to go home.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
Enhance it.
What's that?
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
That'll solve all our problems.
What?
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
What the fuck is he doing?
What?
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- and they're sure it's him? --
Tell him we're busy.
What?
