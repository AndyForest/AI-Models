I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
His brother.  You know his brother?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
You are a friend of his?
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
