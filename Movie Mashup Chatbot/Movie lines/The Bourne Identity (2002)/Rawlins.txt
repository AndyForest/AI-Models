Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
Was it the break-in?
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
We thought you were gone for good.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
