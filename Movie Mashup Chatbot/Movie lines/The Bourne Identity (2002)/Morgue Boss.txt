-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
So get the hell out of here.
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
