Why?
What do they want me to do?
I think so.
What is Treadstone?
Treadstone.
Yes.
Paris.  I live in Paris...
Treadstone?
What do you mean?
I won't ask again.
That'll be their second worst mistake.
Keep it.
Jason Bourne is dead.
I don't think so.
That's all I get?
So now you know.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
I don't know.
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Are you Treadstone?
I don't know.
Who do you think sent me?
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
MPG Capital.
Yeah, I know...
Look, maybe I should just...
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Right.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Paris?
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Who?  Who came?
...I understand...
Yes.
Yes.  Is he there?
Yes, I'm here...
That'd be great.
I hadn't heard.
Excuse me?
Okay.
Yes.
Did you?
Really.
Thanks.
Not really.
Think I could rent a scooter?
This your store?
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
I can't protect you anymore.
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.

We have to keep moving.

I won't let that happen.

Stop where you are.

You could do that?
Go back to the hotel.
I don't know.
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.
Nykwana Wombosi.
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
Who paid the bill?
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
-- forget it --
-- how? --
-- there's no time --
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
I didn't know this would happen.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
No.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- let me do this, okay? --
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- just --
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
Go ahead.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
I guess so.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Thanks for the ride.
I don't remember any of this.
I guess.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
I thought about it.  I don't know.
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
I can't believe I slept.
Where are we?
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I was shot twice in the back.
I don't know.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Nothing.  It's just not there.
No.
That's what I'm saying.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
Listen to what you want.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
I know that.
Then I'll find another ride.
I won't hurt you.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
I said ten thousand.
I want to go home.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
You don't want the police any more than I do.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
I've got a situation here and --
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I need a ride out of here.
I need a ride.
-- here we go -- I found it --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? --
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in --
Shit, we didn't sign in.
Where did this body go?
I'm sorry.
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
Get everyone down in the basement.
Get in the basement.
He run away often?
Where's the dog?
