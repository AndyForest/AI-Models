You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
We don't know what we're into!
Forget it.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
-- he went inside! --
This doesn't go upstairs.
No.  We can't risk it.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
I'm not asking.
I want a second opinion.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
And what if I couldn't do that?
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
Yes.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
