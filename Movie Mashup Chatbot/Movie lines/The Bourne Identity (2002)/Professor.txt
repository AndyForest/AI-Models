...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...

...it's a problem...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...which one are you?...
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
