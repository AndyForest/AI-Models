Maybe we lost them.
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Who gives a shit about aft?
With who?
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Shut up!
Where are my men?
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
Not an option.
We were talking about my schedule...
I have a schedule...
How soon can we get up and running?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
And no questions asked.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
Which question is that?
And where is our point of arrival?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
You want some too?
Where are you going?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
I mean...where is everbody?
Where is everybody?
