Where's you friend?
I don't take orders at all.
No...
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
And what if I run into one of those things?
You want ME to go up there?
How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
Finnegan...
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
What?
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
You should talk...
We can't just leave them here.
What is it?
What's the matter?
You're saying they can think?
How do you know that?
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
Right... You have a boat.
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
I don't know where it is!
Takes one to know one.
Self sufficient...
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Seen a lot of islands?
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Thank you, I work at it...
I'm not rich people.
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
You don't have to be so touchy.
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
What are those things?
Noooo!
You hear that?
What are you people talking about?
Then who are you?
The thieves.
Who asked you to!
Now look what you did!
I'm not staying here!
Why don't you back off?
Nowhere...
A passenger...
Poolside?
Or maybe not.
