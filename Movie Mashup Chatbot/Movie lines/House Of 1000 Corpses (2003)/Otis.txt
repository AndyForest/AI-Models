You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Let's go see.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.

Well, go get her.
Get in... now!
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy...
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
