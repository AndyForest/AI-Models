Lock the fucking doors.
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Yeah, showtime for what?
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Turn that fucking radio off!
Honk at him. Scare him.
Here he comes.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Oh.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
How's he get around out here?
How long is that gonna take?
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
Help, help us.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
What are you laughing at?
Shhhhhh.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
When you were outside with Bill.
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
So what?
Yeah?
Why?
So.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
Oh, yeah.
Fuck, it's freezing.
That seems likely.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
I don't want to see that.
Tickets for what?
Huh?
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Jesus Christ.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
What? I didn't hear anything.
I don't know... about half an hour.
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
I can't believe...
You got to be fucking joking.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Rise and shine.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
