Why? You gonna do something about it?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Fucking great.
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
What the hell are you laughing about?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
What?
Wondering what?
Can I help you with something?
Nice.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Drive through it!
What are you doing!
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
How much is a person supposed to stand?
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Check this out.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
What!
What?
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Go around him.
Why are we stopping?
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
She looks like a freak.
Should we stop?
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
A couple hours!
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
I still don't.
I don't hear anything.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
What was that?
How long has it been?
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
Don't even say it.
She looks like she stinks.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Maybe he's a cyborg.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
Tell me about it.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
I resign.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Sleeping.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Enough with the stupid voices.
What!
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
You said it, not me.
Just back up.
Huh?
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Sorry.
No, just a little too old.
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Where is he?
Where's Bill?
Why? Why are you doing this?
