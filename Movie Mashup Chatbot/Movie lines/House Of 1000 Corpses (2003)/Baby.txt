Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Cone.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Who's your Daddy!
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Drink up, it's party time.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Ma, Tiny's in.
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
Tiny's home.
Whoopie fucking doo.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
A dead one.
You're welcome.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Yeah, come on.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Come on.
OK.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
Oh yeah, the tree.
Couple more miles up this road.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
Yeah, I'll do something.
You shouldn't a done that.
He walks, duh.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
You know... a couple of queers.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
I was just wondering.
I'd like to see that.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
What's this?
Come on, bro. Let's go.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Great story Goober, how much?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Now, what makes you think that?
