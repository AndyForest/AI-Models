Enough talk, write.
How's about you give me those same directions.
Is that all... think real hard.
And...
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Come on, get with the facts.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
What I need are some answers.
Yep, I found something.
God damn.
Yep, I suppose it is.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Not yet.
Yeah, no mercy here.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Thank you.
Please, just a minute.
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Mr. Willis?
Over.
Excuse me for a second.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
That must be him.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Aw, fuck.
I always favored the Hulk.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
