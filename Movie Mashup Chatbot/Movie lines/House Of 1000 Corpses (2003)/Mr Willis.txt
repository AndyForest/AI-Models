Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Right.
Call Wydell.
Tell it to my daughter.
We gotta break it open.
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Shhhh... you hear that?
Where we headed?
My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Fit the profile?
George Willis...  ...any leads?
I pray to God there is.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
What about the body you found?
Dr. Satan?
That's it?
Yes, sir.
