Hey, great they're back.
That's not something to joke about.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
Thank you.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
He left!
Is your brother ready to go?
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
OK.
Well, yeah, kind of.
How much further?
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
Which way?
What about the tree?
Where's that?
No, no I think it's really interesting.
But suppose for a second you did.
But if you did.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
You mean John Wayne?
The Duke?
No, really.
How long have you been running this place?
Almost there.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Thanks.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
She looks like she stinks.
Way out here?
What's that?
I don't know.
How much further?
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
How awesome?
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Perfect.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Yeah.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Yeah, no shit.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Man, it's already ten thirty.
Just grin and bear it.
What's he so excited about?
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Fuck! We are fucked!
He won't move.
I like sleep.
It won't work.
I gotta open the gate.
Quiet.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Forget it. I'll just go.
Fine! I'll go straight!
Fine. I'll go straight.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Hey, he moved.
There's not enough room.
There's a dog in the road.
Where ya headed?
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
It's a girl.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
