Murderer!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
How 'bout three out of five?
Are you peeking?
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
B-3.
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
Hey, watch it!
I can't see a thing!
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Will you quit moving around?!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
That ain't no happy child.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Toss 'im overboard!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
You murdering dog!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
You are a liar!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Who is it this time?
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Laser-envy.
A lunchbox...?!
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
