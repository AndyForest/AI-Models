Let's let Molly open one.
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
What?  What is it?
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Where was the last place you left him?
Next stop...
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
No, I haven't seen him.
You can bring ONE toy...
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Whadda ya think?
