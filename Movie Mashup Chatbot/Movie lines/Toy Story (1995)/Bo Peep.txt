Mm-hmmmmm.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Rocky!  The ramp!
What are you doing over there?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
