Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
We're not aiming for the truck!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Not today!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Woody!  The rocket!
Look out!!
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
Hold on, Woody!
Woody!
What?!
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
But why would Andy want me?
Yeah, right.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
Shhh!
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Woody, stop it!!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Shield your eyes!
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
Spaceship.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Sorry.
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Well, then let's climb abroad.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Go away.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
According to my nava-computer, the --
But we're not on my planet, are we?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Then we've no time to lose!!
Trouble?!  Where?!
I could have stopped him.
You mean that happy child?
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
I'd better take a look anyway.
What's going on?
Where?
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Can!
Yes, I can.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Toy?
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Watch yourself!!
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
HO-YAAAHH!!!
