I got it, Woody!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
It's Sid!
What the heck is up there?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
I can't hold on much longer!
Woody!  Speed up!
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Woody?!
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Got it.
Bad news?!
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
I'm red this time.
Right here, Woody!
