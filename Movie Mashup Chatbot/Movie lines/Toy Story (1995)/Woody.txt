Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
We're almost there.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Ha-ha!!
Hold still, Buzz!
The match!
Great!
Well, thanks for the ride.
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
Shhhhhhh!
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Yes Sir!
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Come on, this way!
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
What happened to you?
Don't tell me what to do!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Alright Buzz, get ready...
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
No.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
Right?  Buddy?
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
THAT is Sid!
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
That's why.  Sid.
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
You can't!
No, you can't.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Hello-o-o...
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Hi!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Stay calm, everyone!!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
No, no, no, wait!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
No!  No, no, no, no!
Nothing.
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Alright!  That's it!
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
A lunchbox?!
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Okay, save your batteries!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
I was close to being scared that time.
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
There.
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Last present!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
That's right.  Your toys.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Reach for the sky!!
Sid!!!
This is ludicrous.
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Uh-oh.
Slink!  Hang on!
Speed up!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
No, Slink --
Hey, Slinky?
