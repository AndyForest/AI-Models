Which one can I open first?
Here!  In the car!
Woody!  Buzz!
Hey!  Wow!
Bye, house.
But what if we leave them behind?
He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
Right here in the van.
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Yeah?!
Can I help pump the gas?
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Okay...
But Mom, I can't find him!
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Just one?
Can I bring some toys?
Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
To infinity and beyond!
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Yeah!
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Wow!  Cool!
