Does that say Xanax?
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
They perk me right up.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
