Thrr...
...Two...
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
Who knows?
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Not now Bork.
Agent Hurley...
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
That's better. Yes?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Deep and hard.
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
You see what I see, Bork?
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Talk ta me, Bork.
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
