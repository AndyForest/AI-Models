Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Yer late.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
She sure does.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
