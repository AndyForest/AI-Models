Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
So?
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
