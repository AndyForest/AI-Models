Yes!  Stay put, goddamn it!  Don't move from that spot...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Where are you, what floor?
...he's two floors below you.
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
Dmitri hired him!  He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  He was stalking you when I dropped you off.  I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Max, the cab driver!
Annie...it's Max.
Sure thing.
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Dozen times a day.
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
You need a vacation.
But not now?
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
Big case?
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
You like being a lawyer?
Travel...and things.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
It's no big deal.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
You like Bach?
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
The ride is free.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Sixth is faster.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
I'm...fine.  Fine.
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
Yes.
By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Wouldn't dream of it.
In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?
I picked up a tail.
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
I think...
Can't say that I do.
I'm sorry.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
I'm standing right here.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
He paid for 'em.
You're gonna cheer up.
I brought you flowers.
I got caught up at work.
Hi, Ma.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
You're kidding me.
I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere.
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
Yeah?
It got crashed!  I didn't...
Yeah?  So?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
He'll keep calling.
Let her go.
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Vincent?
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
None of your business.
Answer the question.
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
What happened to you?
Then what are you?
That's the reason?
What'd they do?
That's what you said...
You're full of shit.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
One more.
What's at Union Station?
Some living.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
No, not just that.
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
You had to kill Heller?!
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
I don't know.
Who?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
Makes two of us.
Paid sick leave?
You get benefits?
In case he asks.
How long have you been a hit man?
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
I don't get it.
Dmitri?
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Why?
Doesn't cover everything.
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
It's not bullshit.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
Yeah?  What happened?
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Don't start.
Jazz.
You'd do her a favor.
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
What difference does it make?
She's in the hospital.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
Leave me alone.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
No.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Let him go, Vincent.
I'm not catching a melody.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
I never learned jazz.
I listen to classical.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
Am I collateral?
Vincent?
I don't understand...
What?
Yeah.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
I need the job.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
Why?
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
I can't believe this.
Please.  Don't do anything.
How?
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
I don't know any Rwandans.
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Who was he?
How can you kill him like that?
What'd he do to you?
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Music.
Yes.
You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this...
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
You said you were visiting friends!
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
South Central.
It's a mess.
I think so.
What?
Okay, try it now.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I tried it.
It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
It's not me.
I'm trying...
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
Yeah.
I don't think I can do this.
The trunk?
With what?
I'm cool.
You're cool.
You - you killed him?
I think he's dead.
Yeah, yeah.  Shit, man.  Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
Max.
Two, two-fifty.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Me, specifically?
It's not that kind of job.
You mean like benefits?
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
I see your point.
It's home.
First time in New York?
An apology.
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
Twenty-four minutes.
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Oh.  Sorry.
