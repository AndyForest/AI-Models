This isn't our goddamn game!
Not our call, Phil.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
Pick me up in five minutes.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Elvis?
Oh?
So?  It was a random thing.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
What thing?
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
What homicide?  Phil.  Where's a body? Look.  All we got is glass...
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
You guys been holding hands?
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
