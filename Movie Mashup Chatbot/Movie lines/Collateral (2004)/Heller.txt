What are you gonna do?
I don't know...
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
Something going on?
...if they're wrong?!
What if they're wrong?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives.  Wiseguys.  I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
I never bought that.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
