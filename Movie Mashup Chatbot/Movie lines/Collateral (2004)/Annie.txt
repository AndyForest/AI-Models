I used to play this piece back in high school.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
Go ahead, say it.
You got a deal.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
What?
