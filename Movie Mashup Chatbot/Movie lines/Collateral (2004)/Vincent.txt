Then let's have it.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
Of course.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
'Fraid so.
The crowd had to dig it.
Remember what you played?
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
No.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
Jesus...
You're kidding me.
Of course!
I'm in town for a short time.
Vincent...
Quite an achievement...
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Tell me about it.
It's nothing.
I was with Max when he got the call.
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
No harm done, ma'am.
Hang on.  Carefully...
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
You hassling my driver again?
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
He's not paying you one cent!
What happens if you don't?
Max?
Well.  That was brilliant.
Slow down!
Slow the hell down!
You're going too fast.
Slow down.
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
As in...?
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
...indifferent.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
And you believe me...?
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
There you go...!
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
Head towards Union Station.
It's what I do for a living.
Yeah, that.
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
Who's Heller?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
Would you have called her?
You do impress me, Max.  That you do.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
No.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Why?
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
That's jazz, my friend.  You said it yourself.  So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
The man who hired me for this contract.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Gimme your wallet.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
What, no insurance?
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
Limos, huh?
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
Oh, I'm captivated.
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
You go every night?
Show up for <u>what?</u>
Show up for what?
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Max?  What are you doing?
What you mean, no?
Let's go.
Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
You mind?  I'm working here.
That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
Jazz.  Music.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
Yes, Max?
People in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work.  And for <u>you?</u> You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be.
Collateral damage.
Another collateral.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
No you don't.
So what?
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Who's that?
Because I have a gun and I say so.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Good luck.  You think they got families?
Believe it.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
Get rid of 'em.
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Play music.
What else calms you down?  Candy? Cigarettes?  Sex?  Breathe.
Are you breathing?
Tonight it is.
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
How long, you figure?
58th and Central.  You know it?
So?
What are you doing?
You better?
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps.
Try some deep breathing.
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
How about the thingy next to it?
What about that?
Two...
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
You listening to me?
Max.
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
It's a spasm!  Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
What?
Got it?
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
Did I stutter?  The trunk.  Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
Good.  Help me out here.
No.  You say you're cool.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
You always stutter?
Max?  I'm Vincent.
We have a deal.  What's your name?
I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time.
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
Like what?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Why not?
You should start a union.
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
You on some kind of work plan?
You prefer nights?
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
How long you think this'll take?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
Hello?
