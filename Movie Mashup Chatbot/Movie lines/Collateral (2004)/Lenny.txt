Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
Who is this?
Maaaaaax!
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
I was just tryin' to...to...

Who the hell is this?
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!

I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
