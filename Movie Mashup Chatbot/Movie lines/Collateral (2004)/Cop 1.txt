You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
You still carrying passengers?
A deer?
This your current address?
