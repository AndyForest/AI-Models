Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
Bus broke down.
Sounds familiar.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Gene.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
It's time to make amends.
-- It's not me!
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
Sure. What do you want to know.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
You'll be back.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Pardon?
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
