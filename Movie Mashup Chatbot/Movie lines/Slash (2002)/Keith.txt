Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
See?
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
What's a "little while?"
Alright!
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Hey. Fuck you.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
He started it.
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
Who you callin' "boy?"
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Who? Us?!
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Chicken sandwich?
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
Yes!
Shit!
