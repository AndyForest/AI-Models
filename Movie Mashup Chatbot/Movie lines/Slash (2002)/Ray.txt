Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
Ow!
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
Never heard of it.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Throw me one.
