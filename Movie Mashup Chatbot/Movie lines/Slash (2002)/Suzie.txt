The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Not lately.
The band.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
...You any good with those?
Hi.
Which street corner?
Someone actually... employs you?
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Bitch.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Tramp.
Slut.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Carl, what are you doing?
Come on --
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
No shit.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Looks like the alternator.
He's right. You were behind.
Amen.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Down boy.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
The audience!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
I almost thought for a second...
...no... Mac... p-please...
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
No. Not without you --
Mac... let's get out of here.
No Mac, please... I --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
It's you. You and your father.
You're... limping.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
You never had trouble communicating before.
Mmmm -- so can I...
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Getting ready.
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
So?
What's wrong?
What about Jeremiah?
Then why go back now?
About what?
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Yeah?
What'll we do?
Why bother?
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
Carl.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
-- Where have you two been?
Second verse!
Like your guitar break.
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Spider.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
