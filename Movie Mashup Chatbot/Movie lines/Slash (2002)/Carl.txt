AAAAAAAAAAAA --
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Not someone -- Mac.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Sorry.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
I didn't do anything --
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
