Chicken blood on the crops.
Superstition.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
What are you talking about?
Meaning?
How'd he know I'd come?
I --
Amends...?
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
People say he was a murderer.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
I don't think so.
"Blood?"
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
I'll be fine here.
This is his room... isn't it?
Aunt Edith. How did she... die?
How... was she "called?"
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
You know who I am. You invited me.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Is that right?
How does it feel, Keith?
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Never.
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
Get out of here.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Don't look.
Suzie --
Listen to me --
No --
Suzie... No.
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
What are --
Wait a minute --
Suzie --
You wouldn't understand.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Look. You want to talk about this?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
I said that's enough!
Let it go.
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Nah. Just you.
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Name something.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
Nothing to tell.
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
