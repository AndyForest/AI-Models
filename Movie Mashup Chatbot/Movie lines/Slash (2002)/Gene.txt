You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Book of Jeremiah.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
