Deal.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
Where do I find you?
I have connections.
So what do I get in return?
So where do we begin?
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
A lot of people are looking for you.
Camila. Camila Valencias.
Last night. Do you know something?
Where are you?
Rosanna Guerrero.
[Who's that?]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[And left three more dead men.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
