Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
I'm not... easy.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
So you are going to talk me to death.
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
I don't know shit about you.
What do you want?
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
Am I a suspect?
No.
What am I doing here?
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
[I have a friend there.]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[South America.]
Where?
I show, you give me the information?
You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
Give me the address.
Where does he live?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
I'll call you tomorrow.
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
It's a little late.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
[What is his name?]
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[Daniel what?]
[What is his name?]
[How do you contact 'the Boss'?]
[Reina Rosas.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[What money?]
[Who's the boss?]
[Don't lie to me.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Who pays you?]
[How does it work?]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[How do I recognize him.]
Who's he?
[Who's he?]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[I believe you.]
[Where do I find him?]
[Who ordered it?]
[Ordered by who?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[Who are you?]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Drive.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[What do you mean?]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[I want you.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[I want you.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[The ransom was ten.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[You stole the drop.]
[And?]
[Lucky how?]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
I drink.
It's loaded.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Yes.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Yes or no?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Pinta...
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Maybe...
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
I came to visit you.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
Yeah, right...
But don't you stay in El Paso?
So how's business?
Nothing wrong.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
I'm here.
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
Be a swimmer.
Then be trained.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
Still not a question.
That's not a question.
Could I stop you?
The blocks.
Your father has business.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
I know you're not.
I dropped her at home.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Two or three.
No.
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Don't worry. You will.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
No, that was in Columbia.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
You feel sorry for the husband?
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
Well, it's a sort of wife.
Why do you ask?
You need to practice.
In a week you should be fine.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Did you sleep alright?
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
Do you always sleep with him?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
Where?
They'll be back in a week.
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
Well, I let him go.
No.
Do you think he'll come back?
What are you doing?
You're fast.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
And don't start crying.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
No.
No.
That's right.
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
Time will tell.
I'm a bargain.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
I'm looking for potential.
No.
No.
The United States.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Who's Emilio?
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
If they like me.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
Then don't come.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Because...  I was already dead.
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Sorry.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
No.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
I'm fine.
Never.
So are you.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
