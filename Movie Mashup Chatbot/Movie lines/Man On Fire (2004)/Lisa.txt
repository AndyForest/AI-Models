Creasy... Wait.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
Planned what?
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Jordan!
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
It makes it all seem so serious.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
How are you getting along with Pinta?
It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
You've done much of this work before?
You're American.
The world of our children. How dare they?
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
Don't forget your towel.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
You do?
This is Mr. Creasy.
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
Good news. You're going back to school.
You should be sleeping, baby.
She's young. She'll get over it.
He has to go.
It's not.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
Creasy.
He has to go, Samuel.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
She likes him.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
I think it's nice he's American.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
Our child's safety is at stake.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
