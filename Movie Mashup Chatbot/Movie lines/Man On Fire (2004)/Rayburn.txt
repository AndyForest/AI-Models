Different door. Not far from here.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
I said the plan was right here.
Creasy?
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
You mean a misfire?
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
What are you doing here?
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
You did something on impulse?
How long you staying, Crease?
You been working?
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Don't give me that bullshit.
So what's wrong?
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
What do you mean, I'm here?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
I can take care of myself.
That's what friends do.
Two tourists who never went home.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
I already ate.
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
He's not a cop killer.
