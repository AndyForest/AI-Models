No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
And what if amateurs try it?
How does it affect you?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
Is it loaded?
Have you used this type before?
What is it?
Show me, please.
Were you provided with a gun?
For an American she understands this country very well.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
For a year?
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Do you know what she told me last night?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
It will be a hard break.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
That's ridiculous.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
What? Who?
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Hmm?
I think it's fantastic.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Our daughter.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
