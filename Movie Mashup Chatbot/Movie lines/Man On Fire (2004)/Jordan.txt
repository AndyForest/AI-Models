She understands men.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[Yes.]
