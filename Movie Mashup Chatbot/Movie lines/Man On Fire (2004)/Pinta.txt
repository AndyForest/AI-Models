You got that right.
Dyslexic?
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Frank. Frankie.
You think too much?
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
You don't drink like you used to.
Could I ask you a question?
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
What's so important in Los Angeles?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
The gunshot holds no fear.
Are you afraid of me?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Where's my mother?
You were never late before, I was worried.
You're late.
Did you used to?
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
Yes.
I don't understand.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
Yes.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
My ankle.
Everywhere!
It hurts.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
It's better to be free, right?
How do you think he got out?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
I go to school, don't I?
I'm not crying.
Oh...
So you were unhappy?
Hmmm?
But why not?
Not at all?
Did you like school, Creasy?
We're taking a different way home.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Potential? I don't understand.
Why not?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
I know. But which state?
Where are you from, Creasy?
Creasy...
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Bye, Mom.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
I like him, Mom.
Yes, mom?
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
When?
I'm trying, mom.
