Sure.
Where's my father?
What's happening?
Not much.
Hi.
You can keep them.
Stay the fuck away from me.
No. That wasn't the deal.
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
HE did. I've seen him.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
You did this before, right?
Let me alone, will you?
No!
This isn't for real.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
Who are you?
It's just a puzzle box.
Oh Christ.
I don't remember.
Please listen to me --
It's important.
I have to speak to my father.
Frank --
Bastard.
You bastard --
Oh my God.
This isn't happening.
You want it?
No.
This isn't happening.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
No.
No.
Julia!
Oh my God.
I saw everything.
I was here this afternoon.
I have to see my father.
Where's Daddy?
Sure.
What happened?
Which is where?
Hi. I got soaked.
Steve.
You wouldn't believe me.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Who brought me in here?
Wait a moment --
What happened to me?
I have to get out.
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Get the fuck out of here.
Yes!
I want to see.
I don't believe it.
Gone?
Finished?
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
I have to talk to you.
Sure.
What?
Really?
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Maybe you should give it some time.
I love you too.
Yeah.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
I've forgotten.
Sure.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Surprise.
Is Julia here?
Me like.
Big house.
I will. See you.
Take care, Dad.
Of course. Every day.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Great.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
YOU'D like my room.
No Dad.
I said: I found a room.
I found a room.
I got through.
Daddy?
'Bye.
Sure. Why not?
Will you GO, damn you?
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Don't let them take me, Steve --
These THINGS... they want to take me --
Steve. Thank God you came.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
No, it's good to see you.
If I make it through the day.
I've been better.
Oh!
It's not what I heard.
Oh no?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
She's so damn... English.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
What do we do if there isn't?
All right.  No. That's nice.
Not that late.
You know I do know the way home.
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
I'm here.
I AM house-trained.
Just upstairs.
I won't be able to stand.
That's right. Cointreau.
