'Bye.
I'll come back later, huh?
What did I say?
What?
I won't let anybody take you.
What's wrong?
What things?
What happened to you?
It's a fetish of mine.
Can I lend you a hand?
Are you busy after work ?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Your father told me you were working here.
Are you alright ?
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Oh no.
We're not all frigid.
I beg your pardon?
Meaning what?
I see.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
We walk.
If there's a train.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
It's late.
I thought we'd lost you.
Need any help?
You're not going?
So lie down.
We're on the Cointreau.
