Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
Oh Christ.
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
You know, you're very beautiful.
Why don't you do the same?
Yeah, why don't I?
First time for everything.
I suppose not.
What's going on?
This isn't the bedroom.
No personal details?
No, not much.
Is this your place ?
That's more like it.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Well, isn't it?
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
I suppose that's right.
You know it's not often I... you know...
Oh?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
Plain soda?
What are you drinking?
I wonder, maybe...
Drinking alone.
Not much fun, is it?
