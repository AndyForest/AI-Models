Well we can't just stay here --
Maybe we should just leave --
Don't you care?
That's probably her now. Or the police.
She'll tell them everything...
I said no.
I don't.
Yes. They'll never find us.
And the blood let you out?
So you were cheated.
You're still afraid.
Who did?
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Hell...
What kind of doors?
Let me see.
A box?
You promised me an explanation.
Tell me, damn you.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Later.
Well?
You're hurting.
Keep your voice down.
Who?
Good.
Hurting.
What do you want me to do.
Ssh!
Back from where?
What happened to you?
No. God no.
Tell me who you are.
Who are you?
Oh my God.
I'm very happy.
What about Larry --
But you said --
Well?
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Oh.
That's right. Who are you?
No, damn you --
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
This afternoon.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
Of course. There's no need to shout.
What's the problem?
Kirsty? It's very late.
The keys are in the kitchen.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Just to your left.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Kirsty.
Dead.
It's better you see for yourself --
I don't know where to begin...
Please. I can't bear it...
Please...
Don't go upstairs.
Larry...
-- I'll go see.
Fine.
I've seen worse.
Who was it?
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
I'll be down in a minute
Maybe a brandy.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Just feeling a bit sick.
I'm here.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Larry....
No you won't.
You're done worse.
Take it slowly.
No, you're not.
It's probably going to need stitches.
Let me see.
You're NOT going to faint.
Is it deep?
What have you done?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
Why not?
He's here?
In here.
Larry!
No argument.
All right.
No. I'm not.
You mean we're moving in?
I thought half of it was your brother's?
Not exactly modern.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
How long since you were here?
It smells damp.
Just a thought --
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
We're going to freeze to death.
What's wrong?
Am I?
Maybe I will.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
That's right.
I prefer the floor.
We don't need a bed, do we?
No.
That's right.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
Do you care ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
I... suppose so, yes.
You want something to drink?
There's a first time for everything.
That depends.
Please.
Just soda.
Not much.
What?
