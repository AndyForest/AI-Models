We've got such sights to show you --
Just in time.
We want the man who did this --
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
Nobody escapes us.
Many times.
No time for argument.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
The box... you opened it. We came.
