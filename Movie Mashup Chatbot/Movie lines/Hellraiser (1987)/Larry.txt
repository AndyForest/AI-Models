You fucking ass-holes.
My fucking hand!
Christ!
Just take it slowly.
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
Julia's my second wife.
Her mother's dead.
Uh-huh.
Alright, let's give it another try.
It'll go in.
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
What are you talking about?
What's wrong?
What's wrong with you?
Huh?
Come with me then.
Oh baby.
What's wrong with you?
No. I'll do it.
Only I'll turn it off --
Are you all right?
Is this upsetting you?
Kirsty.
O.K.
O.K.
Sure.
Can I get you anything?
Oh, babe...
Are you all right?
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
Julia?
Are you O.K.?
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
I'll be scarred for life.
So damn stupid.
I'm going to throw up.
Shit.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
I cut myself.
How are you doing through there?
We'll move in Sunday.
Well?
He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
Where are you?
I hear you.
Oh Christ. Julia...
So what's the argument?
You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
You're still blaming me.
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
The best part of ten years.
It's just been empty a while.
Ah!
Like who?
O.K. O.K.
It's ONE of these.
Where are you going?
No. It's all over.
What's the problem?
Show her.
No you don't.
I'm afraid it's true.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
He's gone.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Of course.
Maybe all she needs is some company.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
It's like she's waiting for something.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
You don't like her at all do you?
I guess.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I love you, honey.
Never better. You sleep well.
Steve?
What are you drinking, love?
Are you O.K.?
Kitchen's through on your left.
Kirsty.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
You like?
Call me tomorrow.
O.K.
You will keep in touch.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Well come over, will you? See the place?
Well I want you to see the house.
Do you want me to come over?
You'd like the house.
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
What did you say?
Where are you?
Kirsty?
Who's there?
