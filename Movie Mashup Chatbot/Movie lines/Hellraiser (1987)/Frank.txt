That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Poor baby.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Some things have to be endured...
Come to Daddy.
One last time. Give me the box.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
Come to Daddy.
You remember.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
Kirsty?
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
So where's the harm?
You can't love him.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
You would be. They tore me apart.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
This is what began it.
A long time.
Not know.
What?
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
One more. Maybe two --
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
I'm hurting
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
...somebody...
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
Frank.
Help me.
I said: don't look.
Don't look at me.
Julia.
Sure you are.
Wedded bliss?
Forget him.
I don't want to see the dress.
I don't want to see the dress.
Well can I come in or not?
There is going to BE a wedding?
I came for the wedding.
I'm brother Frank.
You're Julia, right?
