We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Please. Get back into bed.
