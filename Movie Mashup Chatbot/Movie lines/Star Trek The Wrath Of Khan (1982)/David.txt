This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
But we can't just sit here -- !
So are we, it looks like.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
Mother, go back!
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Who --
Does that about do it?

Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...

Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.

No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.

I don't mean to intrude.
You can't!
We encoded four minutes --
He's on a build up to detonation!
It's the Genesis Wave!
We appear to have plenty of time.
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
I'm Doctor Marcus!
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
I don't know.
Don't you believe it.
What are you looking at?
Let go -- he can't -- !
