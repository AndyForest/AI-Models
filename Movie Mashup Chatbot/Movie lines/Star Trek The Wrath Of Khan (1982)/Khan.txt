Well done, Commander.
I see. Helmsman?
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
I shall avenge you --
Raise the shields...
Tactical!
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Rake her.
Visual --
Well?
No!
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Raise them --
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
Let them eat static.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Perhaps I no longer need to try.
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
Time's up, Admiral...
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Thirty seconds...
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
