Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Admiral on the bridge --
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Sir, you did it.
Phasers locked...
I can't get power, sir!
Trying, sir!
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Stop engines.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Honors -- hup!
Ready, sir.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Aft thrusters, sir.
I'll try, Captain.
Shields activated!
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
Aye, Captain.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
