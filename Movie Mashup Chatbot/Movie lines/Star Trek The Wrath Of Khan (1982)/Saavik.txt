What are <u>you</u> looking at?
Oh, I believe it.
The Admiral's son.
Only half of you would get there.
Aye, sir --
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Admiral on the bridge!
Understood, sir.
Aye, sir.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Aye, sir.
Power levels quite low, sir.
All stop, sir.
At what.
That was close --
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
<u>WHAT</u>?
How?
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
Admiral?
Stage Two of what?
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
Indeterminate life signs.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
On screen...
Reliant's command...
Who?
Energize defense fields.
Yes.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
I failed to resolve the situation.
I did not think so.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
May I speak, sir?
It is still regulation, Admiral.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
... No, sir. It has not.
Because... there was no way to win.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Any suggestions, Admiral?
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Prepare for warp speed.
Course heading, Captain?
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
You lied.
By the book...
Aye, sir.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
Aye, sir.
Never, sir.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Aye, sir.
He's very human.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
Fire all phasers...!
