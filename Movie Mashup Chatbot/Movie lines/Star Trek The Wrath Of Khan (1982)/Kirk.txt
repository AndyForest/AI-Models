Young. I feel young, Doctor.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
Now that's what I call a meal.
Our first order of business is survival.
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
They even killed the galley chief.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
Ah.
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
And who am I hiding from?
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Thank you.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Uh -- what are they?
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
I'm not a drama critic.
Physician, heal thyself.
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
You did this -- in a day?!
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Wait --
Carol!
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Is that what you came here to say?
I am truly sorry.
I'm trying, David.
It was just words.
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
I didn't expect anything.
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
How soon --
What?
It's a long story.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where's Dr. Marcus --
I'm Admiral Kirk...
KHAN!
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Genesis, what's that?
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
I'm going down to the station.
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Scotty -- what's left?
We'll be going to warp speed --
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Sensors, Captain?
Do it, while we have time.
On screen.
Scotty, let's have it.
Spock?
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Try the emergency channels...
Uhura. Can't you augment?
He'll die -- !
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
Yes, Spock.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
The word is given: warp speed.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
And who is this?
Spock...!
... the good of the few...
Yes --
Spock!
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Uhura, patch me in --
Steady as you go...
Best speed, Scotty...
Scotty, can we make it inside?
Uh oh.
That's it?
What IS working around here?
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
It's all we've got.
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Gentlemen, this isn't --
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
The power of creation --
Yes.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
How far?
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
Or the one.
I would not presume to debate you.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
To be sure, Captain.
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
Home.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot�g�'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
In my quarters, Uhura.
Kirk here.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Dismiss the company.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Distance from Reliant...
Time!
Engine room! What's happening?!
Time from my mark...
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Hold your course. Look sharp...
They just don't want us going in there.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Erased...
Phasers on stun. Move out.
There is no such regulation.
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
HURRY.
Khan!
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Take the test again.
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
That was a little joke.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
You earned it.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
And why not?
Very well.
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Battle stations.
Try again.
<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Scotty!
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Visual.
Engage warp engines --
Stop engines.
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
I really must thank you.
