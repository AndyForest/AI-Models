This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
I still don't under --
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Is that a poem?
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Jim please --
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
... taking Genesis away from us...
... Can't read you... repeat...
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
David. Please.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
Jim --
David --
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Maybe...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
I know, I know...
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
