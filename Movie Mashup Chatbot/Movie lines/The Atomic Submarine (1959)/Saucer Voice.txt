It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.

Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
