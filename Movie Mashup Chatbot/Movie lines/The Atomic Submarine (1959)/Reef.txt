And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
I don't know.
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
Yes?
I'd sooner swim!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Your 'out.'  This came for you.
You could train someone else.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
How is he - ?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
Dave - !
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Well?
We'll have to look for them later.
Somewhere down there?
You hear that?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Listen!  Hear that?
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
'Us?'
We're stuck tight!
Cyclops?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
So they caught up with you, too?
Helen.  I appeal to you -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
Minus three.
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
But - what can we accomplish?
Right <u>at</u> him?
Thirty-four seconds!
You're sure it's Cyclops?
After torpedo room:  Report!
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
Who with?
I met Dr. Kent, once.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Why?
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
He did!
Swell!
- for horrors like yourself?
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
That's a <u>face</u>???
Come where?
