We hope!
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Right at our one-eyed friend!
What???
Course and speed?
What about down?
Is there any way out of it?
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
What????
Why do you say that?
Something wrong?
Yes, Griff?
What about time...?
Anything ---
Now they feel it...down below.
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Nothing we can do, now.
What?
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
We can <u>ram</u> him!
That's what I said!
What's the running time?
Take a look.
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
What do you think?
Huh?
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
All right - go to it.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Well, I'll be - !
See what?
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
