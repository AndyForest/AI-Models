What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Oh it does???
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
The sound again?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Yeah?
I think you're right.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
A lot of people think like that.
So?
I guess.
Huh?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
Reef!
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
The frogmen?
What course, Skipper?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
I...don't know!
Seems to be all around...
Right, Skipper.
