It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Wonderful!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
There's got to be an explanation!
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
