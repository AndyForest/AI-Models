All ready?
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
As we near the Pole...
What direction does the system indicate?
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
Under <u>water</u>?
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Toward the Pole!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
I'll be another!
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Thank you.
