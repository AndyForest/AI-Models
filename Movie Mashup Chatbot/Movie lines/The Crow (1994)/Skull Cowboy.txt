Very well, it's your ass.
You'll be alone.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Get it?
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
Miss her?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Interested?  Follow the crow.
