Don't interfere.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
No.  I have one more thing to do.
They couldn't do anything for me.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
It's only a flesh wound.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
My name.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
I saw it, too.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
In a better place.  I hope.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
I think he's yours, now.
Elly...
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
A remembrance.  A closure.
I have to go.
No.
Does she have a name?
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Mister Funboy lives there?
Who?
I dabble.  May I?
Victims.  Aren't we all.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Murderer.
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
You don't even remember...
It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
Do you know what you destroyed?
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
T-Bird?
Another jolly nickname?
Wrong answer.
Cute nickname, don't you think?
And how many lives have you destroyed?
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
I can see her.
Your pain ends now.
Does it hurt?
Neither.
Magic.
Don't waste my time.
I'm already alone.
Fine with me.
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
Shut up.
Go away.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Leave me alone -- !
Yes.
Shelly?
What the hell are you?
