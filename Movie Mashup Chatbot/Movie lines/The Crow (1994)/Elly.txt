They make you fart.
No onions though, okay?
You buying?
Talent. Hi.
It can't rain all the time.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
I lost my key.
Mom --?
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
What's going on...?
You gotta go now, I bet.
Do you feel okay.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
Mister Funboy.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
You look like a rock star without a job.
Mom tried to cook.
She's still dead.
I went to see a friend of mine.
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
Right.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
I don't know you.
