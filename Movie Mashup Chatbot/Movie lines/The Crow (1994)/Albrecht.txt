I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Who ever made that.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
No onions?
I'm buying.
Care for a hot dog?
Thanks, babe.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Could be.
I knew that.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
Annie, I need a file.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
You're welcome.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
How 'bout the morgue?
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
I should be trying to stop you.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
Fucking A, my friend.
You don't say.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
No further.  I'm serious.
