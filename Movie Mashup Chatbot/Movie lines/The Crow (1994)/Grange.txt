I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Move in, guys.
I've got him if you want him.
We've got company.
Kill a dead guy?
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
That thing is poisonous.
What... the hell is that?
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
