Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Sure.
O.K.! Send that!
June? That's my wife's name.
Next month is June.
Send that.
Sure.
Back is in New York.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
How?
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Sure.
In New York.
How?
What'll I say?
I was never stiffer in my life.
Who won?
That's fine.
She's in New York.
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Hello, Denby!
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
So what?
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
I can see you're no gentleman--
What?
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
