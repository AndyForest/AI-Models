No-o!
Did you find it?
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
Will you pardon me?
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
That goes two ways.
I thought you were a sucker--
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
How's your mother feeling?
It's your deal.
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Come in!
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
About twelve hundred.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff.
The country boy's about due.
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
Eh?... Oh.
