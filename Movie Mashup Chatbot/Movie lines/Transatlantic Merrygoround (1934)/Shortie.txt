On the drunk.
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Say--wait a minute!
<U>Me</U>!
Partners, ain't we?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Thank you, sir.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
You take some awful chances.
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
Are you screwy?
Now you're talkin'!
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Change?
No, sir?
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
This is a business trip!
--there's thousands of 'em!
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Not a chance.
A dollar forty.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
You don't think--?
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
I'll watch for him, sir.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
We coulda got two third-class!
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship.
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Cut it out.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Where do you live?
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Here you are, sir.
Because you ran after me.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Ain't got time.
Nothin'.
Telegrams.
