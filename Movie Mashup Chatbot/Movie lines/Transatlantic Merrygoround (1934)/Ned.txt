Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
Because I was yellow, I guess--
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
No!
Yes, Yes!
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
What!--are you crazy?
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Sure, Sis.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
