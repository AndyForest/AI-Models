I was counting on hours.
We better go back in.
Yee-hah!
Shut up.
Why not?
Yeah.
They're moving pretty fast.
I hope that's the cousin.
No.
Yeah, it's her job.
Dad, I'm sorry....
Sean's still out there.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Hey, come on....
I kind of had plans....
Yeah?
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Pop....
Oh, c'mon.
Okay, okay.
I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
Because.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
I'm going.
Do I have to?
What else is there to do?
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Maybe.
Great.
I will, I will.
Waiting for Andy.
Great.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
How old is your cousin?
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
I don't care.
Name it.
I can go out if I want to.
No.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
I'm not sure I can.
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
Would you take him?
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
Quiet!  Shhh!
No.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Eat Cheerios.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
How was dive class?
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
