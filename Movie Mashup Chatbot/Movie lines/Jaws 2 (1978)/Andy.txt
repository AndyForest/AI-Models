Sure you do -- you win either way.
But of course.
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
So's mine.
How fast is enough?
With butter, if they got any....
What the hell.  For you....
Well, I don't know....
You can?
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
Get on the rocks!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Don't!
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Someone pop your balloon?
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
It's not going to be easy.
Your dad must be really pissed.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?

Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Good.  It's terrible.

Why'd they decide to move?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
The Shark.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
I don't know.
Sean!  Catch it!
There's a shark....
You're betting what you already got.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
We're carrying weight.
