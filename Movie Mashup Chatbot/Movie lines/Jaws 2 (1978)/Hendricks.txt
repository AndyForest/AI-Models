See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
Hey -- you can't do that.
You're too close.  Back off.
Please.  It's my job.
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
I can't let you take her out.
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
Right.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
I know just where to go.
If there is, develop it!
What camera?
Oh.
Positive I.D.?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Chief?
We got a helluva tide this month.
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
I never heard of a 908.
Chief....
Happy to do it.
Till noon.  This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty.
Good morning!
Anything?
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
Yep.  Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Right after, the Kids went out?
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Oh, great.
What is it?
What the hell is it?
Until we find something.
Happens every season -- someone takes off.  Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
