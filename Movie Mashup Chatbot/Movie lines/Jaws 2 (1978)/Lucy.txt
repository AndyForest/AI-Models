But the island!
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Listen to Andy, Sean.
Where're we going?
Sean, baby, please....
Heading back?

What about me?
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
Faster!  Faster!
Coming about, then.
Who wouldn't.
Not tonight.
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
