Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Martin, it could be anything.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Don't push it this time.  If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Bullshit.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Are you serious?
We're alone.
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Be reasonable, please....
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
So?  So?
He thought he had a good reason.
Oh, my God....
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Wave to my son.
Brody's riding his tower.
Len, can I see you a minute?
