I'm supposed to.
I can't wait to get there.
When do we get to the lighthouse?
My hair's getting wet!
I want to go faster!
Wheee!  Faster!
Great!  Find one for me.
For me...?
Come on, you guys.
You going to the lighthouse?
What?
How fast does this go?
We're going to die.
It killed her.  It ate her.
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Now I really want to see it.
I've never been supercargo.
Is that me?
What's wrong?
I love it.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
I thought you were grounded.
Good.  I'll be on the dock at eight.  Eight o'clock, everybody!
You do everything your parents tell you?
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
It'll be fun, come on!
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
Is there something I don't know about?
Great.  I got some wine.
What's the lighthouse?
