What is it?  What's the matter?
What're you doing?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
I'll give notice.
What're you going to do today?
I know you did....
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Because of today?  The beach?
That you were fired.
What?
What's wrong?
Sean's asleep.
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
It was bad, wasn't it.
Do you?
All summer?
Terrific.
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Nothing, huh?
Careful.  What's wrong?
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
It's an island.  Got to run.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Where's my day book?
Eat Cheerios.
So's a donut.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Hey!  That's my boss!
As far as the office.
Mrs. Silvera.
Door's locked.
MMMmmmorning....
Let's get the kid home.
Fooling around?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Why?
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Where the hell were you?
Be careful....
Hurry, please.
I'm going.
Mike?  Our Mike?
What Kids?  Who went out?
