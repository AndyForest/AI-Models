Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
And sound.
Probably.
This is a mammal, not a fish.
What makes you think there might be?
Okay, so that's it.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Do you?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
We don't know that, do we?
What shark?
The whale's mouth?
The what?
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
First things first.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
