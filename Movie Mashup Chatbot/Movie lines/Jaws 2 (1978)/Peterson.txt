What's that supposed to mean?
You don't make enough.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
Is that what it is?
It came up during the meeting.
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Wait a minute....
May I have this dance?
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.

Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
What the hell is he doing?
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Oh, shit.
I think we got a couple of live ones.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
