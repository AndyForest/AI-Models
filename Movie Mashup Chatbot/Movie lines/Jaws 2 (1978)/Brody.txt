I need a hand here....
What is it?  What's there?
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
Tina!
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
Got it.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
I'm going out there.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Untie that rope.
Mike's out there.
You can't stop me.
How long ago?
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Not the drugstore!
You got it.
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up, did you look inside it?
What about that camera?
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
In here.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
On your own time?
Aren't you off-duty?
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
What?
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
It's okay.  What happened?
Mike?  Is that you?
No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
You want to come here a minute?
Michael.
Not till next year.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
You heard me.
You stay here a minute.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Every day?
Sailing?
Where to?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
What else you got?
Did you get any pictures?
You said something about a camera.
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
There is nothing to discuss.
My ass!
You're damn right that's what it is.
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Too late, it's written.
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
All of us thank you, okay?
Me neither.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Can't you tell?
So there's one around here.
Sound?
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Is there one in these waters?
That's it.
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
The Shark's mouth.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Look at that:
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
Mike's out there.
Going out.
Just one minute....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
What'd I say?
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
That's great.
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
The goddamn smell is always the same.
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
I know what you're going to say.
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
No.
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Nothing.
Oww!
Santos' place.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Damn.
For me?
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
In the den.
What're you guys doing today?
It's good with coffee.
Better yet.
Need a ride?
Mrs. Silvera?
Good.
Sean's awake.
Mmmm.
Home it is.
Right.
Listen -- what are you doing later?
I did, I did.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Because they're playing our song.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Do I have to talk to those two?
Late.
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
What?
Perfect.  Look at this ---
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Someone has to do something.
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Maybe they are!
Two of them are still missing!
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
It's still a good idea.
I know, I know....
We have to do something.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
When?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Yeah?  Then what?
Did he raise the Kids?
Where the hell is Air One?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
Sure they did....
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Hang on!
Hiya yourself.
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Some people.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
Shouldn't he be at home?
