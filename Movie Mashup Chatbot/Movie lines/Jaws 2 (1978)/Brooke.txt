What is it?
Too hot in the lighthouse?
The lighthouse?
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
That's awful.
It's all right, we're okay.
Shh.  Shhh....
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
I told you, remember?
You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
That's you.
Mike!  Are you going out?
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
I want you to meet my cousin.
You're not going out right away, are you?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
