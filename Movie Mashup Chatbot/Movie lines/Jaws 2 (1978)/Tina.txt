It's still there!
No!  It's still there!
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
And second?
What're we going to do in the mean time?
What about the others?
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
What about sailing?
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Double nope!
Nope.
With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon.  Tomorrow?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Take a break for a minute, okay?
