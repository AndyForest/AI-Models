Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
You're gonna be okay.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
And how would we neutralize him?
They could try to tranq him on land.
What?
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
No.
Oh, bullshit.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
Excuse me?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
<u>Jack</u>!
Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
He was an Indo-pacific.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
I'm just saying last resort.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
<u>Hector</u>.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
I never had sex with you!
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
Good thinking.
Probably not.
You think?
No.
Different worlds, Jack.
Likewise.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Yeah.
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Well...
He heeds a tourniquet.
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
We gotta get to Hector!!
Hector!!
Watch out!!
He's mooing.
He's floating.  Take it home.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Well...
Good idea.
Okay.
Alright, Jack!
What?
You calm down!
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
I'm not mushing it.
Thing we can lift it?
What?
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Night.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
It's okay.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
What are you talking about?
Excuse me?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
That's probably good.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Good luck.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Good.
That was an awful thing to say to me.
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I beg your pardon?
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I'd be able to see something.
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
Oh my God.
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
I'm not making it up.
So I don't like tents, why--
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
I <u>told</u> you.
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
How big do the bears get?
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Kelly Scott.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Wait.
Did you get him?
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Look ten feet into the water.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Hank!
Are you okay?
Hank?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
What was that?
<u>That</u> was a bust.
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
What is this?
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
I asked you to be nice to him.
I'm sorry.
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker.
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
You threw it at me!!
It looks like a branch.
What?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Gee.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
Sheriff.
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
It's just that--
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
You have a thing against museums?
What?
What kind of backup do we have?
You talk to the married couple?
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
And this is how he came to the boat?
This... how long did this attack go on for?
I can look at dead things.
Well.  At wakes.
I'm fine, thank you.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
Is the dead guy in there?
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Did he say anything?
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
I'm not even a field person.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Are you on drugs?
This is what we do?
Sorry?
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
A tooth?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
Yes, well...  famished.
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
That's not what you came to say.
Me too.
Absolutely.
Kevin, hey.
I really... I should get back.
Myra.
No.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
You and Kevin.
<u>You</u>?
<u>You</u>?
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
