We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
You killed him.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
Just those two.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
You take care.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Where?  Where?
You do?
We're ready.
The more he thrashes, the better.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
No way.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Hey!!
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
Get the gun.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
It was... something meeting you.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and...
If I'm ever in New York...
You sure?  I don't mind...
You wanna ride in my truck?
Get him onto shore.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
Take him.
Keep firing!
You wouldn't?
Hector.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
He looks like a giant tea bag.
It can't work.
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
Are we crazy?
We might as well pack.
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Look.
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
Calm down.
Really--
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
I heard something.
Ssssh!
We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
Well.  Goodnight.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Thank you.
No thanks.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Sorry.
Let's get away from the shore.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Like little children.  You okay?
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Just forget it.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
I didn't say it like that.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
You okay?  Kelly?
Good.  See ya soon.
He thinks they're what?
'Night.
Okay.  We're up at six.
I'm sorry but you're...
You flew up here because your boss--
It's too dangerous for--
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
What are you doing?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Baby crocs?
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
In Maine?
Who?
What?
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
Why are you here?  Really.
Never been to Maine before?
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
You too.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
If you get a safe shot...
Where is he?!
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
You said nobody came in here!
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
They look like they're jumping.
Are they feeding?
What's that?
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
Let's go.
We set?
