<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
I need to see his habitat.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
It happens when I land.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
You're a beautiful woman.
I don't know!
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
No!
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
So profound and fat.
Then do it!!
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
What's that?
<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
This is a setback.
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
Was he a good man?
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
No crocodile has ever--
They don't really attack underwater and--
This could end up saving your life,--
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
I'm laying a spring trap!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
Jesus Christ!!
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
And you like me.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
Cocktail?
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
You talk to Bickerman?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
Where is he?
Thank you, Jack.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
I got something on the screen.
You ready on shore?
Right.
That's actually the easy part.
We both know what they'll do.
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
Bastard bit my chopper.
He never said "go".
At school they'd always say "go" first.
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
He's gonna live?
Guess I finally got bit.
I'm okay.
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
Could we have intercourse?
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
Eh.  Fuck it.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
With crocodiles... everything's even.
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
Nothing's real.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
Are you sure?
As if.  Will you miss me?
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
Such the flirt.
What's going on?
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
That hurt my feelings.
