You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
No.  Do you?
Oh, yes.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
I'll sue you.
Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.

Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
