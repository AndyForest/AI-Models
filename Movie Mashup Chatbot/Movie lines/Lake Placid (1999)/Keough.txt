Go ahead.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Where is he?!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
I can arrest you!!
Raincheck.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
It came from across the lake.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
His head was just... bitten off.
Yup.
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Is this a trick?
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
I coulda shot you, you--
A spring trap!
You're crawling around like a--
What the hell are you doing?!!
I do <u>not</u> like you.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
No!!  Out!
Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
We are here on official business.
Keystone what?
We'd only just met.
Around here.  Yeah.
And what would he do come winter?
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
Mr. Cyr!
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
Thanks for your help.
He's done.  He's dying.
I'll take it!
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
Other than to eat us?
Now I'm gonna puke.
So does he.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
Obviously I was wrong!
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
White perch.
I'll call the coroner.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
I'm ready when you are.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
I guess.
Should I?
I don't know.  Back the truck--
That it's about to go wrong.
They're coming right in.
She's worried about the cow now.
What?
Look.
He said he knew Karate!
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
Yes.
Are you alright?
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
You think Jack's handsome?
Hector thinks you like him.
You like Jack?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
<u>Apologize</u>?
They don't believe her.
With what?
I just let go of it.
Hey!!
I thought I saw...
What the hell?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
Was he swallowed?
You're sort of a rude person.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
I got nothing against--
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
<u>We</u>?
Not yet.
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
Yes.
Seconds.  Three, four.
This is a little different.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
I wouldn't.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Yes.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
He just came up screaming.
