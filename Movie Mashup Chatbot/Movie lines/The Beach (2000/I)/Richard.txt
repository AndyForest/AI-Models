Thanks.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Just take it, OK.
Here.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Help you out?
Richard. Hi.
Yes?
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
I don't think so.
Traveler.
Fuck off.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
What happened?
A bit fucking late.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Big?
A shark fin?
What!
I think we're about half way.
Everyone ok?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
I don't know - I'm American.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
That's the wrong one.
Nice work.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Bonjour.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we donï¿½t try then we'll never know.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Exactly.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
I think so too.
Francoise -
No.
Swim?
So from there to there?
Hi there. Here, take a look.
Not too bad.
Eh - bonsoir.
Uh-huh.
So?
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
Where did you lose it?
