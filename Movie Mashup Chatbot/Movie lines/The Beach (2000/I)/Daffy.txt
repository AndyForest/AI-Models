Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
I'll share something with you.
Just five dollars, please.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm Daffy.
Excuse me.
