You can swim?
But he has been there, off course.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.

That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.

One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
Have you told someone?
We swim.
Hi.
I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
Did you sleep well?
Bonsoir.
