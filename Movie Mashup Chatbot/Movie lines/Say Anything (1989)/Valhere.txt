Certainly.
Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
