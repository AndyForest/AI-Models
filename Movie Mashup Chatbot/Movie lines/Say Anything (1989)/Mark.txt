You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
It's your castle, man.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Later for you, Luke.
We're full on bonded.
I love you man.
Give me my firebird keys!
I love you man
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
