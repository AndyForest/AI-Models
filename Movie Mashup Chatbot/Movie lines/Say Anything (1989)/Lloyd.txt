I'll be home soon.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
No, no, don't go in there.
I'll be in my office.
You're tough, J-man.
Yeah.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Hey, sis.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
I am.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
Read it.
I already did.
Alright.
So, what's your point?
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
I admit nothing.
See you tomorrow.
Hang in there, man.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front.
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Please?
C'mon, just do it.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Look at those eyes.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
I'm gonna call her.
What's a scam?
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
How's it going?
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
One more time would be nice.
What?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
You do?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Then don't do it.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
You told your dad?
Did you tell anybody?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Did you talk to Corey?
Is this because of your dad?
You shared it with a dick.
Yeah you do.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
It sounded like you did.
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
Okay, what did we just decide?
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions.
You need to study?
What's wrong?
Say what?
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
Why didn't you tell me?
It did?
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
I don't think I am.
I don't think so.
No.
Are you comfortable?
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Okay, this is important...
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah.  With potential.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
No.
It's okay, everybody does that.
What did you say?
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
Okay.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Okay, bye, I will.
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
Me?  Sure I do.
Won't you see me later?
After work?
Oh.
Mmmm.
I think you should wear that.
Nice one.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Yeah.
Today is tomorrow.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Job?  Being a great date.
Basic.  Hmmm.
What?
Twisted?
Watch out for that glass.
Sure I do.
It's just you and your dad, right?
That's cool then.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Have a good sleep.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
So we can finally talk?
No.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
No.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Yeah
Whoa.
Goodbye.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Pardon me?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party.  This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
So you're monumentally busy?
Are you busy on Saturday?
Are you busy on Friday?
Busy?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yeah.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Look at those eyes.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
I know this part, keep reading.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
I know
I know.
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
I'm totally and completely serious.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
How do you pay for one of those?
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
No.
No.
Uh... okay... um...
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Diane Court.
My car.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
What?
No way.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
How you doin', brother?
Alright.  Key?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
I called her up.
Yeah.
What?
Hey.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I don't know.
I was just going to kind of move around.
I was gonna...
Oh, I was just going to...
You know Diane Court?
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Yeah, alright.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
I love you too.
Alright!
