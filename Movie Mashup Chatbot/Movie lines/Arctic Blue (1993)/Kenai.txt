-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
