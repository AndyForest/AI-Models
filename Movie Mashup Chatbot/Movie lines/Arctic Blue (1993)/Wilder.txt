Back against the bars.  Now.
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
You better get some sleep.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
I got it from here.  Thanks.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
But I would.
No, I better stay at my post.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
I'm too old for this shit.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
