I don't want to talk any more.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
How did she..?
Oh.
Had?
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Six months.
Why?
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
The radio's on the fritz.
-- Corbett's a killer.
I was hoping you had some news --
Have you talked to Eric?
My home is here.  With you.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
You're hurt.
I'm staying.
So what's the problem?
Where's Corbett?
What's going on?
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
That's my line.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Wait a second.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
That's not what I meant.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Was there any trouble?
Did you catch Corbett?
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
I bet you haven't had lunch.
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
What are you doing?
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
