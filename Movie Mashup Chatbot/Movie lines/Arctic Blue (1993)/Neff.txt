You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
What's wrong?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
If Corbett's men find out --
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel!  Here, this is for you.
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
He saw you and Corbett come in...
Stay out of it.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Why the smirk?
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
