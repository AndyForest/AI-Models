It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Where'd you say Eric is?
What happened here?
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Alleged killer.
