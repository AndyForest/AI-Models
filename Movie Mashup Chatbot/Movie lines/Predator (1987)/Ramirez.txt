Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
There's no sign of it.
I think it's Hawkins.
I can't tell.
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
There's something else, Major...
