Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
What do you mean?
I'll see you there.
You know you can't win this one.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
We're not going.
We're going to need everyone.
No more games.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
What story did you give to Davis?
Why us?
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
Well somebody sent them.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
Mean anything to you?
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
This gets better by the minute.
Who's our back-up on this?
Go on.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Like the old days, Dillon.
You never did know when to quit.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
Thank you, Sergeant.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
You saw what?
What's got Billy so spooked?
Any sign of the hostages?
What's that, General?
What have you got in mind, General.
That's over the border, General.
It's been a long time, General.
He knows our defenses.
Where the hell is his body?
What in God's name...?
Hawkins?
What's he got?
Mmmnnn...?
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
