Something... in the trees...
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
