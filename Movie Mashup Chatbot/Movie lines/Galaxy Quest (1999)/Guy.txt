I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
How do you remember this stuff?
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
I am SO SICK of being right.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Something BAD happened here.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
It's ... incredible.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
Yeah, what is it?
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
They're still behind us...
...Okay

We're alive!
Not a clue. You?
Where'd they go? Back inside?
We're doing episode 31?

Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"
