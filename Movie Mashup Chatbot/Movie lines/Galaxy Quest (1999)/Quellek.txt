You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...

Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.

Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
