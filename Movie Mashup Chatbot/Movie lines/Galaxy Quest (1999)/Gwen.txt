He always has to make the big entrance.
No I didn't.
What?
Down there.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
I don't know.
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
Alex? Where are you going?
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
The ships are gaining...
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
All this from watching the.. historical records?
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
You could order something in.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
Alex you can't -just leave.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
The guy is terminally selfish!
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -

No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
We need another one.
It's fractured...
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
I never get tired of that joke.
What's the weather like outside?
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
We're getting major structural damage.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Oh, they're so cute.
Where are the miners?
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.

He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
Turn on the translation circuit.
Nothing. Hold please.
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Thank God. Are you okay?
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Clenched jaw...
How does the rolling help, actually?
Why does this sound so familiar?
You're playing your good side.
I could have held on to YOU! ...
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Computer, can it be repaired?
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
I don't think that's a cloud...
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
JASON...
Jason..
There's nobody here. Jason...
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Only answers to me.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...

How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
You gotta admit, they do love him.
