No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
I had the shot...
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
I heard something. A squeal.
What?  What?
You go first! There's no time!
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
Like YOU know?
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
At ease men.
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
Leadership....
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
"The show must go on."
You WILL go out there.
Come on, old friend...
That's It?
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
What?  Up?
Shit! Go!
No, wait, are you-
Okay, now. But-
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
How did you come to that conclusion?
But you don't?
What do you mean?
What does the Omega 13 do?
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
Yes...?
We'd never have the budget for this.
Okay...  Okay, now what.
Okay, we got it.
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
It's okay. Listen-
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
What's  your name, son?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Excuse me guys.
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Never mind, Fred....
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
It's... I don't know.
Your last name.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
All right. Put me back on with him.
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Mark 12.
Because it was on the show!
Gwen...
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
Right.
What the hell are you talking about?
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
What?  What did he say?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
It helps.
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Don't be ridiculous.
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Can it be repaired?
Are they behind us?
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Let me think. I need time to think.
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
Hey... Hey where are you going?
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Tell them? About...
C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
But I'm the Commander!
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
It's Jason...
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
You smiled at me.
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
We.. We lie.
We pretend...
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Stop, please! I don't know!
I don't know.
Yes.
All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
You can oc that?
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
A model, only as big as this.
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
Well... Sort of...
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Mathesar? What is that?
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
Former Commander?
Then how did he find out about the device?
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
Thanks
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Home.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
Catch me later, okay?
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Hold course, Laredo!
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
Let's do it, Tommy.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Practice driving, Tommy.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
It doesn't have eyes.
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
Okay... On what?
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
Okay, let's go.
Tommy, we have these...
Anything.
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
Do your best, Tommy...
Push It. Hold it down.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
I think we're going to exit the space port.
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
And determination.
I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
