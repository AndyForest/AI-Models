Don't speak, Quellek.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
Open.
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Thanks.
Is that the bathroom?
Where's my bed?
This is it?
Just don't.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
Yes. Good was done this .....
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
Nothing.
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
Go ahead!
Must be some sort of mining facility.
THIS much.
About this much.
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
We've got to stop!
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
"Just!?"
God, what an ass.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
...Damn you!  Damn you!
I won't and nothing you say-
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
And note the sucked in gut.
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
Shut up.
What's happened?
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
He wants to THINK!?
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
I played Richard III...
He's a twit!
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
Yes you did.
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
You said "the Commander.
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
Nobody was WATCHING?
Could they be the miners?
To see if there's a pub.
"Go into the cloud! ...
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
May I get the check?
We heard it the first time!
Oh my god, It's real.
Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
A boy comes to the door.
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
He's a miserable twit!
