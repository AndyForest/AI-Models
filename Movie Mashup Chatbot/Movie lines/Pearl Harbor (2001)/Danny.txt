I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
Sir, I --
Hale-what?
Sir?
You liked that?
Yes Sir.
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Yeah.
What the hell happened to you guys?
What lizard?
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
He did.
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
They ready, Earl?
I can't make it.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
It's shorter than our practice runway.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
We've always tried to beat each other.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Fun today.  Like old times.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
I'm out of fuel!
Home of the brave.
Little less.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
They're all over us!
It's tight.
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
Six P-40's.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Come on!
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
So what are you saying?
I was grieving too.
What facts are those?
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
Then why are you looking for her?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
Nah, you go on.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
How could you do this?
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
Home of the brave!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Kill the bastards!
Power dive!
Yeah.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Hang on.
From the air?
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Sorry.
I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
How's everything?
...He said that?
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
