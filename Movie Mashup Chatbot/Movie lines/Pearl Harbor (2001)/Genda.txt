If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
Brilliant, Admiral.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
