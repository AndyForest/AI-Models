You see us as capable of such a blow?
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
