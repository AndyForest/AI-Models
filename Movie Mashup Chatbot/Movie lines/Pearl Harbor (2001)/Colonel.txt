Too late for apologies, Walker.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
You're Walker, right?
