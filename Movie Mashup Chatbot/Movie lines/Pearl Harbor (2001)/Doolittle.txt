No baseball diamonds, Red.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
I know.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Explain what?
I heard what you did.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Don't get smart with me, son.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
