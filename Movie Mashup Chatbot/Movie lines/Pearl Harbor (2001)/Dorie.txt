You too, 'Mam.
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
Thank you, 'Mam.
Respect.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Yes'm.
Boxin'.
Sorry to trouble you.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
