And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
