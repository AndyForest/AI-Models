What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
You're welcome.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
He's right, you look horrible.
So I hear.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
He's fine. He's narrating.
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
I peeked.
Me? What can I do?
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
Do you know he won't expel him?
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
In a sense.
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Naturally you have copies.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Such as.
The hood jumper?
So whose car is it?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Want some help with that?
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
So -- what do we do now?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
The Chancellor's here? Now?
So what's the problem?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Ye-es?
The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out...
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
So modest.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Competence.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Kidnapped? By who?
James? My James? What's happened?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Tripp, where the hell...
Tripp?!
Where would we go?
Back up. Go out the other way.
Just go around him.
Hit your brakes.
Tripp.
That was good.
Because... because...
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
He is. Take my word for it.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
So. Is he any good?
He finished it Winter Break.
He has a book.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
Left you...? Who? Emily?
Trip??
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
I thought you were tinkering.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
Mm.
You're stoned.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Your wife.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...
Tripp!
