Thank you.
It's the Chancellor.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
You snore.
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
The candelabras were my Gran's.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
Actually... I just want to go home.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
Even if I end up going to jail....
Professor Tripp...?
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
I'm not going, with them.
I'm not going with them.
Where you going?
Okay.
When?
It's because you don't eat.
What would you call them then?
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Want a bite?
You coming?
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
I'm sorry.
But, last night...
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
You're lying.
Jealous? Of me?
Because of my coat?
It's warm.
So, why did you take me up there?
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
I just wanted a little sip.
It feels really... good... here.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Maybe she didn't come here.
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
You can see the outline of a butt.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
The one that left you?
Kinship. And what's here?
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
When we fall, we fall hard.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Outside Scranton.
Carvel.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Colon cancer.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Humboldt County?
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
No.
She seemed to take it pretty well.
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Isn't this...?
Who?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
The bus station.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
How's that?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
How did I get here last night?
Professor Tripp?
Blocked.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
That's a big book you're writing.
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
Yes.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
The guy on the phone.
He didn't give his name.
Want me to get that?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
I put you on the floor.
Thank you.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Can I ask you something about her?
Whose tuba is that anyway?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
You?
What are we going to do with...
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
I had to. Didn't I?
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
They're glass. The buttons.
Really?
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Is that really it?
I'll miss my bus.
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
It's colder in there.
A little.
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
It's not bad.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
No! What gave you that idea?
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
There's so many...
Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room.
George Sanders?
No, I'm going ho --
