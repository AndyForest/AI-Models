You peeked, didn't you?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
No. But I don't think that matters.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Came to my senses.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
He was never able to reproduce them.
That was MacCaulay.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Call it a hunch.
No wonder he screwed us over.
...we find the jacket.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
Don't touch it.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Find the jacket.
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
Evidently.  Coming!
Who do you think it is?
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
Shut up, James.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
Is he awake?
Crabtree.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
So sensitive.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
What's to tell?
Which is?
How bad is it for you?
Only in your bones?
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
Maybe... I don't know.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
His parents.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
You stay there.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Shit.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Shit.
What's this guy's problem?
Yes.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
He heard everything we were saying.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
He lives with his mother.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Not Curtis.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Shut up and drink.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
No. Not yet he isn't.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
Is that just beer?
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
She left me. Crabs.
He said something about being between things.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
I just mean...
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Isn't she?
She's still a transvestite.
She's a transvestite.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Emily?
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
How are you, Crabtree?
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
No...
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
How are you -- is it Joe?
You must be mistaken.
It's mine.
Excuse me?
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
She told you about...
I know.
Is that in my chart?
I've been trying to finish a book...
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
The last month maybe.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
I've been doing that a lot lately.
I passed out.
Sure.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Boy or girl?
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
'Fraid so.
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
No, really...
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Relax, Vernon...
Who's got a gun?
Vernon.
Yea?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
...reconcile with Emily.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Yes. But that's not why I called...
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
Hello?
Yes, James.
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
I'm a little worried, James.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
Get out of here.
Near Carvel?
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
When nobody's looking.
I eat.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
No thanks.
In a minute. Get us a table.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
I didn't mean it that way.
I never said that.
The hell I am.
Not you. Your talent.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
What?
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
How can you tell?
That's right. That one.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
Kinship.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Amazing.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
What kind of dancer?
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
I never heard of it.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Where's that?
Jesus, James. Wow.
Glaucoma?
Maybe...
Your aunt?
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
Yeah, well, actually...
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Hm.
I don't know...  Me.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
But James. I mean... How long?
So where have you been staying?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Well done, James.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Hm.
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
Washed up?
But... ?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Afraid so.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
What'd you tell him?
What'd he say?
Who?
Sure.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
Oh.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
You're welcome.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
What's he saying?
Is he all right?
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Miss Sloviak's.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
I've got tenure.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Yea, James.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Right.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Like the lady herself.
Really.
Go ahead.
So I'm told.
That's really it.
This is worth it.
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
Heaven?
You're right.
So what are you doing out here?
You cold, James?
Really? That's remarkable.
Well...
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Sounds like a good one.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
...You carry firearms.
It's very convincing.
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
That good, huh?
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
He cribbed that from Borges.
But where? I need the street.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Jesus.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Hey.
Oh. Well. I...
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
That strikes me as odd.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
Do?
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
I thank you.
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Me? Sure. Why?
Thanks for that. He all right?
Yes, Hannah?
You don't deserve me, you know.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
Does he still love you?
Did you tell Walter?
I guess you have to go on faith.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Ouch. How many?
I know.
I lost it all.
I'm through improvising.
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
And what did you say?
He told you.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
I think I might have.
Would Walter really press charges?
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Someone stole my car.
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Inside.
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
Oh?
Sara.
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
James Leer.
About the baby.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
Really, Sara, I...
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Really? That was fast.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
I heard.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
You got me.
Caps.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Not have it.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Well...
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Is the thing -- is it over?
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Yes.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Hm.
Simple.
She's left the room before. She always came back.
Emily left me this morning.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
All right. This morning --
New?
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
I need to talk to you.
Easy there.
I got the message you called too.
Chancellor.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
He's writing his name in water.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Listen, Antonia --
I'm not sure that's possible.
James is... I don't know...
I'm your man.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
Lucky guess.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
The more the merrier.
No.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
I'm in love with your wife.
I... I...
This is important.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
It's Grady, Walter.
Walter?
As a heart attack.
Do you get high, Sam?
Yo, Traxler.
Taking the long way home.
Her husband.
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
I don't know. It might be...
Oh... yeah.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
Where's Emily, Hank?
Maybe I should read it.
And?
What made you pull out that old thing?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
I might have his number on campus.
Just kidding.
The perpetrator.
That's weird.
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
