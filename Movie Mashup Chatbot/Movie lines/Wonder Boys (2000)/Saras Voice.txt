How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Goodbye, Grady.
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
With Emily?
You're in Kinship?
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
