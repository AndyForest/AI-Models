Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Only when I'm working.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Who's that guy?
Sick.
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Is it good?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
