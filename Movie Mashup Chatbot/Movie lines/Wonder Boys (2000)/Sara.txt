I know, but sometimes...
Did you just make that up?
It didn't come up.
I told Walter.
Some times...
Oh?
Dozens. It's very sad.
And you're old.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I said it didn't sound like you.
He told me.
And what do you think you might have said?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
Are you sure you parked it there?
Grady.
And the jacket?
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
What's he doing out there?
Who's that sitting in your car?
That... and you.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
All right.
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
I'm kidding. Hello?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Did you confess?
You heard? How?
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
I love you, Grady.
Pow.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Who's gun is that?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Neither do I.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Is that Cristaile?
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
She's left before...
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
I'm sure.
I'm pregnant.
You go first.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
I got the message you called.
Professor Tripp.
You want to keep him happy.
I doubt it, darling.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
