Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Then move out of the way.
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
I am the dark master!
You're all part of Satan's army now!
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Ow, you're hurting me!
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
No! It can't be!
What if I just left?
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
Don't call me dumb!
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
You don't care.
I know.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
I am.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
