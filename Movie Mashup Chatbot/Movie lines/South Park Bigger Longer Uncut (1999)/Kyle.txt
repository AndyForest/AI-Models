CARTMAN!
Cartman?!
What Cartman?!
Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
Did you bring the pie and punch?
Your behind?
You're late, Cartman!
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
And she's getting worse...
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Hey Cartman.
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
Who the hell made up that law?!
I can't believe he's dead.
Oh.
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Look at that!
What's going on, Chef?
I don't know.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Yes I am!
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Donkey raping shit eater.
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
MOM!!!
What's that?
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
Dude, what the hell is going on?
Aw, ma!!
SHIT!
Okay.
Guess.
What's the password?
Who is it?
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
We can't leave without you!
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Be careful, dude.
Kay.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
What's a butfor?
Dude, we don't have watches.
That's gonna take a long time!
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
Oh my God...
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Thank you, Kenny.
WHAT?
Sweet.
Stan!
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
I thought you had something planned.
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
I'll just try the first one.
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Okay...
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Yeah, they suck.
This is sweet!!
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
I don't know, dude.
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Our moms suck!
It isn't fair!
You bastards!!
YOU BASTARD!!
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
That was sweet!
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
