Take them.
They're birds!
No!
If your father were here...
Yes, I did.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Cathy!
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
I started to say... inside...
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
If they are?
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
But they'll be back.
I mean. I want to...
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
Oh, my God, look at her!
Mitch...
I'm sorry, Mitch.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
What happens when we run out of wood?
Where will we go?
When?
Maybe we ought to leave.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
When do you think they'll come?
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
Tell him about the party.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Yes?
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
She was selling birds.
In a bird shop.
How long have you known her?
And certainly pretty.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
Whose side are you on?
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
Lovebirds, I see.
You did say birds?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Oh. I see.
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
A what?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Did you close the door?
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
I couldn't ask you to.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here.
I wish I could be that way.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Do I sound foolish to you?
Cathy. At the school.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
What good will they do?
Then he saw.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Where's Mitch?
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
