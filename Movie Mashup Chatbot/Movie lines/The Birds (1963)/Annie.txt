Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
Is anyone there?
Then go.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
That's up to you.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
She already has a daughter.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Because she was afraid.
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
San Francisco.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
How do you like our little hamlet?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
All right.
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
Would you like some brandy?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
Yes?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Actually, it's none of my business.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Cathy?
Yes?
Yes?
