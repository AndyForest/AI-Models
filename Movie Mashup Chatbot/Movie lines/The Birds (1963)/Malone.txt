There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
Goodnight, Lydia.
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
