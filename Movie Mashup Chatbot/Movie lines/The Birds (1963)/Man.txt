I'm awfully sorry.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
He's not home.
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
