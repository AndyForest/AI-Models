I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Yes, certainly.
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
I have no idea.
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
