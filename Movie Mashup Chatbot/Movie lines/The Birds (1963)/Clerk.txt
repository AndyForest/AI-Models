It's Alice.
It's Alice, ain't it?
The little Brenner girl.
It's nothing.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
The little Brenner girl?
Yep?
Okay.
What name?
D'you want me to order one for you?
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
And the white house?
See them two big trees across there?
See where I'm pointing?
Right across the bay there.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yep.
Yep.
Try my best.
Morning.
