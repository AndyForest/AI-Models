I think they'll be all right, honey.
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
I don't know, honey.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
They're back!
We'll make our own fog.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
Young woman cut herself.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
You don't have to.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
We'll worry about that when we get there.
They won't be.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We won't be here.
They're gone. The same pattern.
You're doing fine.
I can handle it.
Get a rope!
Mother, get a rope!
Shhh. Shhh.
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
That's a chance we have to take.
I don't know.
I got them all, Mother.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Mother?
I know, Mother.
Yes, Mother.
I know, Mother.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
Yes.
I told you. We met yesterday.
Yes.
Yes, very.
I'm simply quoting the law.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
He was killed last night. By birds.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Does this room look silly?
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
These birds were...
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Not by the thousands.
We know what it is, Al.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Wait here. Don't move.
The power.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
How about you?
Almost two a.m.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Maybe.
Inland.
Have we still got power?
Do you want to try your father again?
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
The bay doesn't.
We've got to get Cathy.
I think it's safe to get out now.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
Melanie...
No, no...
Melanie, Melanie...
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
What do you mean?
It's so damn quiet out there.
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
What it was, probably...
Take wing!
Hear, hear!
Hear!
Well, they'll go along with anything.
So they united.
Growing a beard...
Of birds?
Really? Tell me about it.
It smelled of the fire.
Are you staying?
Some cream?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Last night? What do you mean?
You look a little shaken.
Are you all right?
No, tell me.
What'll it say?
What?
I'm glad you do.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
Helping travelers.
Like what?
What do you do?
You have a job?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Cheers.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
What do you want ?
It is for me.
I think it could be fun.
I'd still like to see you.
Do you expect me to believe...?
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
Why?
But you tore it up.
What did it say?
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
You were lying.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
So you didn't go to school together.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
His wife changed the channel.
He was watching a ball game on television.
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Seven o'clock then.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
You are, aren't you?
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Right next to the one you already had.
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Can't see a thing.
What did it say?
You like me, huh?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
How do you know Annie?
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
What for?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Criminal.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
I am.  Good day.  Madam.
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
We met in court.
Ahhh, but I know you.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
All right.  She smiles back.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
How can you tell?
Are they moulting now?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
The sign says strawberry finches.
Aren't these lovebirds?
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
Lovebirds.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
I wonder if you could help me.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
With smoke.
Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
I'm not sure, but...
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
