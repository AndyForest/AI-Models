They haven't harmed anyone.
Mom, they're in a cage!
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
Mother!
Just listen to them!
Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Don't you like us?
Are you coming to my party?
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Just a little one.
Could I have a puff?
Is smoking fun?
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Miss Daniels?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
Mitch, let's turn back.
Is she all right?
Why are they trying to kill people?
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
What's the matter with them?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
