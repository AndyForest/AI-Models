Look.
Yes.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Do you think I should go?
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
And the second?
I did.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
I see.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I don't understand.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Then why did she object to you?
Then what was it?
And what had you done?
A trifle.
Different?
When was this?
What do you mean?
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
I suspected as much.
How'd you happen to come here?
Where are you from originally, Annie?
I despise it.
I think so.
Thank you.
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
If you have some, I'd...
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Yes.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I was wondering...
Yes, I did.
Thank you.
Lovebirds.
Yes.
Yes.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
No. Just a few hours.
It's a lovely garden.
No, not really.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Miss Hayworth?
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
I don't know yet.
Darling, of course I do!
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
I know.
I don't think your mother would like that.
Oh, I suppose so.
Your brother told me.
Well, I suppose...
Yes?
How much for the phone calls?
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
Thank you.
Yes?
I need her exact name, you see.
Are you sure?
Yes.
The little girl's name.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Daniels.
Thank you.
Of course.
Where would I get a boat?
It's a surprise, you see.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
I see. How do I get down there?
The two kids?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
That's where the Brenners live.
Yes?
Yes?
Where?
Yes, but where?
Where does he live?
Do you know him?
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
I wonder if you could help me.
Good morning.
Please.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
And locked it.
That's the last of it.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
I don't mind, really.
Would you like me to go for her?
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
And if you don't?
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Yes.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
No.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
What?
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
No, not exactly.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Oh.
Sixty...  Oh.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Well, where did he go?
Well, I...
Monday?
That's all right.
Yes.
Can we turn back?
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
No... wait.  Hold me.
Mitch...
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
You must be exhausted.
What time is it?
When will they stop?
Santa Rosa?
Where are they heading?
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
I keep thinking of Annie.
How long have they been gathering there?
The town looks clear.
Don't let's take any chances.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
...everything I know.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
After the gulls attacked.
It was like that yesterday.
With my little sparrow leading team.
Mmm?
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Certainly, of birds.
It's an uprising.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
I think I should, don't you?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
I'll get it.
No, thank you.
No, I have my things in the car.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Yes.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Yes.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
I do different things on different days.
I have several jobs.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Cheers.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
But not for me.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
Why?
I don't give a damn what you believe!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Yes.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
I wrote the letter.
Yes, I was lying.
No.
No.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Yes.
Yes, but...
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
Without any clothes on?
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Oh. That. Rome.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Will I be seeing you again?
Oh, yes.
What?
Why did he shoot her?
Famished.
Maybe.
I'm sure.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
With... with Annie, of course.
Certainly, but...
Yes, but...
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
Look, Mr. Brenner...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
Yes.
Oh, no you don't!
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
We... we went to school together. College.
Yes.
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Why...
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
Ouch!
Only violators and practical jokers.
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
What kind of law?
Do you practice here?
So you're a lawyer.
What's that?
What made it...
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
I think you're a louse.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
What are you? A policeman?
I didn't break that window!
When?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
How?
I don't know you.
Hey, wait a minute!
But how... how do you know my name?
What did you say?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
Some of them are.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Doesn't what make me...?
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
No, of course not.
I understand completely, sir.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
Lovebirds, sir?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
What?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
How soon?
Do you have any lovebirds?
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Have you got a pencil?
That... that... who was that?
There we are!
Well, all right, but...
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
Yes.
And he'll talk?
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
You said three o'clock.
What do you suppose it is?
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
Maybe! Is it impossible?
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
No one called it a war!
I don't know why.
To...  To kill them.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
What were the crows after at the school?
These weren't a few birds.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by.
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
