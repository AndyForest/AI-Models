Fun-ny. See you.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Well, are we still on for tonight?

We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
YEAH?
Go get me a beer.
Is that all you say?
Want a beer?

I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...

It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
