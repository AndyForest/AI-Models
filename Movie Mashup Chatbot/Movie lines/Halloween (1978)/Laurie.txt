Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Wait a minute here...
Yes, you can.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Fancy.
Annie!
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
What's this big, big news?
Thanks.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
He can still watch.
He was watching me.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
I wasn't spooked.
Sure, see you later.
I've already lost it.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
Annie, was that you?
Hello?
Okay. Bye.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Cute.
He was standing right here.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Behind that bush there.
Look.
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Shit!
Exploring uncharted territory?
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
Have a good time.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
I don't think so...
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
No! Do as I say.
I killed him...
Yes.
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
HURRY!
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Tommy, let me in!
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
I promise.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
What did he look like?
There was no one outside.
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
There is no such thing.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
After the movie.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Why are they under there?
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
See you.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
Just watch.
Yes, I am.
Sure. Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
Same time, same place.
Hi, Tommy.
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
