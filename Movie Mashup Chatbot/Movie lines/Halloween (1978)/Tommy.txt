Laurie, you come with us...
But you can't kill the bogyman.
How?
Are you sure?
Was it the bogyman?
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
I'm scared...
What is it, Laurie?
Who is it?
I saw him...
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
Promise?
Right.
The bogyman!
There WAS.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
No...
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
What about the bogyman?
What about the rest of my comic books?
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
Laurie...
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
Not any more.
I don't like that story.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Can we watch the monster movies?
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Are you coming over tonight?
Hey, Laurie...
