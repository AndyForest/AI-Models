He shouts, too.
Huh?
You blame everything on kids.
What happened?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Saving the treats for Bob?
What time?
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
We just talked.
That's not true. Here I am.
Why didn't you wait for me?
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
I can't.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
What's the pumpkin for?
That's probably all he can do.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Probably Mister Riddle.
Lies.
You still spooked?
Bye.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Of course.
Why did you hang up on me?
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
I don't see anything.
Look where?
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
I have a place for that.
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Come with me.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Get him out of here!
