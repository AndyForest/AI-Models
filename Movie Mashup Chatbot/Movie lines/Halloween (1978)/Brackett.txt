You're going to be late!
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
What?
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Where?
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
You all right?
I'll check back in an hour.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
What do we do?
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
A man wouldn't do that...
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Ten minutes.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
