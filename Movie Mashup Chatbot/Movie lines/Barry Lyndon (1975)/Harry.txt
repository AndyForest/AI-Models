Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
