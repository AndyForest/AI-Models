Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, papa.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Papa?
Good night, papa.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Did you buy the horse, papa?
