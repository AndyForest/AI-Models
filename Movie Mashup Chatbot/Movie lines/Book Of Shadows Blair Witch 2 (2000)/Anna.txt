Nick!!
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
--my God, Nick???
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
Closer.
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
Join the club.
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
Hey, folklore--
--which she may have--
I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
Inside the grave?
What're you doing there?
Domini?
--he's not my husband!
--I'm not staying here!
No!
I guess--
Something was wrong.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Why?
--Nick!!
I haven't killed any--
Looks like business is booming.
That's a joke?
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
Oh, sorry, right.
Not the only things missing, Nick.
So whoever built this--
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
The Witch's voice.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
--Christ almighty--
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
Why?
--no, what's wrong with you?
Whatever you want.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
I can't.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
No.
What?
I guess, yeah.
Nothing. I dunno--
Sleep.
--Cotter's--
Get your goddamn--
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
We've looked at half of one tape.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
I want to see the tapes.
--or someone--
Yes.
I don't know. Nightmare.
I don't know.
What?
--fine, later, fine.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Why is there no "our" here?
You don't want it though.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
What is <u>this</u>?
You sure?
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
What?
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
It's like traveling back in time.
