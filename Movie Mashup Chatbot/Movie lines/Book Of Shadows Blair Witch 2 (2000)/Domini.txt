--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Sometimes. Where are we going?
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Trying to find the energy.
Yes.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
So lemme see it.
--go!
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Turn the tapes back on.
Something. Someone.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
I don't know yet.
I don't think it was them.
No.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
--no, I think they're all in there.
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
Sometimes.
Both. Now.
I want amphetamines.
--and we brought it back with us!
Why she kills children.
No. I don't think so.
At least you still have the tapes.
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
Not planning on sleeping at all.
What?
Oooh. Oooh.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Why?
What is all this shit?
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
Get some more beer.
Sure. I'm sorry.
That's why she kills children.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That's the <u>reason</u>.
Jesus.
Are you alright?
What'd you say?
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
Still working on it.
Okay.
He'll never know.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
Then I have no idea.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
--no.
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
