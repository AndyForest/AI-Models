Oh, Jesus, no--
--like you hurt the baby--
I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
Are you marked like this??
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
I want to see something!
Then I'm going--
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
Here.
What'd you dream?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
Just now?
Was that you laughing?
--you should get back into bed.
What can I get you?
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
--now c'mon!
--bullshit!
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
I think we get the gist.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
--scared the living shit out of us.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
Baby names?
You said the name "James."
Anna--
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
Your body, your call.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
No--<u>this</u> is weird.
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
<u>Yes</u>.
No.
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
--<u>myth</u>--
--whatever; that's her.
That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.
Jesus.
So says her website.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
Cheery little place.
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
What?
--shit!!!
What're you nuts--
I can't!
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
I think it's time to get out of here.
Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
What--
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
Running a junk yard.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Let's get inside.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
--I dunno, I just woke up--
Asleep--
How're the cameras doing?
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
--now there.
Look over there.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
This isn't about us.
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
Cotter?
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
--turn the goddamn camera off!
--Cotter--
--Graduate Thesis--
--turn the camera off--
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
What?
Pointless.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
You planning on sleeping out there?
Ah, Domini?
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Ancient runes--
She got <u>paid</u>.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
I don't....
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
Why?
What the fuck's going on here?
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Anna--
She's far from "fine."
I should check on Anna.
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
Domini.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
Okay. Hypothetically.
Heather.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
--I know!
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
Finally got her back to sleep.
Whatever.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
--bullshit--
