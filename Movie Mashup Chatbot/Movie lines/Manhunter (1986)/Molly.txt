Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Maybe we should give it some time...
That's not true.
Will?  You could come up here.
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
I want to see you, too.
Will? Are you okay?
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Will...
William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
Is Crawford going with you?
What will you do?
And... where are things?
Can you quit?
Then why?
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Do you remember what you said?
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
I love you...
Blue is cold.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
To do what?
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Me, too. And very erotic...
At the store. You doin' some good?
Hello, hotshot!
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
He asked how you are.
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
