Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Me.
It's me.
Yes.
I'll see you later. All right?
No. Reba...?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
Reba...
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
I have work to do at the plant.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
Yes, are you okay...?!
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
It's a surprise.
Uh-huh.
You worked out well.
How did you come to Gateway?
Tonic will be fine.
Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
Ride with me.
I'll take you.
It'll do fine.
In eight days.
The activities of nocturnal animals.

I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
No!
No.
Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
You will tell the truth?

Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Are you a man?

Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Do you see?
Do you see?
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
In a little while I'll help you understand.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Do you feel privileged?
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
