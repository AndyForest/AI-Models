The Tooth...
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Francis...?
Who?
Who is it?
You'll come by?
Are you okay...?
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
Francis? Where are you?
I'm fine, Francis.
I'll get my purse.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
I'm fine.
Is that you. D?
That was nice of you to think of that.

I'll probably go back to it someday.

They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
In the kitchen.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
Let me stick this in the black hole.
When do you need it?
What's being photographed?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
