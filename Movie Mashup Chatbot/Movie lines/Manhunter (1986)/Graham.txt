Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
What have we missed?
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
In thirty-five minutes.
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Read it.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
It's happening again, Jack...
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
I'll cover the back.
How far away's the back-up?
What?
This is our boy...!
Parking permits...
It does, doesn't it?
Have him peel the top label back.
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Don't talk to me!!
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
That's why the boltcutter.
You wanna watch this or what?!
It's not over yet.
Something Lecktor said.
He's a very shy boy...
There has to be.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
How do I know?!
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
When I'm done.
That's narrow?
What's it narrow down to?
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
No.
I won't be here.
Get me a plane!
Get me a plane...
Tell me now.
What'd it say?
Who is it?
We will feel sick for a very long time.
Run it.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
Personal ads?
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
What is it?
Who did he ask for?
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
The mark? Yes.
To recover the mind set.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
Get him to Atlanta.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
As long as they're dead...
I am all right.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
No.
Somebody hurt him?
What else did you keep out of the papers?
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Can you read it to me?
Where did you get it?!
It's Will Graham...
I want to see Lecktor now.
No.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
I don't want to do that,
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
He's very strong physically.
He's misunderstood.
He's right-handed.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
Do you know something about that?
I don't understand.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
What about the dog?
I call him a monster.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
You got a deal...
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
What's the problem, Molly?
What's this Mama shit?
Come home with me.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Mama was probably asleep.
Hello.
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
No.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
No.
You haven't smoked in two years.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
I remember.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
Blue, then.
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
I have to see somebody.
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Tell me about yourself.
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Hey, baby! Where are you?
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Molly?
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
If I were?
What the hell can I do?
We have it good, don't we?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
And you said?
What did he want?
Tell her I called.
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
Yes. Is Molly there?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Go on to the house...
Go on to the house.
Thanks.
That's right.
Thanks for the lift.
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
My name's Will Graham. I...
Are you George Sherman?
Huh?
...yes.
...after a while.
No.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
We don't know that.
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
Yes.
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
Yeah...
Why does it feel good?
I don't believe in God.
Fight what?
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
What do you want?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
No.
I haven't decided yet.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I want your opinion.
Yes. I'd considered it.
That's interesting.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
You're insane.
You had disadvantages.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
I thought you would have some ideas.
You read about it, I'm sure.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
No.
Stuart is fine.
I got it. Thank you.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Let's walk the route.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Kevlar Second Chance.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Yes.
Pretty well.
