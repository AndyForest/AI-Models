'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
No.
God, no.
Yes.
Not me.
Please, no.

Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes...
No. I don't want to see you.
I don't know...
Yes.
I'm very scared.
Yes.
I don't want to know.
What am I doing here?

My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Was I in an accident?
