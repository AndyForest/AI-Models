Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Not today, Willow.
