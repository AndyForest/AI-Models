Get back here, Rool!
We gotta follow them.
Are you sure?
I'm not going in there.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Obviously.
The sorceress.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Hey, careful there!
Talk!  Say something!
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
You're the guardian, aren't you?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
