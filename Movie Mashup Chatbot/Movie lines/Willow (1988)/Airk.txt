Let's go.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
You're chasing a dream.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You managed alright.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
