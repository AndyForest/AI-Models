Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
As above, so below.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
I will!  But I need help!
He's no magician.
Patience, Willow.
Time is running out.
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Just do it!
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
More!  More!
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
Tir Asleen.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Now use it.
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
Shhhhh!
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Me!
The art of transformation!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
What's the magician's weapon?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
Burn it to a fine ash.
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
Then I will teach you.
You must learn magic.
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
Kill him!
Kill him!
What do you want!
Who are you!  Who are you!
