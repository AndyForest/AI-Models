Thank you, friend.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Just get me some horses.
Then come with us.
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Is this what's left of your army?
You left me to die, friend.
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Sorsha.
Because it's true.
Say what?
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Why not?
I can't.
I can't.
No.  I mean yes.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Who is that girl, anyway?
Then you get us out of here.
He turned that monster into stone!
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
I don't know, Willow.
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Watch it!
She's a bird, Willow.
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
Want me to carry Elora?
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
She's in love.
Well what did she say?
Willow!
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
Did she ask about me?
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
I won't.
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I did?
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
I thought you had her!
Because she's sick.
Time to leave.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Where the hell did you come from?
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Of course!  I promise!
Absolutely!
I will.
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
You hear trouble.
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
Smells like a battle.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
You a woodcutter?
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Why.
Miserable Pecks.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
