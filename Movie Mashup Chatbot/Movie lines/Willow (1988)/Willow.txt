They look like acorns.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
What is Tir Asleen?
Me?
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
Yes...?
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
Ahhh!
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
You?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
She said lots of thing.s
Who?
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
I'll help you...!
You?
Madmartigan, I need your help.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
Elora Danan!
Where's the baby??
Because she's sick.
Time to change her diaper.
Nursemaid?!
Hey!  Give me that baby!
You!!
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Fresh goat's milk.
You gotta promise to feed her.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
I hate this.
Friend of yours?
What is it?
What's that?  I hear something!
Are you a warrior?
You all right?
Farmer.
I don't know.
Are you okay?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
I have to give this baby to some- body.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Good.  How long will it take?
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Absolutely not.
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
Courage, Willow.
Surrender!!
She's too powerful, Raziel
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Why?
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
How??
There's nobody here.
I just wanted to test it first.
His will.
What'd you bit me for!!
Ouch!!
Oooh, this smells terrible.
But what am I gonna transform??
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
The limitless power of...
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
How am I gonna do that?
I'm all finished.  Now what?
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
What do I need for that?
That's all I ever wanted!
No.
No!
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
Here.  Hold her.
She's hungry.
I don't know much about him.
Madmartigan.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
She needs to be changed.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
How are we going to get out there?
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
This is not going well.
Why not?
Ohhh, I hate this.
I'm getting her out of there!
Who??
Queen Cherlindrea?
