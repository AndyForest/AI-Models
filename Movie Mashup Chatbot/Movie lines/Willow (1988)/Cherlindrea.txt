Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
You are very important, Willow.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
Willow Ufgood.
