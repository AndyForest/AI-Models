He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
Then why ain't he dead?
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
Good lad.
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hackers.
Who's got the contract?
What about the other one?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
They workin' for anybody?
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
Which one?
I'm busy, Floyd.
You're more gutless than I thought.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
The name is Lonnegan.
I guess I left it in my room.
See and raise 1,000.
Raise 500.
Pass.
See and raise five.
Raise 500.
Lonnegan.
I don't know, figure something out.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
What happened to your face?
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
Let me talk to him.
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
You got the 400 grand yet?
I'm in.
You got a system, Carver?
Why don't ya then.
You're a lucky man, all right.
You really picked a winner, kid.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
Get on with it then.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
You're dreamin', kid.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
All right, then.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
Then why the rat?
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
What do you mean?
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
You weren't hired to miss him.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
