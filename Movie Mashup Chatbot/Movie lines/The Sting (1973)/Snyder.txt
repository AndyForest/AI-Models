What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Which way are the rooms?
All right if I look around your lobby?
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
You the owner here?
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
He'll never do it.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
What is this?  I got work to do.
