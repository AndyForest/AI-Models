At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
Billie.  You ready?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
You in?
I'm not sure I know it.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
