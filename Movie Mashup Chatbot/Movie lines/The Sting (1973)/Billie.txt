I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall.
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
That's right.
Yeh, go ahead.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
He'll probably fall down.
What's the line on Visitation?
