Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
You got a bag or somethin?
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
