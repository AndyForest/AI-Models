Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
Twist, you know this guy?
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
