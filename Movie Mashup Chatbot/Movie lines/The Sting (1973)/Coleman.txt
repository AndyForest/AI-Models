That's the way I want it.
I'm out, Johnny.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
I think it's the best...
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
How much did ya lose?
You're late.  Where you been?
