Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?
Here.
No.
What do we do?
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'.
Naw, it's okay.
No, no cops!
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
