Don't worry about it, pal.
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
Shove off, Duff.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Okay, Tootsie.
All right, when?
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
