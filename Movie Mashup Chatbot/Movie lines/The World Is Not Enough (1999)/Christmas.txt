So isn�t it time you unwrapped your present?
We can�t.
But what if...
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Do you know what you�re doing?
He�s going to insert the plutonium.
Is there another way?
Zukovsky...
The King pipeline.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He�s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub�s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
What is it?
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Who�s she?
What the hell are you talking about?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
It�s a bomb alright. We�re still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
The plutonium is missing.  They�ve taken the core!
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
They won�t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
So who are you?
He is an impostor.  There�s no Davidov at Miratom.
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren�t around, they�d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
What happened to Len Tashka?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I�ve heard them all.
You new?
What class sub does your nephew run?
What is this place?
Bond!
What?
