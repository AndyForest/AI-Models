Oh James.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I�m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather�s name, the glory of my people.
It is my oil!  Mine and my family�s!
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
Since I was a child, I�ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn�t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Soon she�ll be everywhere.
I could have given you the world.
You do what you have to do, but I�ve called in M.  She�s en route from London even now.
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn�t have to sleep with you to find that out.
I don�t know what you�re talking about!
Are you saying...Renard is the man who�s trying to kill me?
...what?
What are you talking about?
What�s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I�ve never told anyone that.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Really?
You had your chance, James. Now I�m looking for a bigger thrill.
Someone wants to kill me, I�d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
Vodka martini.
I don�t want to be safe!
Then take me with you.
James...
What is it?
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I�m a coward.
I know.
No!  It will cave in!
I can�t stay here.
Oh my God...we�re buried alive...
You don�t take no for an answer, do you?
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
That�s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That�s why you�re here, isn�t it? You think I can�t do it. You think I�m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
If you�ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I don�t need a third...
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
It�s my father�s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He�s decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Partially, yes.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don�t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I�m not sure he knew that.
I haven�t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
I met you at my father�s funeral.
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they�re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn�t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Please.
Could...could you come?
Everything�s under control up here.  Are you ready?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
What do you think?
Of course...
How would you know?
Warm.
