I love Christmas in Turkey.
We�ve got to get out.
Count to twenty.  I�ll be there.
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we�ll sink.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
Like riding a bike.
He�s sealed himself in.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
If I don�t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden�s Tower, M is dead.
Elektra would control it all.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Made to look just like an accident.
Nuclear.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M�s life is part of the bet.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Makes her look even more innocent.
Elektra King.
It�s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
I did kill us. She thinks we�re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Then it�s no longer a bomb?
Alright then, brunch.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
With this?
Bond --
Shame you had to spot I wasn�t the real thing.
Here�s your imposter. He�s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They�re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they�re flying it wherever he tells them.
Couldn�t make it. Splitting headache.
Don�t know any doctor jokes.
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
I could come for a second opinion?
Perhaps after this ... test?
It�s just a scratch.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
They�re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can�t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
The report King bought. It�s a manual. Renard�s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
The worm on the hook again.
He�s not through yet. Renard doesn�t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there�s more coming in. He�s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
�That which does not kill me makes me stronger.�
He survived?
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Renard.
Who?
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
I was the one who brought that money in...
I took the initiative.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
It�s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
She�s not a girl anymore.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Old friend?
Construction�s not exactly my line.
The name?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Who did you get it from?
Which is neutral, no doubt.
Haven�t you heard the news?  So is she.
She�ll get over it.
Consider me ungrateful.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Who is it?
Revenge isn�t so hard to fathom. What�s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Indeed.
I�m sorry.
You knew him well?
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
Yes.
One... last... screw?
Elektra, it�s not too late.  Eight million people needn�t die.
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Was this all about the oil?
So you killed your father.
You turned Renard.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Where�s M?
Not interested.
I�m coming with you.
He used your exact words.
I think you do.
You can drop the act, it�s over.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
A little. Does it matter? After all, what�s the point of living if you can�t feel alive?  Isn�t that right, Elektra? Isn�t that your motto?
How did you survive?
Shush.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
I understand it�s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
If this little show is for my benefit, I�ll take you home right now.
What the hell are you doing here?
Two. Shaken not stirred.
I have to go to work.
No. You�ll be safe here.
I have to go.
...you should rest.
I think you�re one of the bravest people I�ve ever met.
I can�t stay.
It�s the only way out...
You�re not going to.
We�re alright.
No.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King�s daughter.
The killer doesn�t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn�t want to see you take over...
It�s not the pin your father wore. It�s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
Does this look familiar to you?
How long has he been with you?
Who is he?
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Funerals aren�t exactly memorable.
Yes.
How appropriate.
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
Where?
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Where�s the sub going?!
And the payoff on the tables?
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
Now...where were we?
You are out of your league.  She�s working with Renard.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn�t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
What�s your business with Elektra King?
She�s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat�s nest.
You, of course. I need some information.
Valentin Zukovsky.
