The inside man?
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn�t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
The doctor who saved him couldn�t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he�s a dead man.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I�d do the same again.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra�s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
It�s a message.  He wants us to know he�s back.
I�m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
You haven�t been given an assignment in this case.
Who told you to look at Elektra�s files?
And now it�s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
I�ve scheduled a medical for you.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I�ve known that girl all her life. I�m not sure she knows what she�s walking into.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He�s a man of great integrity.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Someone will come.
Your father...
Perhaps this isn�t the time...
I�ll send someone out.
Any word from him?
Where it can do the most damage.
The parcel�s in the post.
Marvellous.
Do we have the range of Renard�s plane?
We�ve been pawns in someone�s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
