I didn't want to be going around your back.
How 'bout you?
Yeah.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
Oh.
They got telephones.
The Republicans?
Uh-huh.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
You're out early.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
Just doing my job.
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
