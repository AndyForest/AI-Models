You told me one time it was true love.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--

You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Steve called for you.
