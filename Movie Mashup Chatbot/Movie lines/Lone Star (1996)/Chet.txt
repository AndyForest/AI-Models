My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
So I'm part-Indian?
So how come you got into all this?
He's still pissed off about it.
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
That guy who got shot--
You know who I am?
But they were Indians themselves.
They fought against the Indians?
So they stayed in Florida?
The Trail of Tears.
He a Black man or an Indian?
No sir.
Cool.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Are we going to ever see your father?
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
You wouldn't?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
I have a B average.
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
Dad--?
Dad--
