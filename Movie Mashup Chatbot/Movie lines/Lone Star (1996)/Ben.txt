What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
Just wondering.
A .45--
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Yeah.
That badge--
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
I hear they're closing that post down.
How's business?
Sam the Man.
