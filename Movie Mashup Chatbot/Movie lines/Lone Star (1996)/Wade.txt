You little pissant--
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Bandidos, Injuns--
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
What's in the back?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
And people better clear out of here! Now!
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
How come you don't took familiar?
Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that.
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
Why you think that was?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
