Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
Yes, Amy.
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
You mustn't be afraid.
Don't cry, Amy.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong ï¿½ warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
I shall wear it in my hair!
Oh, how beautiful!
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Your children?
Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
Of course,
That's right!
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
But you must!
Can't you get it, darling?
Whenever you want.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
For as long as you'll let me.
I can not tell you.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
I'm your friend.
You called me by my name.
