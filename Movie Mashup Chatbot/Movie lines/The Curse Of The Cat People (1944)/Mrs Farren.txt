I can't do it! I can't do it!
Yes, yes -
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.

A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.

Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Then I'll tell you a story � a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE>                                AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
