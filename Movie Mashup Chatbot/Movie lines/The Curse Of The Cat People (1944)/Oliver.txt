We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
I suppose so.
Where did you get it?
I haven't had my breakfast.
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
What?
What is it, Alice?
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
I'm never unfair.
Well, it seemed to me --
Amy's been lying again.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Something's haywire,
I think I should.  3000W?
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
Where is everybody?
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
I know that.
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
Yes, darling.
But there's no one here, darling.
I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
Yes, Amy?
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
Voices from an old dark house!
Let me be the judge of that.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories ï¿½ I'm sick of this sort of thing.
And who did the voice belong to?
Now Amy
Why didn't you run after them?
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
Can't you tell me later?
What do you want. Amy?
But this is different.  Go on blow,
Certain wishes do.
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
Amy, not that old tree!
Where did you mail them?
Did you mail then?
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
I like to see her happy.
And Amy mailed them?
Go on -- out with you.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
