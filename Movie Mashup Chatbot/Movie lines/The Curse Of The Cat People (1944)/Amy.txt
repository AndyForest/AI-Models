But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
All right, mommy.
Irena.
What's her name?
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
But it's already come true.
I got my wish anyway.
Are they nice?
Do you know the people?
On the back street � a green house
At the old house with the voice.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
Did your wishes ever come true?
Did you ever make a wish?
Mommy --
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself � tell the truth --
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
I got lots of presents.
I live right here.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
Daddy?
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
But...
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
She's there whenever I call her!
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
Because she is my friend.
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
Daddy!
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Just you wait!
These are all from me.
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
No, I didn't.
Daddy, it's true.
It was just a voice.
It's true.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
They ran away.
It was on account of the birthday party.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
But wishes don't come true.
I didn't forget.
Yes, daddy.
I'll show you.
Yes, I did.
Yes, daddy.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
No.
I don't know yet.
But why?
You?
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
But she's dead!
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
It's you...Irena...my friend!
I want to touch it.
May I pet the deer?
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It stands so still.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, please!
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
My dolls. We can pretend.
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
But we don't have any sea weed.
That one's an elm.
This is more fun than just pretend.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
A princess?
The numbers simply don't mean anything
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
You'll always play with me?
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
I shall want you for always.
Will you be friend for always?
But where is that?
But where do you come from?
I've wanted a friend.
Irena. But who are you?
Who are you?
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
But it was alive � it was fast and strong!
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
But what happened to the little deer?
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
But she's such a nice lady.
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
That means I can go alone?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Will you come soon?
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
I wasn't singing to myself.
I'm trying to.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
It's a pretty ring.
A lady threw it to me.
Look at my ring.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
Hurry!
Hurry, hurry.
Hide me? Why?
And does he kill people?
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
What?
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
Why hasn't he got a head?
Mommy read it to ne.
I like stories.
No, thank you.
Who is she?
But I only came to give back the ring.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
