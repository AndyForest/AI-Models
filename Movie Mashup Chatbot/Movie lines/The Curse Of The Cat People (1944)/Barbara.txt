Good night, mother, good night.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
Mother! You called me by name!
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
Look at me.
