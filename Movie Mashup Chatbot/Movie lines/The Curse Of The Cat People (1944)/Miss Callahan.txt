Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
What do you mean?
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?

Hello, Amy.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.

But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
