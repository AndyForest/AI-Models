How?
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year � St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
I love the smell of pine.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday � about Oliver's first marriage � and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy � although he'll never realize it.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
Oh, hello.
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
Oh, thank you, darling.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
Irena.
She was very pretty.
Where'd you get this, darling?
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Well � the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
The Farren house
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
But where did you get it, Amy?
Where did you get this ring?
Sometimes.
Oh, lots of times.
Yes, darling.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
What song, dear?
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
What are saying, darling?
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
You get your wish!
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
What's funny?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
Well, you know where it is.
It's your play.
Ollie.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
You're shouting at me.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
Did you hear the child out?
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
What do you mean?
That's right.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
Times have changed.
Yes, darling,
It's early yet.
I forgot I had it on.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today � let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
You do that, Edward.
But I told her to go with you.
That's the Farren house.
I thought you were with Amy.
