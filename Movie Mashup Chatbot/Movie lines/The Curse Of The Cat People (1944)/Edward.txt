She said something about that, Mrs. Reed � but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
It got hit.
Because it can't. It's dead.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
Soon as I finish.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
Let me take another look at that ring.
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
That's the clever way to do it.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
What is it, ma'am?
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
Come away, Amy.
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
Now, I don't know Amy --
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
So do I, Mr. Reed.
Amy looks happy � seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
She pleaded so to do it
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
