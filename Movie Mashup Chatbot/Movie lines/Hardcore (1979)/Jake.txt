No. I don't think so.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
No, just not the type.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
What are you doing?
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
But is she, has...
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
I'm getting angry.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
What do you mean?
You want a tip?
What do you mean?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
What?
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
No, I don't.
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
Well, I want to...
You'll be fine.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
I just want to ask some questions.
Yeah.
No.
Okay.
Just one.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
That's all you got, three girls?
What girls you got here?
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah.
Yeah. How did you know?
If you say so.
Are you sure it's all right?
Yeah.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
What's that shade of blue called?
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Is this all the display space we can get?
Where is he, Niki?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
Where is he?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Granville?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Why do you say that?
What makes you so sure?
But what?
Grand Rapids? Of course.
They are the same.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
Where does he live.
Why can't I meet him now?
It's not quite the same thing.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
More or less.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
I can stop if you want.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Is Kristen safe?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
They were here?
What's T-J?
I care about my daughter.
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
Not very.
But it's all you do.
No.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
Is that the way it was with you?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Say what?
You know what I'm talking about.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
She's dead.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
A friend.
No.
Ulcers.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
No.
I am.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Half now, half later.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Three hundred?
Something like that. How much do you make?
How much do you make a week, Niki?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Where's he?
Where is she?
Do you know where she would be?
Do you know where she lives?
You know her?
Um-hm. Live sound.
Yeah.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
No.
Are you Niki?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
The other girl is the star?
Are you the star of this picture?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Just leave me alone.
Does she know anything about this?
It's just a name.
I just heard. Who is he?
Who is Ratan?
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Yeah, sure.
Do the police want to arrest me?
What are you doing here?
Get out!
Get out.
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Do you think she's safe?
But the police...
What's it called?
What do you mean?
Who made it?
Where did you get that film?
Where is she?
Hmm.
They are?
No.
That's like a stag film.
No.
What do you mean?
Where is she?
What have you found out?
I'll be there.
I've got a meeting...
In G.R.? Why?
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
Mast?
Hello?
And better?
That's right.
Who's paying you?
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
...What do you have to offer?
So then, Mr. Mast...
Well, what do they know?
Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
Wes, do me a favor.
How did you find me?
Pretty good.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Where!
Where does he hang out?
Where is she? Where is the girl?
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
That's not true, Mr...?
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Let's go.
Ratan!
Where's Ratan?
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
Good.
Okay.
Well...
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Rucker.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
I want to meet Ratan.
No.
Yeah.
That's all right.
No.
But I...
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
It's a short film.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
What?
Sounds all right.
Jake.
I thought you were a businessman.
It's an investment.
Not exactly...
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
What do you think of that? Or this?
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
