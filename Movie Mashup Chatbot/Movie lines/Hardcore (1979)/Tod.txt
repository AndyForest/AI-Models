Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Who?
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
Take it or leave it.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Who told you about this?
You're talking about real excitement?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
What you got in mind?
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
