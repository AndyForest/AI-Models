Wait?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
That's cool.
Now, what do you want?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Are you going to stiff me?
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Pull out your cock.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
You're still dressed?
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Do you want to take a session?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
