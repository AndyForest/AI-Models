Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Overpowering?
Sam?
Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
