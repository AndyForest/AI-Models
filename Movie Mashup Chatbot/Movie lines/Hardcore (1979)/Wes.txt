What will I tell the others? They care about you.
What plan?
What is going on?
What?
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
Jake?
You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
How's your business, Jake?
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
Is Marsha there?
What happened?
What is it, Jake?
Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
To anybody.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I'm worried about Jake.
Oh.
