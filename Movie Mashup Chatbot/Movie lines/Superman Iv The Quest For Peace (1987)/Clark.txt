Lacy. . . I . . .
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Like me?
I'm not so sure you do.
I'm sorry to see you go.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Oh . . . my . . .
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
If you say so. Here goes.
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Don't worry, I've got you.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
I've never been in a place like this before.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
They make my eyes itch.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
I really don't think . . .
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
Superman? Has something happened to him?
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
Politely?
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
