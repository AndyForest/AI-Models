Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
Clark. . . !
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
. . . Let me get my purse.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
What about here?
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
You're late. Very late.
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Stuff it.
Daddy . . . ?
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
What's that?
What's he going to say?
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
I think there's an angle.
Superman gets mail here?
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
I think he's kind of cute.
Is he for real?
