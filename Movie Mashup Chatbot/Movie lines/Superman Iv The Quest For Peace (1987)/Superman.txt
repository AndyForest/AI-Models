Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Go on . . .
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
I'm sorry.
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
I'll deal with you later.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
I'm not going anywhere.
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
