Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
This wasn't in the plan.
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
He's . . . cold. . .
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
What was that about?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
There!
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
Get the box, nephew.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
I made you, and I can destroy you.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
But . . . how could you beat him?
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
