Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
And what do we get out of it?
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
But Superman isn't an average man.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
