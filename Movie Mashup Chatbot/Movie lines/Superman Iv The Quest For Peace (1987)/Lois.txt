It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Clark . . . wait!
No Paris?
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
It always is with Clark.
Where's Clark?
Our other dinner guest.
Something . . . wonderful.
But he's never there.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Who?
An angle?
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
. . . And  very naï¿½ve!
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
