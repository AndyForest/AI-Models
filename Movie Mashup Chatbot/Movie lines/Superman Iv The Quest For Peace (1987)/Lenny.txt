Lucky I brought my drums.
You think he'll find us.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
We'll all fry.
Boy, are you gonna get it.
What?
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
You're just an experiment, freako!
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Whoa. . .
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
But why the hair?
A toupee that flies?
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
