Good idea.
This is bullshit - we don�t even know what Max looks like.
I don�t know.  It didn�t say on the tickets.
He�s putting on a show, Barnes.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
And if we don�t find him - we�ll search the whole train again.
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Okay!
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
S.O.P..
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybody�s got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Certainly Ethan.
It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
Kittridge.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
I don't quite follow you.
What?
Yes.  I see your point.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
One hour.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Don�t disappoint me.
Location green.  One hour.  I�ll be there myself.
Don�t <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Are you damaged?
Who�s dead?
Go ahead.
This is Kittridge.
