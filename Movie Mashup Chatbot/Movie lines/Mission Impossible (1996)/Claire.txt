Yes.
Don�t Jim.
All ten million.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
You knew about Jim?
Krieger.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Always.
It�s all right, Ethan..you�ll bring me back...won�t you...
This stuff is so sticky.
Ethan?
Ethan�s right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Two cars.  Where are you?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
Okay...
What happened?
What are you going to do?
Bastard!
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
What about you?
You didn't have to.........
You don't think we're going to make it.
Sure...
What kind of help?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Max made a deal with you?
The message is for Job.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
What are you going to do?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Who is they, who is they?
Who is "they?"
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
What?
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
What happened to Jim?
What happened to Jim?
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Roger that.
Oh yeah?
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Sleeping's better.
I'm walking.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Did we get it?
