I always have, Claire..
Claire.
Claire...Hey...
Of course - I�m sorry to hear you say that Claire.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Is this the only way?
I sent the message to Max.  We�re on for tomorrow.
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Kittridge...
We did what we had to do.
What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
I just need you to be safe.
I didn't say that.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
May I come in?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
You're sure about this?
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
I'm going to answer it.
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Where were you?
Take off your God damn coat!
Take off your coat.
There was nobody on the bridge.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
You were in the car!
Don't move.
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
We got it.  On your feet.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
The arms dealer.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Why was there another team?
Who else is left?
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Yeah.  I follow you.
Yeah.
No sir.
You�re in Prague?
Yes.
I don�t think so.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
They knew we were coming.  Golitsyn�s dead too.  The disk is gone.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- don�t know
They�re dead.
Go secure.
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
About what?
I'll get you close.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
Profitable.
Information.
What about Job?
It doesn�t, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
I wouldn't dream of it.
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
What was your deal with Job?
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Like Job?
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
That depends.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Let's move!
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
What sector's the air conditioning?
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
My contact is extremely shy.
We're not outta here yet.
Time up.
Zero body count.
In Langley.
IMF mainframe.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Stairway, you�re wrapped, go to transport.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
Jack.  Jack.
Give me the God damn gum.
Always.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Jack.
No, we�re going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, I�m coming to you.
Jim we can�t.
Jim.  Jim.  He�s in the open.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Right, right.  Good.
Higher.  Higher.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
I'm willing to take the chance.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
Then what am I doing here?
I thought I was going to see Max.
Why?
Jim, it�s over.
You�re wrong about one thing.  I�m not the only one who�s seen you alive.
Aren�t you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
I knew about Jim.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
And get a doctor.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  I�ll call you from Paris.
You�re probably right.
Jim...?
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. I�ll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
What he didn�t get in Prague.  The NOC list.
We don�t have to, Jim.  He�ll come after us.
How did Kittridge do it?..
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
I remember..
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
- and picked us up in the States -
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsyn�s on the move.
Can you lose him?
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
Sure.  If the main character does.
He won't be back in a hurry?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
You're going to use Walter?
How was Chicago?
Why not?
I guess.
What problem?
Tell you what?
Oh?  What's the problem?
I thought I'd take some now.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
