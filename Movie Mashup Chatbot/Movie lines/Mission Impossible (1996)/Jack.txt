Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Give me a break, Pops.
I didn't touch it.
Just don't chew it.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Claire.
And a lonely ass.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
That's what we do isn't it?
Why don't you take a look?
What's going on?
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
