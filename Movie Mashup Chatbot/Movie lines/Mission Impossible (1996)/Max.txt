I wouldn�t worry about him.  Once you�ve got the money -- he�ll find you.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesn�t prelude a meeting in private.
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Very good.
Mm - Hmmm...
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Why should I?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Why, may I ask?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
It's quite out of the question.
On what?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Phew!  We�ve got five minutes...
Run it through from the top.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Try it again.
What�s the problem.
This wasn�t what we discussed.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
