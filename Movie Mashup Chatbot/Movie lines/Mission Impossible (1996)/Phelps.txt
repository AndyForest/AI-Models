Now we don�t have to eliminate him?  You like that, don�t you Claire?  Don�t you?
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
Satisfied?
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, you�ve asked the question and you are the answer.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  This�ll have to be quicker than I�d like. Certainly quicker than you�d like.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Ethan - I�ve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Don�t flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
Keep counting Claire.
But, he didn�t know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbour�s wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the world�s lovers, he�s tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
They stamped it, didn�t they?  Those damn Gideons.
Good luck.
You got it.
I usually am.
- no.  She can�t know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  There�s too much at stake, Ethan.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking I�m dead and gone.  God knows what she�s had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
What�s going to make him do that?
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize it�s over, you�re an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, you�ve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, we�ll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Yeah.
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
They�re covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
Where are you?
Abort.  That�s an order.
No.  Abort.
I�ve got a shadow.
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
He's our guy.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
