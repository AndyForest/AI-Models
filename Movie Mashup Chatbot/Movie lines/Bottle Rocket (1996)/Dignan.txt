Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
No. I'm not.
I think I may have found a way out of here.
He stole a tractor.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Does it float?
Where?
How big is it?
You're living on a sailboat?
What do you mean?
Why?
You think Applejack knew?
The grandfather clock?
What'd he get?
You got to be kidding me.
He did?
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
Can't remember shit. CRS.
I don't think so.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
I'll get him.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
Come on, Kumar.
Let's go. Come on.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
Where's Kumar?
Who tripped the alarm?
Help me move him.
Nobody move!
Applejack! What's happening?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
What's happening? What's going on?
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Good. It's supposed to be.
Any activity?
Take your second position.
Hang on a second.
Roger.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Yes. I do.
As a person?
He was all right.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
I don't think you will.
Did that hurt?
Next week we'll be drinking piï¿½a coladas.
It's like we've finally arrived.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
OK. Mark that down.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
I'm sorry, Bob.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Get out of the way.
Bob!
What do you think?
Let me feel that.
Right now.
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
I want you to look at this.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Ah. Couple days ago.
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
That's what she is!
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
How much?
Where's the rest?
Sixteen dollars.
That's not correct.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Don't panic, Anthony.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
You don't know how to hotwire.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
She doesn't need to know.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I have an idea for that.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
Would of been nice.
Can you hand me those french fries.
OK.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
He told you and you let him do it.
Where was I?
When'd he tell you?
We said 48 hours.
He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Right here.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Yes... It's true.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
See, now we've got a plan.
Obviously. That's a given.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
He needs to hire an attorney.
No kidding.
Which one was that?
They don't?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
What the fuck is going on here?
May I have a word with you, please?
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Hi.
No. We didn't.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
True.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
You owe me fifty bucks.
On your marks...  Get set go.
I'll say it.
You were spoiled rotten.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
What about them?
Yes, they are.
See if mine are in there.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
Well, then cut it in half.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Why not?
Can I get that credit card from you?
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
What's wrong with him?
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
Yeah.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
We got it. We got it.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
We know there's another stocker.
Where's the other stocker?
You're right. You're right.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Loop around real fast.
Yeah.
Hang on a second.
That's not bad.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Yeah, I heard that.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
I'm lookout.
Did you see that?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
What do you think the cops have?
She's an attractive older woman.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
Would they do that?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
This is he?
What does Starsky say?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
Why?
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
OK. That's wrong.
Making Hutch David Soul?
What color hair does he have?
Bob! Get back in position!
True.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Wait. Did he see us?
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
Yeah.
That's Anthony.
Wait a second.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Now!
Here we go.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Run. Run. Let's go.
Where's Applejack?
Take him to the car, Bob.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Is he breathing?
Let's go!
What's wrong with Applejack?
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Yeah?
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Bob.
Look. We want you on the job.
I'm sorry, Bob.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
Come on!
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Bob, you're lying!
You said 48 hours!
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Right. It was extremely stupid.
Yeah. It is.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Not bad.
Anthony. Bad news.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
Just get in the car, Bob.
Yes, I do.
I know it's not.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
I can't do that, Bob.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
Not in that car you're not.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
This could be a trap.
Bob, that makes no sense.
What do you mean get back?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
How long has he been in there?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
That could be anybody's.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
What are you talking about?
You can go first, Bob.
Bob. Are you coming?
What the fuck possessed you?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
I don't know.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
So it's my fault?
Way to go, Bob!
Bob, I've got nightmares.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
Bob, will you please listen?
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
No. I was calm.
Don't count it.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
God DAMMIT.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
Bob.
That's your domain.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
I think we might of scared her.
Where'd she go?
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
The guy is fucking insane.
What did I say?
What was that all about?
You're paranoid, Bob.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
OK, Bob.
You stole a Trans-Am.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Let's cut the bullshit.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
So who's going to know?
I thought your parents were in Italy.
Not even for emergencies?
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Did you hear that?
Hand to hand combat?
And what does that cover?
How long do you have to go?
Well, I think --
Yes.
We're just going over a few things.
Is he good?
Oh, yeah.
The grammar?
What do you mean grammar?
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
What can we do?
What's the story?
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
Who? Applejack?
You got that?
Where is he? Where is Rob?
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Well, I left some money in there.
Where's that guy going?
It's locked.
Mr. Henry?
Right.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Just pool.
What?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
I don't know.
Got a little lucky.
Sure.
No, my friend knows her.
No. I just have short hair.
