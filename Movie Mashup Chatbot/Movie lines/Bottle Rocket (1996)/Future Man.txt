Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I might have mentioned it.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
How's that 700 bucks coming?
Nice to meet you.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
What?
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
