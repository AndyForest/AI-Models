Scale the --
Dignan, I --
What?
Dignan, I --
How?
You're kidding.
What's he in for?
So how is it in there?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Behind Bob's house.
Oh, I'd say about --
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Nothing.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
We're not sure.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
Pretty much everything.
I'm not kidding.
Yeah.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Like amnesia.
Dignan, it's too late.
There's not enough time.
What are you talking about?
What?
Come on.
You're kidding.
Wait for Kumar.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Careful. Check his pulse.
Get against the wall!
Freeze!
It's going back down.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
I don't know.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
OK. Roger.
Uh-huh?
We all set?
You're all clear.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
So do I.
Yeah. As a girl.
Do you like Inez?
He was a nice guy.
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
I did.
Eleven fifteen.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Shit, Dignan.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
He doesn't want to fight.
Dignan. Take it easy.
He seems pretty good.
You could give somebody a concussion.
What time did he say to be here?
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
Who's Mr. Henry?
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
What is it?
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Sure.
Who's in the car?
When'd you get back?
Shut up!
I know that. But --
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
She needed it.
$383.
I had to give some to Inez.
I know.
We've got sixteen dollars.
Our money situation is not good.
I'm not. But there's --
I think we better go home.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
Shh.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
I don't think we can do that.
What?
We need a car.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I wish I'd been there.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Why don't you come with us.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
If you say so.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
You were asleep.
This morning.
That's a long time to be in jail.
He went back for his brother.
Maybe he just went to the store.
Where was it parked?
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
This was in fourth grade.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Bob?
As long as he gets out OK.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
She's from Cuba.
On the left.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
What. What's the matter?
Sure.
Inez, this is --
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
It's not a plan. It's just --
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
Bob?
OK. Go ahead.
I'll just say it.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Look at the treads on those.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
I keep it for emergencies.
I don't want to use it.
Because my mom gets the bill.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Don't even say it, man.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
What do you think?
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Like he meant it.
What about what that guy said?
Holy shit.
Is that the manager?
There's another stocker, right?
Where's the manager?
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Dignan! Stop!
Dignan, calm down.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Nothing. Go ahead.
You think we're going to be chased?
Just turn right here.
Is it back in?
But he didn't say anything.
Eight dollars.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
It had an alarm.
That sets it off.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
Yeah, I saw it.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
How was I ridiculing you?
Where are you going?
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
She's really kind of hot.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
No. This is he.
He says. This is he.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
Dignan, it's --
Right. The blond guy.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Why'd you want to help us?
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Yeah.
This is good.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
No. Bob did.
Death.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
I don't want to die.
Me?
That sounds like Dignan.
How'd he do?
Did Dignan take the test?
It feels good.
That was a test?
What do you mean?
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
So do I.
You mean a safecracker?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
You mean like techniques?
Grammar.
Thanks.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Thanks.
Nice to meet you.
Temporarily.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
Who's got the car keys?
Jesus, Bob.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
What are you doing?
Sure.
Nothing. I was just asking.
You OK, Bob?
Give him a second.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Let's not even talk about it.
Was Future Man adopted?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Were you adopted, Bob?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
No, I don't mind.
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Why not?
Bob, where you going?
Is that OK?
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
How long are they going to hold him?
He looked too shaken-up.
OK, Dad.
Nobody does.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Where you going?
I hope not.
There's a million places to hide around here.
What was that?
See you, Bob.
Yeah. He said that.
Let them fight.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Could you grow cinnamon?
Hector woudn't do anything.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Did you ever steal a car before?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Future Man.
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
What?  What?
God, yes. Like silk.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
Were you born in Mexico?
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
How do you say nineteen?
The front stairs.
What do you mean?
Abdul-Shabazz?
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
