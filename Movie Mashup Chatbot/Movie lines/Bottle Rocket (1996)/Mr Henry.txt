Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Absolutely.
We're renegades from despair.
It's an esoteric journey.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
Anthony, I'm petrified.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Exactly. Woah.
Are you afraid?
No, that door over there.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
Yes, he did.
How does that feel?
Take a deep breath.
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Hold it.
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
That's a sharp jacket.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
Why?
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Join the party, fellas.
He's damn good.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
Is he in?
This is no good.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
The world needs dreamers, son.
Good to know you, John.
