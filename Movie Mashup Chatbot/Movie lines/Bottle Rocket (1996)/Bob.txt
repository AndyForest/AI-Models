It's in the driveway.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Yeah.
I didn't do anything.
No.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
It was stupid.
Jesus Christ! No.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Why do you say that?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Sixty days?
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
You think I'm improving?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
I'm not playing any more golf.
What?
Anthony, I --
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
You think he got my license plates?
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Move.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
See you.
Are you serious?
Let them fight.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Who?
The one and only Little Richard.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
Are you a fag?
Wait a second --
Hold on --
Do they let you --
Do you have your own cell?
Do you have your own room?
What's that?
Applejack drove.
He's stuck between two floors.
The elevator broke.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
I think so.
He's having a heart attack or something.
I couldn't hear anything.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Everything OK?
Scarecrow?
I know it, man. Hang on.
That's OK.
That's OK.
I didn't have any choice.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
Bullshit.
I never agreed to that.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Dignan.
Let's go.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
What's his name?
What is it?
You don't even know his name.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Watch me.
I'm going back.
Come on, Dignan.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
We'll have to see when we get back.
I don't know.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
They said he's a drug dealer.
The weed.
My brother's in jail.
See you in a little while.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
It's registered in my mother's name.
Is he chasing us?
He wouldn't move.
There were more than that.
I told you they were there.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I don't want to talk about it.
You really think he'll remember you?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
How much is there?
Did we get it?
This is natural.
What happened?
What are you doing?
That's too bad.
His name was Swifty?
He electrocuted someone?
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
I paid for it.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
OK.
That's my responsibility.
I'm going to take a look at this.
Let's just go.
Maybe she turned.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I warned you, Dignan.
I told you he's crazy.
I can't believe you said that.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
Good question.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
I'll just drive my car.
It's true, Dignan.
Yes. I did.
Can you use a coaster.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
That never would of --
My brother.
They are.
No.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Well, what do you think?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
I'm working on it.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
He said what?
I'm trying.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
