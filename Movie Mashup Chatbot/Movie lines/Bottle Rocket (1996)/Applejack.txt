Where were you?
Where'd they come from?
Feel this.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
I hear you're a good thief.
You're Anthony?
What?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
What's he doing here?
That's your friend Anthony?
Is that him?
Is that Buckethead?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
