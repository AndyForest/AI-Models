Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
I can undress myself, thank you.
Pray you, undo this button.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Oh Clayton.
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
What was that?
There are straps in back.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
Don't move.
You are much too human.
No.  It won't do.
So it is going to happen after all.
Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
I don't remember that one.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
Not at all.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
I'm very sorry.
What happened?
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
A very lucky thing indeed.
The Great War?
I see.
But you said --
Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
That only leaves the rest.
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
It's not like her.
Catch my death.
We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
Let's get out of this funk hole
Run for what?
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Are you enjoying yourself?
David produced her last picture.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
What did I tell you?  Listen.
Nothing would please me more.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
I want -- I want...
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
I was an officer.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
Everybody has stories to tell.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
Oh no.  I never swim.
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Better work.
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
Ah.  A philosopher.
Very well put.
Why not?
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons.  Is that so much to ask?  Just two little buttons.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
But we have to match the other sketch.
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
So we understand each other?
Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
What way might that be?
I never thought you were.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
Does that surprise you?
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
No.  At least not in the legal sense.
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
All righty.  I understand.
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Did you kill anyone?
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Did anyone laugh?
Did you now?
Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  Lunch should be ready.  Shall we?
Is this David's doing?
Do you mind?
I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
You don't say?  Which picture?
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
Yes.  You were a Marine.
You went to university?
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
What?  Oh yes.
Splendid.
Or would you prefer a beer?
The honest sweat of one's brow.  I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
And your name is --?
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Good morning.
Yes.  Perfectly.
Then who did?
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Thank you.
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
So what do I do?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Oh dear.
Of course.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
Elsa?
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Who was that at the door?
Does the yardman come today?
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
She is beautiful.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
Go.
Just go.  We can manage without you.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
Luminal.
Yes?
Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
My monsters?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
You didn't?
Mr....Kay?
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Head.  Not heart.
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
You think so?  That's very kind --
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
Righto.  Let me see.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Of course.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
What rumors might those be?
Quite.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
Yes?
I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow.  Grandfather was a bishop.  Church of...Church of Eng...
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
This is the studio where I paint.
After you then.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
One likes to live simply.
No.  I expect you can't.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Sit?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
