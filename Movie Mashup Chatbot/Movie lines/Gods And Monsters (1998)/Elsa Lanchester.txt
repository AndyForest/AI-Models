More your line.
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
What's our pesky friend up to now?
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
Jimmy.  How are you?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Boris?  Do I look a fright?
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
