I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
How are you?
