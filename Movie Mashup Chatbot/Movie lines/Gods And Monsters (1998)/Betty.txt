Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
Sure.  I loved it.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
It still hurt.  A lot.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
It never crossed your mind?
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
What's to be jealous of?
Weird.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
This looks corny.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Just thinking out loud.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
