Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
I'm not a kid.
You mean us?
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
You liked it too.
I didn't mean to...
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
I wasn't going to try anything.
What's that mean?
If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like <u>my</u> famous person.  Yeah, my own personal famous person.  Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
So what did you think?
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
Fuck you.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
What makes you say that?
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
Thanks, doll.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
We have his note.
But I didn't do this!
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
It's not what you think.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
No!
Well...no, not really --
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
A homo?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You're sure of that?
Then you're as single as I am.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
You ever been married, Hanna?
You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
I'm not married.
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
Tea is fine.
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
Something I can do for you?
You do that.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
What're you talking about?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
You'll feel better tomorrow.
All right.
Need some help?
Did I hurt you?
You okay?
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
You're crazy.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Just take off the fucking mask!
It's too tight.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
I don't know.
Why?
What did you expect?  Bronze?
What won't do?
What'd you say?
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
Your friend?
You're planning a trip?
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
Storm's getting worse.
Do you mind?
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
I didn't have the guts for it.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
I never made it to Korea.
Never gave it much thought.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
Is that --?
Do I have any other choice?
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
No.  Definitely not.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Good.  Let's get dry.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Is that really her?
No.  The girl.
Who's that?
What was that about?
I don't hear anything.
If that's okay?
Do I look okay?
Clayton is fine.
I'm game.  Sure.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
No harm done.
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
You asked me to model.  Remember?
You're the one who started it.
I didn't --
Something happened to him?
This was World War I?
You were a soldier?
You're talking through your hat now.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
Not me.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
You first.
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
Cut it out!
How long were you...?
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
Do you miss it?
What happened?
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
Not at the moment.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
Sorry.  Not today.
Can I see what you did so far?
No.  I --
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
I'm not, you know.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
So you had a wife?
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
Can't today.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
No.  I could have, though.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
I don't like to talk about that.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
No.
I liked it.  We all did.
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
This David's a friend?
Go ahead.
All right, I guess.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
What?
Your family ate dripping?
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
No.  I'm fine.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
It's new.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
But why?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Football in college.
Broke is more like it.
What's to sketch?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Huh?
What was wrong?
What did she mean by going flooey?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
Really?
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
These are your paintings?
No.  Iced tea's fine.
I stink to high heaven right now.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
Nice place.
Mornin'.
Have a drink?
I think I'll hang around.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
I'm up.  Thanks.
Fuck off!
Where's Betty?
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
I just want to watch it, okay?
Good.  Fine.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
