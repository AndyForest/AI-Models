You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
What have you done with him?
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
What do I do?
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
Yes.  I trust you.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
You and he are not doing things?
You did not know?
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
Yes!  You know?
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
He is dead now, twenty years.
Of course.  I am married still.
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Why?
Your wife?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
Expect nothing fancy.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
You will not hurt him?
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
The Master is waiting for you.
No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
A visitor.
Of course.  This afternoon.
Good night.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
She is horrible.
He is not going to kill the old man?
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
