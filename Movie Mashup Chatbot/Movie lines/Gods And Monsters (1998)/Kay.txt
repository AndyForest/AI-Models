Don't go away.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
Right.
I was going to take a swim.
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Can that count as one question?
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
I guess.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Then the rumors are true?
You're serious.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
I don't mind.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Your father was a schoolmaster?
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
Sure.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
