How did you hear this?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
Who took the meat?
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
If we could speak alone.
I hit him square.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
Two days... ?  For murder?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
Stains of blood.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
You will stay at her side?
Bring him.
Bring Young Masbath here.
... Brom Bones...
In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
He is a behemoth.
What are you spying on?
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
No bleeding.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Master Hardenbrook...
Maybe you should take this.
May we look at them now?
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Do you have these persons' wills?
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Pardon me?
I shall, gladly.
Not for lack of trying.
Chosen me?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
At times I do.
Listen to what you say....
I know it.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
Well... so much for common sense.
What is that you wear?
Believe?
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
The militia?
How are you?
I doubt that's the end.
Take the reins.
I know.  Hold on.
Climb up!
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
This is farewell.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
Lady Van Tassel.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Did your father take a loan?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
Man or woman?
Why this tree?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Stay back.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
True enough.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
We should not go much further in this murk.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
We are leaving.
I hear nothing.
What is it?
Witches do not exist.  However...
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
I have others.  All I need is this.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
Are you familiar with magnets?
Look again.
Out there.  What do you see?
What is it?
Up.
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
What is the common thread between these victims?
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
I manage fine alone.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
We have no choice.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
His horse.
He moves too fast.
I do not know.  Away.
Katrina...
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
What would you have me believe?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
What did he say, Katrina?
And, what did he say?
It was you there?
Come with me.
What... what are you doing... ?
Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
Just... keep where you are.
Blood.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
To avenge his father, and the others.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
It was not butchery.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
They have done nothing of the sort.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
If you want.  But...
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
There is no such thing as magic.
Are you so superstitious?
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Small talk.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Let her go!
What... ?
It is fine.  Now, I must...
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
Very little.  I must be going...
Where?
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Yes, actually.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Turn around.  Now!
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
There was not much blood, was there?
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
What... what are you doing?
Can you help?
The Horseman.  Yes.
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
In a way, yes.
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
