I... I can't do this.
Quickly, close it.
Ichabod...
What was that?
The church.
Where are we going?
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
I have not been able to face him yet.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
What is so urgent?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
The skull is gone.
My God... what has happened?
What are you doing?
What did you say?
But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
I apologize if I worried you.
It is only me.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
No, but... why do you ask that?
What?
What has happened?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
What troubles you?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
But, why?  Tell me why.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
And this gives worth to butchery?
Must I hear this?
What are you on about?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Why would you do such a thing?
Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
People have put their trust in you.
You promised justice.
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
I insist that you have it.
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
You made this, and the drawings?
Yes, he does.  May I try?
It would be interesting to find out.
These scars.  How did you get them?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
You are funny.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
He has proposed to me twice.
My suitor?
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Other people?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Forgive me, I didn't know.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Father saw you die.
You... you are alive.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
