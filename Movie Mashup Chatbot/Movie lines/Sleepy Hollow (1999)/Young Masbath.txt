Tired.
What now?
What can we do?
Lady Van Tassel...
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Why... why are you like this?
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir?
What now?  Where is she?
But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
What books?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
No.  They are all missing.
What was she doing?
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Baltus Van Tassel.
What does it mean?
In test... what?
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Yes.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
What good is this?
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
All I saw was their lantern.
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
We should go.
What is it?
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
Should we go back?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
What happened?
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
Listen.
Father said witches live there.
Thank you.
No, I couldn't...
It's spectacular.
What kind of nuts?
The Western Woods.
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
Where are we going?
How could he?
I'm sure I don't know.
I did not ask you to, did I?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
