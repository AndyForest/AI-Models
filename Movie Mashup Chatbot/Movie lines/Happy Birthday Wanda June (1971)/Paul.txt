Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
It's your house, Dad.
I don't want to fight you.
Dad--
Gee whiz, Dad--
No.
No.
Nothing.
Mom?
It's Mom.
Dad?
No.
I'm a man.
What kind of exercise?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Dad--
Can I get dressed first?
A hundred dollars!
Play?
Mom?
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
I can't take my eyes off you.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Sir?
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
They're not engaged.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Sir?
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Mhravitch.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
Where did you get the poison?
Go on.
I don't know.
Uck.
Mhravitch.
Wow.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Tell me that.
"The sting."
"The sting."
Dad was never in England?
England?
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
What's good about that?
He insults him all the time.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
They were in the same creative writing class.
She met him at college.
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
He worships Father.
Everybody says he was so brave.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
I'll see.
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
Where's Mom?
Is anybody besides you here now?
Dr. Woodly.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Are you--do you--
Are you--
Hello.
Sir?
Anybody home?
No.
Don't touch me.
I'll kill myself.
I don't want to live any more.
Thank God!
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
Don't!
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
Don't worry about it.
I don't care what she wears.
Okay.
Yeah.
Really?
He can hardly talk.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
I don't get it.
What?
Mom?
Don't know.
Father's friend.
No.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
It's beautiful.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I didn't know that.
I was afraid to ask.
How did she lose her feet?
Still lives with his mother.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
He's alive!
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
Stay home tonight!
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
He is my father.
He isn't any friend of Father.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
Keeps fairies away!
It's fine!
Don't worry about it.
My father!
Everything stays as it is!
We don't have a maid any more.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
