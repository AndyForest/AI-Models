Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Premature ejaculation.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Yes.
I heard you were looking for me.
