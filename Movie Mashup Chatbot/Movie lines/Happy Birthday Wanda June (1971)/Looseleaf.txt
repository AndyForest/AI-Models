Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I know you think that.
Okay.  Okay.
Me?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
You never played a violin.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Hi, Penelope.
I dunno.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
I dunno.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
I didn't know we had any women left.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Go to the funeral?
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
You told me.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
Huh.
Excuse me.
You know me, boy.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
I dunno, boy.
First Nagasaki--now this.
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
Let's talk about something else.
Haven't got one.
You ever own a motorcycle?
I've been looking at motorcycles.
I'm lonesome already.
Months?
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
How short the skirts are.
You know what gets me?
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
I'm liable to find anything!
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
What'll you do for transportation?
Can I have the Cadillac?
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
You know what gets me?
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
I didn't tell you everything.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
At least we found the diamonds.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?
Must have changed that law.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
How all the magazines show tits today.
You know what gets me?
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Didn't recognize you.
It's a bitch.
I dunno, boy.
I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.
So long, you guys.
I dunno.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
Jesus.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
There was so much going on.
She did?
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
It was a bitch.
I dunno, boy.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
