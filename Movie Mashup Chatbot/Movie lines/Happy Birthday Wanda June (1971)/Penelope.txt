Do it, Norbert.
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
You've killed women?
Out!
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
How do I load?
There it is.  Give it to me.
Where's the bullet?
I mean it!
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
I'm going to call the police.
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
No.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
Honor, I suppose.
No you don't.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
You're begging him to kill you?
He's a child!
Like what?
Sounds quite beautiful.
Blue soup?
It seems highly intelligent to me.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Rifle?
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
I see.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
Just one favor.
Almost a Christmas scene.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Two hundred years old.
He cried.
He knows you shattered his violin.
Unless she has nerve.
Did you like it, dear?
A dozen?
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
I came for Paul as well.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
I came for my clothes.
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
No you're not!
What are you going to do?
I don't think so.
Yes.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
Yes.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
No.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People don't use that word any more.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
You're wrong.
What a honeymoon.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
Breakfast?
I have some change!
I have a brain.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
Turn around?
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
It's so--so stark.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
A trip, you mean?
I did?
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Do say hello to your mother.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Please--
Harold!
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Thank God!
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Shouldn't you lie down?
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We thought it was an emergency.
We thought a doctor might help.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Situation.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Give us time.
Not at all.
How do you do?
Some kind of animal?
What do you do for a living?
This is crazy.
You don't even know me.
I'm engaged.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Sir?
Eighteen--  and a half.
Can I help you, sir?
Heaven.
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
What will you do, Colonel?
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
How horrible.
What happened?
Who's dead?
For what?
Alice is dead?
Dead!
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
You didn't even find that out?
Alice got married again.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
You don't know?
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
Then get him.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
What does he say to do?
What are his symptoms?
That's why I'm crying.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
That man is your father.
For Heaven's sakes!
What's his name?
Then who flushed the toilet?
Is Norbert still here?
Yes, he is.
Who have you been talking to?
Where will you be?
I hate that thing.
I don't really know.
A lot of people don't.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
Not true.
That's an interesting piece of news.
A what kind of doctor?
Thank you, kind sir.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
He's a ghost!
Oh, Paul--
I know.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
You and Harold are friends?
It's true.
You were wonderful.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
I'm sorry.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
Possibly.
What's the matter now?
What was it?
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
Did you talk to Paul?
How nice.
A what?
You figure!
The park!
Is he coming home?
Is he all right?
Did you see him?
What then?
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Coming.
Good night.
I see.
I'm touched.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Yes?
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
I know.
I'm glad.
That's something I suppose.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
Doing what?
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
Please--
Do it!
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
You fool, you fool.
Get out of here.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
I believe in miracles now.
How neat.  How keen.
You know each other?
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
It's a jungle out there.
He's not your son.
We've got to rescue him.
Paul's only twelve years old.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
I'm amazed.
Why would you do that?
Meaning?
It's suicide!
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
That's the XKE.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
As long as he keeps out of the park.
It is?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
What?
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
She quit this afternoon.
We made the date three months ago.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
