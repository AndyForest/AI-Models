Goodbye, Looseleaf.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
If what?
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
Everybody thinks that.
You're an imbecile.
You.
Maybe it's time you got out.
You did?
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
In what way, pray tell?
What's this?
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Sorry.
Really?
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
When?
How do you know that?
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
What's funny about that?
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
The educational process.
How about breakfast, wife?
Could have happened to anybody.
Otherwise, how are things?
And how were things?
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
Go home!
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Let's talk about it some other time.
So long, Colonel.
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Go home.
Go home!
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
The hell with the diamonds!
Go home!
This room is full of ghosts.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
Tell them yourself!
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
At least!
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
Oh, shit.
Home.
I suppose.
Um.
No.
Home is important to a man.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
We'll see.
Home, sweet home.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
We've never met.
A bitch.
Hm?
Miss me, baby?
Thank God!
Out!
Out!  Out!
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
You're hollow, like a woman.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
To make an ass of yourself.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
For what?
What?
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
Fifty years?
That can be arranged.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
Insurance!
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Our pleasure.
I forget mine for years on end.
You've come to the right man.
The posies are for her?
How are you, honeybunch?
I'm talking to you gently now.
Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Open the bolt!
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
That's a rifle you have?
What's this?
What's this?
Who was it?
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
Leave a tip.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Make it fast.
The smallest thing I've got.
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Damn.
Scat!
Will you go to bed?
Penelope!
Penelope!
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Can't it keep till morning?
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
You're supposed to get hurt!
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
Oh hell.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
No.
It makes life spicy.
Excellent!
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
College?
College!
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
Man and boy.
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Life has denied me that thrill.
Ask it!
You were about to ask a question?
Hello.
As a matter of fact--I am home.
As a matter of fact--
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Load it for her.
Help your mother find the bullet.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Stop!
Don't!
You hope this, too?
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
No.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
What a handsome word.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
I plan to live one hundred years!
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
If he thinks he's man enough.
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Things.
Hope.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
If he wants to go.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
Sneaking in the back door.
Why not?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
And no one's there now?
And he keeps it in his apartment?
And what is his most cherished possession?
The doctor.
You learned this in some college course?
Go on.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
Such as?...
Fish can't feel.
It couldn't!
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
That's what you're supposed to say.
What then?
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
You're a woman, aren't you?
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Which one?
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Ram it up your ass!
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
Now--turn around, if you would.
I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
You used to like it stark!
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
Now that's what I call fun.
Say hello to your mother.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Have some.
Nothing would please me more.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
We all are.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
Your old beau?
What's that all about?
Bluh.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Disease?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Like hugging a lamp post.
What's the matter?
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Daughter--I love you very much.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
What time do you get off work, my child?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
"Hamburger Heaven."
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
It's trash now, like mine.
Can't do it.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Get up.
I've enjoyed being man.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
If you want to be found that way.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
I'm going to shoot you now.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
Here.  Finish the job.
Was I ever of use?
You're too modest.
The new hero is you.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
Don Quixote.
I see.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
Poison.
With spittle?
Cut me open.  Find out.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
You hope.
I'm an honorable clown?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
I love you!  Have a cigar!
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
And terror, if you don't mind.
Comical?
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
Now who's being cruel?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
What brought you back?
This is man to man.
There's a certain amount of information there.
It died for your sins.
What for?
You were wrong, you quack!
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
We have, have we?
Wasn't that sweet of me?
Hundreds.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc� is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
She's crying because she's so happy.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
I came back.
I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
And her fianc�!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Ahh--then she's still alive.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
We'll miss you so.
Oh dear.
Hello, Mother.
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
Ooops.
