Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Leave the rifle here.
What are you going to do?
New lives begin!
Thank you--for my life.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
No.
No.  No.
Don't shoot.
What is this thing that kills me?
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
No!
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
More clowning!  Don't you see?
I'm utterly satisfied.
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
My violin is avenged!
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
I've struck my blow.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
King Arthur.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
I'm high as a kite.
Hands and knees, you say?
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
You're a son of a bitch.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
You're old--so old.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
We'll find out now, won't we?
You haven't heard me yet.
Correct.
Yes.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
I thought she was a widow.
Good Lord.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
Are you've seen it work cures?
I've never heard of it.
Would you say that again?
I was going to ask.
You have chills?
You've been bitten by bats?
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
Good night.
None.
I feel the same way.  What next?
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
I've literally got to run!
I've got to run!
And her fiancï¿½!
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Will you please go?  An emergency!
She's fine.  Please--
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect her.  I'll leave right now.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
He's dead, you know.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
It's always locked.
You startled me.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Ooops.
No!
He isn't?
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
I hate that thing.
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
Oh?
You're going out?
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
Goodbye.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
It's really that bad?
Thanks.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
We met here earlier this evening.
That's been said before.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
They didn't murder me.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
I wish Paul luck.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
What kind of a life is that?
The what?
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
This is very good for us.
Tonight's the night.
Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
Take plenty of cigars.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
It's good.  Let him go.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
He died of a massive rupture.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Not true.
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
