No.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
When I wanted to.
No.
Yes, I understand.
You will die.
And then?
Why wait?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
No!
Who are you?
Yes.
I won't get lonely.
Good-bye.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
