She'll have to know some time.
That you love Mary.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
We could tell him.
I don't know.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
But I understand her. That may be more important.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
But I'm not joking.
I'm going to find your sister.
Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you -� you're off to work.
Not I �- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -� "My courage like a white plume" � and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
They may have been friends of hers.
What's wrong, Mary?
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
If it is true � there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
And you believe that?
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
I had begun to write again -�that's whet I was doing when you came in.
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
But you're happy here -- you like your work �-
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me �-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
It's not a searchlight �� it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince �- not stars --
My window - - through which I see the world.
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it �� to know me better.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
I have been at the library.
I have something even better.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
Yes.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything �� and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
What?
I'd like that.
It might have.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
Perhaps
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
Perhaps.
I think it's time.
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -� when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
Yes. When I tell you.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -� we've got to find her.
Wait �- there is that other favor.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I should like people to read what I've written.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ��	one as a detective.
Uh�huh.
I've lost my knack.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Because there was another girl� years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -� I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
