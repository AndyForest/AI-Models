I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
That makes it all the more difficult ��
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
