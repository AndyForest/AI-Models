You could go and open the door.
No.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
No.
Yes.
Which room is it?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Can we go there now?
You think my sister is there?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Where?
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
You can?
What is it?
Do you know what this is, Frances?
Thank you.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
But I like teaching school.
I'll try there.
"The Dante?"
I can't understand it at all.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Hello, Frances.
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -� you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister �� whom I had lost and have found again....
Yes.
Gregory ��  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
Good night.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
We've tried so long to find her.
What things? Why?
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table �� the one at the feet of Dante.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
What have you done about Irving August?
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Yes.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
I'd like that.
A job?
But you have treated me that way.
He was a kind little man in his way �� and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -�  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him �� white �� and the men holding him up between them.
But you do believe me?
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Weren't you afraid?
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ��frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -� waiting �� I feel as if I'd never known her.
Why?
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
You'll be all right?
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
Please, Jacqueline.
I understand.
I keep telling myself that.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -� it fits in with what I saw -� she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
It's because of Jacqueline �� I can't go on looking for her --
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I have to go �-
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
But it's a small room, Jason.
I can imagine.
Devil worshippers!
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
I'm at sea, Jason.
I don't know.
I don't think that's so revealing.
But you're always at the library.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
And you knew he'd be here.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Were you going to make a suggestion?
Would they hurt her?
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
Cloven hoof?
You know where she is?
Dr. Judd?
I don't believe it.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Why?
I'll be out in a minute.
Yes.
I'm afraid not.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
I didn't know.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing �-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
But she was here?
Yes �� yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Of course.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
What did he say?
Please.
She's very beautiful.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
Because I have something very important to do.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
