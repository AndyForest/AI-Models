I don't know.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
I'm tired of being afraid -� of waiting.
I'm afraid.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -�closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
