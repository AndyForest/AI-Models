What circumstances?
But tell me --
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
About forty-five dollars.
I haven't got that much in cash.
I'll give you a check.
How much does she want?
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
What sort of danger?
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
I know �� I shouldn't have told you�
Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -� you know that?
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Who the devil is he?
Please �- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -�
The people at the restaurant?
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
Drink your milk.
Yes, of course �� but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
This is about another murder �� a woman at Fifty Second Street
Goodnight, Mary.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
Good.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -� I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her �� to see her �� to touch her �� in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life �� that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -� something you never get hold of �- something that keeps a man following after her.
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
Not from me.
Let her know what?
What's that?
Could you find him?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want �- surrender herself to the police �� stand trial �� I don't think he knows.
Do you think he knows about this?
Well, that's illuminating.
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
Well?
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
