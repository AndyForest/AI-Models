They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -� this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
No other reason �� no woman ��not the little Miss Gibson?
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish � to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
Tell me what?
You don't expect me to do that do you?
I'd forgotten.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
And this poetry �� like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe�laces; now this sudden humility.
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
After that wonderful first book �- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
What was she to you?
She was my patient.
But why come to me?
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
What a peculiar question.
I don't know.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
No, she's with her sister,
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -�will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
I'm very, very serious.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
No. She's no longer under my care.
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
Unless what?
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
A gay lot -� Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
But you would like to know where she is?
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice �� that's it, isn't it?
I'd hardly describe It that way �- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
