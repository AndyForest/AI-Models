This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it �� your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
I never thought you did.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
Is it about Jacqueline?
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
I was a great dancer...
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
I haven't said anything of the sort.
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
It seems right to us.
One believes -� it's like any other religion...
It won't hurt.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell �-
We haven't even begun tea yet.
