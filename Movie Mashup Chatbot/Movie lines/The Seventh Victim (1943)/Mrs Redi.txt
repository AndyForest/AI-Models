Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
What did she want to know?
And that was all?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
What were you talking about?
What did she want?
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
That's too bad.
Thank you, my dear.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Yes �� and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
I'm afraid not.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
But he also wrote --
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
I should have known. She had no sincerity �- no real belief.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
