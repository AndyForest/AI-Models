You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
Yes.
Thank you.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
How much have you got?
She can only use cash.
She could use a hundred dollars.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
As a man, you distrust me ï¿½- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
