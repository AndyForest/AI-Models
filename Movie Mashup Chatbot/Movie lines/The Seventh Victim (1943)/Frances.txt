I ought to know.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
I guess most people are.
She's a pretty good sort.
Redi's all right.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village �-	"The Dante."
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -� had your picture in her office.
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Why, Mary --
Yes.
She showed me a drawing.
No. She asked about the trademark.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
Nothing.
I did her hair.
