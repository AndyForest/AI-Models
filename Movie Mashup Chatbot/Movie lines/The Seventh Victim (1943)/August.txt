Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Yeah �- sure.
Sure I do.
Listen ��
We can't stand here all night.
I'd like to get out of here.
Let's get out of here.
You scared?
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
I don't like this.
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
You can't tell.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ��  -- used a phony health inspector's badge �� they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
