Shut up.
You mean that body-----?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Are you kidding?
What're you doing here?
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Could this be him?
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
This is enough for me.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Get anything?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Who're you calling?
Well, what'd you think?
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
No.
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Who's your candidate?
What do you mean?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.
Who's is it?
This gun yours?
Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
Have you got a pistol permit?
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
I'm asking you.
What'd he think it was to you?
What's that to you?
What's he want of you?
We were looking for this bird.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
Did you go?
When was that?
He did!
Well, what?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Let him have his say out.
Tell 'em.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
You did!
Goodbye.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
There are a few things we want to check up on.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Good morning --
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
Where were you?
Where were you?
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
Want to take a poke at him?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
