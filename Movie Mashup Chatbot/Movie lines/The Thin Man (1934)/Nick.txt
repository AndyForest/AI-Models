Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
No.
I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
You better take a drink.
What?
Said he stole his invention.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
He's been dead for three months.
Hello, Dorothy.
Don't lie to me.
Where did you get this gun?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Which way did she fall?
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Where did you hit her?
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Yes.
Come on in.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Your father?
Why don't you try him again?
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Disappeared!
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
Probably not.
How did you ever remember me?
Not that scrawny little....?
Yes.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Another Martini --
Yes... yes.
Shrapnel!
I'm very interested in that body.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
--was Wynant's.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
No.
I'll take care of him.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Rosebreen.
Extraordinarily lucky.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Nunheim!
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
I think we're on the right track.
He's holding out on you.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
What about this Nunheim?
What about Jorgensen?
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
No proof?
You've been there?
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
What about the suicide?
So would I.
Man to man, I'm not.
You mean about that gun?
I'll have to try to remember.
No.
No.
Not without a warrant.
Keep on asking.
Ask him.  I don't know.
Nothing.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
I never saw him before.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
It might.
Slim.
That's all right.
How are you?
S'long.
My wife.
No word at all?
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
You did... where?
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
They'll want more than your word for that.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
Yes...
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
Well, don't you?
What do you think?
Hello, Mimi.
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
Why do you say that?
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
This is your party.
I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Why tell me?
All right - you didn't.
I've never heard about you.
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
It's the only way it makes sense.
I don't know.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
I wish you'd tell me.
Yes.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....
Mimi...
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Got a nice evening dress?
Got a nice evening dress?
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
No.  Nobody but you.
Smart gal.
Couple of months anyway.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
Sure.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Huh?
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
That's a fact.
It was his body that was buried there.
He was down in the shop.
I did find him!
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
Sure I will.
Goodbye, darling.
Not with all your money!
You wouldn't be a widow long.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Looks like a hold-up!
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I don't believe he did it.
Maybe I will.
What's the matter with you?
You talk as if I were Asta.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Did I give it to you?
Is that another Christmas present?
Aren't you hot in that?
Macaulay.
Hello... send him up.
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
You must admit I have good taste.
Who gave it to you?
I never saw that before.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
You're a fine watch dog.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
Yeah.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
There's one coming.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Breakfast.
At breakfast.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
They were kidding you.
Maybe it would if I took it.
Maybe a drink would help you.
Can't you get to sleep?
That's jolly.
Yes.
She didn't tell me a thing.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
What are you drinking?
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
Santa Claus.
Take it easy.
That last Martini.
Six Martinis.
Much better, thanks.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
If you like 'em like that.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Oh, this is Andy --
I had him out this morning.
Hello, baby.
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
Trying to put it off on her?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
You worked here?
How did you get in here?
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
