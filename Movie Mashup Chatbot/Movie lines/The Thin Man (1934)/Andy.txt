Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
You're high enough.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Dorothy!
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Do you think I care
What are you talking about?
Go!
You've got to get your mind off this.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
Don't cry.
