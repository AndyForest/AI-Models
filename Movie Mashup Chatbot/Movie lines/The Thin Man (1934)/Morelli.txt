What am I?  The fall guy?
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
What's that?
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....

I didn't knock Julia off.
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
