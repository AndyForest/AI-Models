No... no.
Police!
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
No, Mr. Charles.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Bonds, sir?
Well, congratulations.
