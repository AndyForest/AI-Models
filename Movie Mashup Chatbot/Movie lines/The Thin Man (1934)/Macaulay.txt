What do you mean?
Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
Did he tell you where he was going?
Is your father still in there?
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
I didn't know they had a fight.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
Yes.  But he didn't show up.
About three.
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
He telephoned me today.
Well....
I said he hadn't written me.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
I got word from Wynant this morning...
That's all right.
Good.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Yes?
But what if you need more money?
Is Julia going with you?
What'll I do if something comes up?
Well, let me do that for you.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
But suppose some business comes up...
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I have no right to answer that.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
I see.  I see.
You don't say --
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
How are you?
