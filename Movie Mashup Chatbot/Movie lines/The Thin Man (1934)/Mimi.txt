And I'll give then proof!
Now do you believe me!
There!
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
I didn't.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Shush!
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
No.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
What is it?
What is it? Has he found him?
Oh, here she is.
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Gilbert!
Not a thing.
That woman!
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
That's ridiculous.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
Goodbye.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
No.
Why yes.
I see.
Why, you said...
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
Chris -- Chris -- !
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
What are you going to do?
I couldn't go near that woman.
Chris!
I know.
I'll get some.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
Perfectly absurd.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
But he has nothing to do with it!
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Where's Gilbert?
Dorothy!  Is she here?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
You're always teasing.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
want to talk to you about something very important.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
