He's just around the corner.
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
Just a minute...
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Why not?
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
Go away!
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
And don't ever try to see me again.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
I can't.
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Oh, Andy.
Mother!
Oh!
I don't believe it! You're lying!
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
You hand that over to the police.
Then what are you hiding?
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Don't.  It's horrible.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
Nothing.
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
Give it to me.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
He wouldn't say.
He's waiting for you.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
Dead?
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder -
That's the truth.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
She... she fell over backwards.
I don't know.
She fell down.
Why... in the heart.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
There.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
I've got to see you alone!
Oh, thank heaven.
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
tried him once -
Macaulay.
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Yes.
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
You know, we know each other.
Hello, there!
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
And he still wants to marry me!
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
He's all right.
It's a promise?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
A new invention?
Where are you going?
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
This is my wedding.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
It's been the same one for three months.
