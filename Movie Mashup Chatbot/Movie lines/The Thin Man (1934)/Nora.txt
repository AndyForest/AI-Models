You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
I think we may as well sit down.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
But he's interested!
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Oh, please, Nick.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
I hope you're well.
Why are you saying it?
Is that true?
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
You're going to drive me crazy!
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I wish you'd tell me who.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Mimi!
Who do you think did it?
The suspects!  They won't come.
I've got a lulu -- why?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Yes!
What are you going to do?
Why not?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I'm going to tell her.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
How long has he been dead?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Well, don't they?
What things made you so sure?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Wynant's body?
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Nick!
What do you mean?
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Back to California
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
You dog!
You bet I wouldn't.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
What are you going to do?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
He's just been for a walk.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
Catch me letting you go alone!
So am I.
Why don't you?
But Wynant --- ?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
Sit down!
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Yes.
Yes.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Who's that?
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Finished with these?
You did.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Well, didn't you?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
Want a drink?
I'll get some towels.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Someone get a doctor.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
But it's Christmas now.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
I'd like to see you work.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
No thanks.
No.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Good. I want to talk to you.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
What are you going to do with it?
Where did you get that?
Rye.
Isn't that my drink?
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Room service, please -
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
We need ice.
Who's that?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
What hit me?
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
How many drinks have you had?
By the way, how is your father's side?
Who is she?
You got types?
Pretty girl.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
You might have mentioned me first.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
So it's you he was after!
Was he a good detective?
Yes.
Yes.  Nick!
