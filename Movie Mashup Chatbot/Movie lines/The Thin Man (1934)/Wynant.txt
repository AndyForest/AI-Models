Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
And if it isn't?
Well!
Another young man.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Better get home before it is.
Only in bad weather.
He's a brave man.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
I know -- I know --
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
How's your brother?
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
If you think it'll be all right.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
What would your mother say to that?
Yes, she would.
You see how much we have to say.
Forgive me.  How are you?
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
What did you do with the rest?
You're going to return every cent of it!
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
That's my business.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
I don't like him.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
Who's that man?
So I see.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
No.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Thanks, and goodbye.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
No.
I trust you.
Never mind.
That's just why I'm going.
I'm not telling anyone.
Did you get my money?
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --
Maybe she has.
I know I left them there.
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Who fired you?
Home?
Where are you going?
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
