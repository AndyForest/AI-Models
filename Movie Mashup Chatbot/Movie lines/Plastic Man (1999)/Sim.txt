No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
How long do you leave him in there?
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
So, I guess it worked.
Like Crazy Glue?
What's it smell like?
Okay.
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Oh yeah?
Yeah, and what might that be?
You were looking for us?
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
That's right.
Oh yes you are!
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
We lost him.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
That's impossible.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
