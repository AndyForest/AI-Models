Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
If you loved me like I loved you?
What I asked you earlier?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Consideration?
Icarus?
Then you still love me?
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Icarus, please!  This is important!
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
No, Icky, this is real.
Do you think she loves him?
And you still believe he's going to come here?
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Do you think she will give us the designs?
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Nebbleman.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Icky!  What's happening?
Don't be a child, Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
She says it's not.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
You're not rotting meat.
And you have him?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
It's a miracle.
Don't worry, four eyes.
Icky!
I could have you fired right now.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Vermin...
