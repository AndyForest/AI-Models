Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
Have you been to the water board?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
What kind of chromium is it?
