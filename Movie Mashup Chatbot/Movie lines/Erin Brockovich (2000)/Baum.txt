Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
