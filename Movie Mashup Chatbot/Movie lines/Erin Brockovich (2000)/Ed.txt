Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
250,000?
All of them.
Fax these to this number, okay?
What's she doing here?
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
What the hell is this doing here?
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
Whoa.  Remind me.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
What do you think?  What's this?
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Take it.
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
The extortion, the threats ...
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
You see your office?
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
I did.  Both.
I was wrong.
I don't know what to say.
Ho - ly - shit.
Erin?  What are you --
Erin --
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
You're not gonna be there.
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Uh-huh.
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
No one's taking anything --
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Gee, I wonder why.
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
I'll see what I can do.
Is that what you want?
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
What kind of truck?
What?  Who?
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
Hey.  I like working with you.
I would now.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
I like this case.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
Show me the document that proves that.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
No shit.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
They skipped that step.
And that's what caused the contamination?
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
You wanna talk about --
Is that what I think it is?
What now?
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
You think there's more?
How many families we talking about here?
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
I know how DNA works, Erin --
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
It's not about working hard --
Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute.  We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility.  No, thank you.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
Then I don't get anything either.
Erin --
Erin --
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
What, you think I'm made of money?
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
Find out.
This is the only thing you found?
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
Lemme see it, will you?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
What medical records?
So what made you think it was?
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
You're a girl.
Good.
You do know how to do that, don't you?
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Where's Anna?
Bullshit, you don't.
All I have is hundreds.
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Yeah?
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a r�sum�, make an --
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I'm sorry, Erin.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
If you hadn't used profanity --
Yeah.  I know.
Right.
Corey.
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Yesterday.
