I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
I'm embarrassed.
