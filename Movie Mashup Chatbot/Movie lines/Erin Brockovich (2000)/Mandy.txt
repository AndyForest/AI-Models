Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
I know.  It's an awful lot.
There's something else, too.
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
