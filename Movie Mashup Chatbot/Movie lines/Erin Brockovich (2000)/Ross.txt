I don't know what you're talking about.
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
You're married.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
You come to the right place.
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
Ross.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
