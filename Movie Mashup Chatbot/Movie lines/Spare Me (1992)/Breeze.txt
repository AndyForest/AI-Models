It's splitsville for you.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Sorry about your loss.
Heh, heh, heh.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
I'd buy it!
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Wait! That's an aria!
- canker sore.
Sure, Sid.
No kiddin'.
It was a clearance.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
La da da dalala...
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
Are you guys bruddas?
Hey, you still here?
When you get a chance.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Lemme see your ball.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
