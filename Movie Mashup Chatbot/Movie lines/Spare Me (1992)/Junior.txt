You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
You shouldn't touch her.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
Who's there!
Who's there?
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet?
Junior.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
Someone wants to play with me?
You made me hurt him!
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
SHEILA!
