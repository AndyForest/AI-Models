My poor baby!
Son?
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
He's the guy Buzz.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
The Peter Pan.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
He's no father to you.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
He's not here.
Get that outta your mouth!
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
