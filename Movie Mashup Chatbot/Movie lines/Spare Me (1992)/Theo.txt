The pin machine?
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
A bowler.
I'm looking for a man.
I'm from Akron.
No. I'm from Akron.
You have orange whips?
Nope.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
He's my dad.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
It belonged to my dad.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
See ya 'round Maynard.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
I never saw you.
You're a scumbag.
What about bowling?
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
He says that to all his wives.
I couldn't care less.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I didn't think so.
You got a better offer?
I gotta survive.
I'm getting to like it here.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
Don't say that about my mom!
I'm your blood.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
It looks like dwarf bowling.
What the fuck is this?
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
The small ball.
Putt-putt golf?
Theo.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
I got a right. You're my father.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
She's my mom.
Grace Skinner.
It's mine.
Thanks.
My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
They suspended me for 100 years.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Theo.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
I found dad.
Hello, mom?
Uh...over easy.
How's that?
Theo. Howzitgoin.
Don't tell me, John.
I don't want to play.
What did you do to Buzz?
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Who's there?
Buzz Fazeli.
Knock-knock.
It depends.
I don't like to talk about it.
Where's Junior?
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Why would you help me?
How Mr. Kastle?
I like the sport the way it is.
What ever happened to just bowling?
What if he wants to get out?
Nice set-up.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
You know who I am?
Where can I find him?
He's my father, Millie.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
They suspended me.
I'm a bowler.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
I am a professional man.
Sez you!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Fuck plan C!
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
You're really pissing me off.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
At least I'll die smiling.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
You should.
He's dead Sheila.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
How do you get this thing down?
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
You told Junior that we did it.
I'll be at the bridge.
He's my father.
It's Junior, isn't it.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
Why not?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
You got any broken bones?
Too late for what, Sheila?
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
Zip.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
What are you going to do about your brother?
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
I could let them go for ten.
More than you could afford.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
So why do you stay?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
Really? I kinda like it.
What's plan C?
Sheila, please.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Nothing.
He said he'd sponsor me.
Plan B is your dad.
Well, that was plan A.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
No, I'm fascinated.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Do I want you?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
No. Do You?
Not while I'm in training.
I'd rather you didn't.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
No, not at all.
Whoa.
What does he do?
Where did your brother escape from?
Kinda tough on the butt.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
This is a vicious cycle.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Business.
I came here to have a word with your dad.
I'm not here to - I can't...
Do you know where they're taking him?
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Uh...over easy.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
What's your specialty?
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
Who identified the body?
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Basement bingo?
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Some unfinished business.
I'm looking for somebody.
I'm not here to bowl.
