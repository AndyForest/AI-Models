You have no idea what happened . . .
Oh, George, George!
Oh, George, George, George.
George, darling! Where have you been?
Where're you going?
Just a teensie one �� ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Where's your coat and hat?
Is it snowing?
George Bailey lassos stork.
My baby.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
To keep from being an old maid.
Hi.
Have fun.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Please, let's not stop, George.
After that, who cares?
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Don't you like her?
Thank you.
Well, then, sit down.
Would you rather leave?
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Do you like it?
Tuesday.
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Didn't you tell her?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Have you made up your mind?
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
I'm going to scream!
Ouch!
I'll take it. And then what?
If I told you it might not come true.
Oh, no.
What'd you wish, George?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
You may kiss my hand.
Too young or too old?
Eighteen.
Well, why don't you say it?
Do I look as funny as you do?
Beautiful.
Neither am I.
Uh-huh.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
I don't like coconuts.
I'll take chocolate.
