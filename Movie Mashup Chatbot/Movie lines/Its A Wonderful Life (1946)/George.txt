What did . . .
Don't . . . George?
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there �� he says he's an angel �� he's tried to hypnotize me.
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Good morning, sir.
Where is she?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me �� where is she?
Where's Mary?
Clarence . . .
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
What?
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Made what?
No wonder you jumped in the river.
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow �� you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
What did you say?
I said I wish I'd never been born.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Well, who are you, then?
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Go through with what?
You what? To save me?
I know that girl!
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen �� that's Violet Bick!
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
What's that?
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Of course it's the place.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
Yeah �� yeah �� hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Hi, Bert.
Hey, Ernie!
Today, over at the house.
Well, sure I do.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Mother . . .
Zuzu �� Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Uh-huh.
I know �� I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Will you try to get some sleep?
There it is, good as new.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Well, what happened to you?
Goodbye, Sam.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Oh . . .
Hee-haw!
Yep.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
Big �� see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
Oh �� Welch. That's what I get for praying.
All in . . .
What's that?
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction?  Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
Mother, you know, I can see right through you �� right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
And all's fair in love and war?
Oh . . .
Well then, how do you know?
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Sure �� Sam Wainwright.
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmmm . . .
Uh-huh.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
She's swell.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Oh, it's wonderful.
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Yes, sir.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Is it a charge, sir?
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Anything I can do back here?
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
Okay �� all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about �� build things . . . design new buildings �� plan modern cities �� all that stuff I was talking about.
How's that?
Well, no younger than I was.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Oh . . .
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Harry . . . Harry . . .
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Did you get a doctor?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
I hope it works.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Got a match?
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
What's that?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Violet Bick!
Now, let's hear from you . . .
Say hello to New York for me.
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . .
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Nothing.
Hello, Vi.
Hello, Violet.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Now look, did you buy anything?
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
Hello?
The whole town's gone crazy.
Holy mackerel!
All of it?
When?
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Why didn't you call me?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
Right down here.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Hello.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
It's important.
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Five hundred dollars.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
Yes, sir.
All right, sir.
I'd like to do that.
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
Just a minute �� just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
Yes, sir.
Pop!
Pop!
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Mary! Mary!
Going up to see Zuzu.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Left them at the office.
Yeah, just started.
Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Hi.
Thanks for dropping around.
Darling, you're wonderful.
Oh, Mary . . .
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
That does it �� come here.
You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels �� the oldest champagne �� the richest caviar �� the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
Mary . . .
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
No, I don't want to be rude.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Where'd you get that dress?
When did you get back?
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
About what?
How's that?
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Come on, tell me.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
In that place?
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Ummmmm . . .
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Okay �� what can we lose?
I'm not very good at this.
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Me?
Well, I don't.
Well, hello.
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here �� from Tahiti �� Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
With coconuts?
Made up your mind yet?
