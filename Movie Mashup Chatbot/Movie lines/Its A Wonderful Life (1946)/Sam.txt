So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.
Hee-haw!
Yeah �� old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
