She's . . .
I'm not supposed to tell.
I . . .
Oh, well, I can't . . .
Yes, George?
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
You know where he lives?
Zuzu's petals.
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . .
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
No, of course not.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
No.
No.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
It isn't me!
You have no car.
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
Our clothes are dry.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
What'd you say?
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
By letting me help you.
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
I told you �� I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
Angel, Second Class.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
Oh, no.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Suicide.
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
