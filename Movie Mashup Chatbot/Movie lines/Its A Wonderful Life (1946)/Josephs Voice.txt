. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star �� made second team All American.
Well, wait and see.
Not a soul.
That's the kid.
George Bailey.
I want you to take a good look at that face.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Yes, sir.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down �� a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
