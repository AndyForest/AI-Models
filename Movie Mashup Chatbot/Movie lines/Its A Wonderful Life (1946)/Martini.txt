Please don't go away �� please!
Oh, no �� you don't feel so good.
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Goodbye, everybody!
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
