Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family �� no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Well, all right . . .
But they're somebody's children.
I can't do that. These families have children.
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
