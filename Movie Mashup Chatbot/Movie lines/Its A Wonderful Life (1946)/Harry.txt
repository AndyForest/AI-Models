Hello, George, how are you?
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Say, where's Mother?
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Very funny. Very funny.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Oh, Mom �� I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
I don't care. It's George's tux.
I've eaten.
