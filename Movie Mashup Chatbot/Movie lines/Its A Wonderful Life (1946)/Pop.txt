Have a good time, son.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Maybe you were born older, George.
He's pretty young for that job.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
