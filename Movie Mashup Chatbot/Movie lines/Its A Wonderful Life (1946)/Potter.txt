So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Then foreclose!
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
Well, what about all your other friends?
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
What is it �� a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Have you notified the police?
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in �� providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
They're not my children.
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
