Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
What's that book you've got there?
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child �� simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Oh �� Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
