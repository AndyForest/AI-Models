You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting �� to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
