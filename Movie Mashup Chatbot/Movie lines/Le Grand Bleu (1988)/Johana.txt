Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Of course.
You're leaving?
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
I can't... I just don't know how to...
No.
Yes.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Italian is practically the same thing.
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
The documents are forged.
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
... So am I.
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
What kind?
Is he alright?  What happened?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Why?
... Not yet.
How do you know that?
He can learn.  He is learning.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
I won't, I swear.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
You know what I'm talking about.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What are you doing here?
Enzo!
Is it a poem?
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
The Mamma's there too.
... It's a comfortable place.
Yes...
Well, good night, then...
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Congratulations, Enzo.
Okay.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
No.
And just where are you from?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
What was he like, when he was little?
Have you known him long?
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
You forgot the Hula!
No.
Congratulations.
In a lake.
I think I'll have a coffee.
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Yes.
Hello!
The guy in the Halloween suit!
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Does anybody live to make a second?
Don't you have a heater?
Promise you won't forget me.
Promise me one thing.
You are the father.
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
You've got to tell me what happened?
Why?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
Jacques...?
What are you doing?
... Nothing.
You'll try again tomorrow?
And you?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
You sure?
I'm being a pain, huh?
It's me again.
No... tell me.
Then, tell me a story.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
So have I.  ... Hello?
I got fired.
It's me... Johana.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm going back home.
Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.
Jacques, you set a world record.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
How do you know that?
How can you tell it's a female?
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
I'd better get back now.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Lucky I was there to save you.
... Especially the sneakers.
You look adorable.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
... Okay.  I'll try.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
No... in the hut.
We saw each other a little while ago.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
No.  I'm just depressed.
Way past it.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Haven't you been listening?
It's his heartbeat.
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
What?
You called the police?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Again?
... Sally?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
... And those?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
What are they for?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Wait!  Professor...?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
Will he understand Spanish?
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Why is he doing this?
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
But... how is he going to breathe?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
Who... Who is that?
