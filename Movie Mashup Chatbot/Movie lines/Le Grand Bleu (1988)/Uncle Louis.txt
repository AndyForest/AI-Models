What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?

I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
In my apartment?

Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
