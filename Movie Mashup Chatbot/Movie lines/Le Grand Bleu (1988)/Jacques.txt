I can't.
... I was right about what?
No!  I would never cheat you.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
... How long was I asleep?
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Thank you.
... Yes.
I don't want to erase anything.
He doesn't like us.
Can I come in?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Yes.
What is it?
What?
Good night.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Two years younger than you.
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
Well... about everything.
... Everything.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
... For the mermaids.
No.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Madame...
Your mother?
Enzo?
You're staying at the hotel?
No, no!
People say that?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
No.
It's okay.
That's good.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
I don't have one.
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
You're the best, Enzo!
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
Why?
Great!
Yes, I know.
Enzo...
No...
Fine!
Anything.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
I saw how it has to be.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
You want to lie down for a while?
What's wrong?
You go back, I'll walk.
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
What?
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
I didn't dive.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
You'll understand.
Absolutely positive.
... Not at all.
Hello?
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
Uh... Ah!  A story?
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
I'm still here.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
How are you?
Hello?
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Why?
I did?
Uh... Yes, of course!
I don't know, I just feel it.
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
... The way she moves.
... No?
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
Give it to me.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
My wallet.
You jumped in?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Thank you...
It's too loud for me.
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
I don't know... why?
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
But what brought you to Sicily?
Please, have a seat.
In the lake?
I recognize you.
Ah?!
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
... Are you sure?
Louis, we were French!
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
It's my apartment.
Well... here.
Uncle Louis!
He doesn't hear too well.
Johana... New York.
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
What?
No.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
