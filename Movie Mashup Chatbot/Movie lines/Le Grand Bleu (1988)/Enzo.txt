The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
That idiot!
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Don't.
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
I dive in search of God.  If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
Because you'd laugh.
You risk your life when you cross the street.
What else is there?
Checking out the competition.
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
Jacques!  Johana!
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
Italy!
Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Where did you two meet?
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
This is a great pleasure.
Enzo Molinari.
You know each other?
I tell you she's mine!
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Dollars.
Ten thousand.
How many are, down there?
How did it happen?
Is he here?
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Then tell him to wax it too.
Have the car painted.
Roberto?  How long?
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Try speaking to me?
And... does the voice come back?
What's with the voice?
And where did you say you were from?
... What's your name again?
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
It isn't lit yet.
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
... Push me back in the water...
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
You were right.
Well that's very nice of you.
You say that because you have the title!
I'm concentrating.
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
That's good.
Thank you, thank you very much!
It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
Anybody can have a bad day!
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
You don't have that one, do you?
You still collect them?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
Here...  Here...
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
... I'm listening.
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
Why?
Everything about what?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Why?
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
Get in the car!
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
... And his friend, Johana...
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
What?
Not at all!
Forget it.  I was joking.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
... You married?
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
Well, what are they?
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
What room have you got?
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
I dove 315 feet!
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
