... You take care of yourself, Johana.
Did you tell him?
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
But your man isn't quite a God!
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Does he know?
Are you going to keep it?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
He's shy, not like Enzo.
You're going to live here permanently?
