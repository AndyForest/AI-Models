Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
Fruit.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Hello!
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
Thank you so much!
I'm so happy to see you!
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
Isn't it beautiful!
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
All right, then.
Mummy!
Yes . . .
But that's not true! I've got one.
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
That was what we were led to believe . . .
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
You mean travel by ourselves?
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
That idiot boarder?
What??
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
I shall call him Diello.
It's so beautiful!
God, yes!
That.
This.
Him.
To be known as He!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
Somebody's got to help us!
Mummy!
