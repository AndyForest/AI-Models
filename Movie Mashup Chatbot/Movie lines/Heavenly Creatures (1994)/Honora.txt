Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Bye.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
Is it hurting, dear?
frowns at Henry.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
playfully shoves his hand away.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
That's enough, Yvonne!
Love, you can still write to each other.
stands and walks toward the door.
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
Open this door!
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
is very angry.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
steps back.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
sighs.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
Come on, sit up.

Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
looks startled at the outburst.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
gives her a sympathetic look.
That's coming along well!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
hurries over.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
