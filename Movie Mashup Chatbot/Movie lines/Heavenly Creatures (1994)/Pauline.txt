Look, Mother!
You have it.
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
You have to let me go!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
I'm educating myself!
Who cares!
What does old Stew want?
My name is Gina!
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
Well, I guess I take after you then!
Can I go now?
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
I just want to be on my own for a while.
I'm not hungry.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
He's the manager!
Got an A, Mum!
Hello!
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Bye, Dad.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Mummy!
I know what to do about mother.
I'm coming with you.
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Poor Father . . .
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
Just a couple more . . .
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Let's go overseas . . .
I think I'm going crazy.
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
John has fallen in love with me!
You'll never guess what's happened!!
You're such an incredible woman.
What???
What?
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
That . . .
This . . .
Him . . .
He . . .
Saint Mario!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
I think I'm dying . . .
It doesn't matter.
She's terribly hurt . . .
Mummy!
