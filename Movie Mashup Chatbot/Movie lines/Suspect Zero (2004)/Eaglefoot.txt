A grill pattern.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
