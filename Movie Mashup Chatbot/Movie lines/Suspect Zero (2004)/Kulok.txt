Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Please.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
We have another one.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Just an observer.
What happened?
How are we going to find him?
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
I...
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
All the same killer?
It's quite advanced.
What's going on?
You okay?
Tom, you okay?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
Does one exist?
And you're working with him?
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
What's going on?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
Suspect Zero.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Hello?
I just need to go a little slow.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
And nobody else can do that?
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Then there's the other issue.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
Sue Ann Hanson.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
We did find these, however.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
Not yet. Not about this, either.
Just routine stuff.
He's called a couple times.
I've been thinking about this.
It's a no-no.
There are Agency regulations about this.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
Huh?
Don't be too harsh.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
What's this country coming to?
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
Sex.
And one other thing.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
You got a point there.
This is some serious shit.
"Gone live?"
They're all criminals?
You want to have dinner?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Don't even go there. What's up?
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
It explains a lot.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
A very sexy case.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Doesn't fit.
This is a sexy case.
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
Not especially.
Five months. I love it.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
None taken.
Thanks for the ride.
I'll be back.
Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Sit back.
Kulok.
