Winona.
She's buried.
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
You heard?
Hi there.
Dylan here.
Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
What's the bad news?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
Who knows.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
That's right, Jan.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
