Well, maybe you missed something?
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Hey, where you been?
Take a drink!
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Yes, you did.
No you weren't.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
