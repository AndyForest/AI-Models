What are you going to do?  Hide me?
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
I think we should see your uncle.
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
Back so soon.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
No you're not...
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
I understand.
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
Did you see them run!
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Don't come any closer!!!
We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
Hey...you got nothing here.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
I don't like loading crates.
Didn't show up.
There won't be any this week.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
Wouldn't bother me.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
Nah.
It's the truth, I swear.
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
Count it.
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Scumbag--
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.

This is a heisted car!
You mean it's heisted.

What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
Hey... you got stereo.
This is some boat.  Your father's?

Must have been all the liquor in him.
Friends of yours Michael.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
