What can I say?
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
