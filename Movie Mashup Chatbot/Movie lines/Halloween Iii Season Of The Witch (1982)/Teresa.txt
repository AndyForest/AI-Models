For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
But...
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
The green capsules in the top drawer.
I'm sleepy.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
You know why...with my parents.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
You're intolerable today.
Sure...He lives there?
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
A paper on that one too?
Ok.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
It's still sick.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
No.
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
What is it now?
Anything specific?
Charlie...?
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
It's all right.
I don't mind.
Please take it.
Here.
Do you have enough?
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
