Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
You sure?
That means it's good.
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
Yeah.
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.
I gotta get the stuff.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
Ok.  Wait here.
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Where's the rest?
Whatever.
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
You said it.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
Charlie, this is business.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
$20.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
You getting out too?
Out!!!!
Ok...that's it.
Hey, shut up.
OK, get in.
OK.
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
Quiet please.
Shut up.
Just keep him quiet.
You what?
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
Sure.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
