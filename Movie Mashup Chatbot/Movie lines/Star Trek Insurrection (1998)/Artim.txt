Bye.
No... I want to stay with you...
Anij!
If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
Why not...?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Chase me!
No, I mean...
Do machines ever play?
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Sometimes I do.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
Really?
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
Don't you ever get tired?
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
I don't.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
You're what?
The artificial lifeform was right?
Won't he rust?
Can he breathe under water?
