Yes...
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
I was on threshold of great things.
I had immense plans.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
Go away -- hide yourself.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
Gimme water.
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?  Yes, you know why.  Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  Except me.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
How's yours?
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
I love it.
Do you?
That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...'
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
Yes.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
You were not coming here, to see me?
Why did you come to ... my province.
I'm Kurtz.
