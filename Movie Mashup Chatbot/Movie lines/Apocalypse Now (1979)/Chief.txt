No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
What'd he say?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Looks pretty shallow.
Which way? Right or left?
Will they attack?
What is it?
Signs?
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
When'd you do it?
I --
We're Americans.
What the hell is it?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
Who knows what's up there?
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
No shit -- hot damn --
What're you trying to say, Captain --
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Smoke !
Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
I wonder if that was the same copter.
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
They nail him for it bad ?
I never heard about that.
What cat  ?
Anybody see some smoke ?
