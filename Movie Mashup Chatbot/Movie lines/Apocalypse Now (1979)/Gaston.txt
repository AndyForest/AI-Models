We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
Captain?
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better.  My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
