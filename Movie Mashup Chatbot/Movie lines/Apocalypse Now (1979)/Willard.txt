I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Men of all races -- nationalities --
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
One for all -- all for one --
Esprit de corps --
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
My men --
Sit down -- we'll talk about it.
We need all our fuel anyway.
I said I like all of them.
I like all of them --
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
We need all our fuel.
Well --
Dreadful.
Yeah.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Yeah --
What is this?
Moonby what?
Who the hell are you?
We've been attacked.
Who are you ?
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
A long time.
We do.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
Fat. That's real fat.
Tracks ?
Let's talk about you.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Sort of.
None.
Yeah. Way north.
No.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
Part.
Sure, thanks.
... he's an amazing officer.
Yeah, I know.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Not a thing.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
I know.
God knows.
Looks that way.
That's a light down there --
And the grass?
How much is left?
That we're dumber than we look.
Probably is.
What do you see?
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
How?
What are you doing out here?
A sauciere --
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
Why they call you that?
Chef.
Arch light.
Who knows? Right.
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Listen.
Listen.
Yeah -- like keep out --
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Thta's not Charlie's work --
While you were sleeping.
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
They're not Cong.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
Get in there !
Well, get in there.
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
All right I got a little surprise for you --
I'll go with him --
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
Where ?
Shot himself. What for ?
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Let's go.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
Terminate ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Touchy.
Our Recon flight ?
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
Anyone got a cigarette.
Maybe.
I only met Kurtz once.
Whose orders ?
What do you want ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
They must have seen the fire.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
Charlie?
Maybe.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
I thought he was a lame.
Yeah.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
Your daughter.
What about an American named Kurtz?
Do you know that jungle?
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
American weapons?
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
Who?
Music?
You'll find enough Cong up there.
I met him.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
Hairy ?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
I met him.
Who knows.
When did you hear?
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
No. Walked.
Haiphong.
I got bored in Saigon.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
I'm taking you back.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
What are you doing?
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
Fuck no.
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
I think think a lie stinks.
How did we get here?
No water.
What Truth?
I can handle it.
How's the pain?
You can't have water after morphine.
You've gone crazy.
Yeah, I like it...
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Yeah.
Do you know me?
You know you're right.
What do you mean, Colonel?
No -- no, sir.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Both of us...
Yes, I know...
You knew him best.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
No -- leave it --
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
Sure.
He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants.
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
When?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
This one , Lance?
Which one's the Colonel's?
Then let's get the hell out of here.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Are you finished surfing?
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
What's that?
What?
What is this bridge?
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Why?
That's me.
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
Who are you?
And shut up.
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Why didn't he shoot you?
So Kurtz is alive.
You're Australian?
Why did they attack us?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
What if I say no.
So that's it.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
The river is beautiful.
I know.
Yes.
What things?
What did you hear?
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
No. Not really.
I should be checking on the boat.
I'm sorry to hear that.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
What show ?
I do.
Right now -- I am.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
C'mon --
What?
Where's your chief supply officer?
Son of a bitch, sir.
Well , who's in command here?
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Anyone got a card?
