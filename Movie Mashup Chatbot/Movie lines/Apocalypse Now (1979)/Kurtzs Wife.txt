Were you with him, when...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
And you admired him?
Did you know him very well?
