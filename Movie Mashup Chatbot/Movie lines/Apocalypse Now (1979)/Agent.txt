I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Two whole drums --
Get out --
You can keep your fucking fuel --
No -- absolutely not --
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
You're out of your skull --
What !
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Where are you headed?
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
