Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
Still time.
Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
So what do you want?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
Then who's the Banker?
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
In over your head?
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
