You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Sorry. What?
What happened?
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
What?
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
Keep it up.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
You're a weasel.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
What'd he say?
Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
King ain't gonna like this.
You going to have the time?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
What?
