Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Come on. Harder.
Come here!
Come here. Feel this.
Look at you, you skinny prick.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Listen, Scooter --
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Stake you?
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
How much?
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Why not?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Minus one.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Speak.
A Fed? Is he close?
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
