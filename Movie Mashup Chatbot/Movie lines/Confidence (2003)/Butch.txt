So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
After you cut her loose.
Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
She had you tempting fate.
Like what?
You're a superstitious fucker.
Nice.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
But there were other factors.
I can see why you liked her.
So how'd you get caught?
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Keeping the Fix happy.
And these cops? What do they get?
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Grifters...
That's not a bad place to start.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Know who I am, Jake?
Ten is standard, sir.
We'll take care of it.
So we go to the bar.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
