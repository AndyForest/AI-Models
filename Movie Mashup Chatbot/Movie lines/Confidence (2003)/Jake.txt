Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Two million.
The standard ten.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
There'll be red flags.
This has to happen fast.
We had to finalize the deal.
Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Guess so.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
Today? Started off great...
She walked.
We were back on.
It's not true.
I was doing it for them.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
Isn't it always?
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Just the last three weeks.
Gee... What makes you say that?
The Anti-Christ?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
That's it.
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
We'll use the Euc.
Eight A.M. flight.
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
She's up for it.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
We pay better.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
Two million.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Tonight. Just me.
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
You know what we're doing with the money.
Well, this is just fucking great...
It can buy you a new and better you.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
I told you, use less powder.
I think I just broke my hand.
No thanks. I'm good.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
Excuse me?
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
I need you to stake me.
I think two million.
Why?
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
No. Just confidence.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Because you killed one of my crew.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
I can't do that.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
You can't cheat an honest man.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Minus one.
I have a good crew.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Something stupid.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
Very much so.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Help me.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
What do you want? An apology?
You tell them the "Tale".
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
Sorry. I didn't know...
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
What about what?
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
Lily... Jesus Christ...
He was looking out for you.
Glenn talked you out of it.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Sounds respectable.
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
How do you deal with --
Don't ruin this for me.
Intuition.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
It's what I do. It's my job.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
I don't trust anyone.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
And some new clothes.
You need to get a haircut.
Don't worry about it.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
I'll worry about Customs.
Just play a part. A little acting.
You get an equal cut.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
You interested in a little work?
We're not cops.
And we got rid of the red head.
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Him.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
We're getting a little old for running.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
Good point.
What?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Breasts.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
We're working for the King.
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
I'm getting a ride.
Meet me at my place later.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
It's bad luck.
Miles...
Yeah.
Stop waving that thing around.
Then shut up.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
This is embarrassing.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
Eee Oott Auught!
Stand up.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
That was fucking deep.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
I'll find the time.
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
It's not history.
I can handle it.
The King.
Can't say.
A little bit of both.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Pretty much.
Pretty much.
Aces, Suits.
Just a tip.
I try.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
Confidence. It's just confidence.
Ten percent.
