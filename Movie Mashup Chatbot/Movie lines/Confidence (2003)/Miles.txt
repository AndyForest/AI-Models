I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Fuck that. We're going too.
We're going to give him the money back?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
So what? We hide, right?
Mob?
What's a King Pin?
Who's that?
Jake? Customs?
And we got rid of the red head.
Escorts!
What do we do? We change the scam?
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
Where the hell is she?
You sure?
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
Is it all fugasi?
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Uh...
Why?
What do we need another Shill for?
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
You sure we're clear?
My place.
Your mess.
Tick-tock...
