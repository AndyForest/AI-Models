How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
"The Strawberries"?
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
Who?
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Who?
Why?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
