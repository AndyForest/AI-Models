That's that, then.
No question, huh?
Not many.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
You up to it now?
A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
That's natural.
I realize this is a shock.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Roy Dillon?
