Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Can't move.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
Want a look?
Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
You brought a case? Good.
Here you are! Two rich people!
These machines -- They're in here.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
