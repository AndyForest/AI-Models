Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
I'll get you a check.
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
