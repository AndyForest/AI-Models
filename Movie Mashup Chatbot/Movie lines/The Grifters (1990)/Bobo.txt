Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
You know it, Lilly.
You're a thousand percent right!
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
You want a drink?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
You'll never shit right again.
What's that, Lilly?
And if you do it wrong?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You ever hear about the oranges?
I'll loan you a raincoat.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
You expect me to buy this?
Motherhood.
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
Your what?
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
