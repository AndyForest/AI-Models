That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Perk, remember?
Oh, come on, Roy.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
No?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
What's up?
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
Kaggs. Home office.
