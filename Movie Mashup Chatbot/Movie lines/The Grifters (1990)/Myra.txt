Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Henry, no!
We're not really interested, Henry.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
So here we are!
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Goody!
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
It's not your fault.
All right.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
But they must be! They cut glass!
What is?
But what's wrong?
Why? What's wrong?
We'll work something out, Joe.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Joe, you know you'll --
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
You heard the shower, didn't you?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
What is it? What's going on?
Bullshit!
For Christ's sake, why not?
What?
No! Because I --
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
What?
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
I saw her.
I went out to Delmar.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
Open it and find out.
Open your door.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Think about it. Okay?
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just...
Atascadero.
Upstate.
He retired.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
The long end. Big con.
Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
The tap. What you do for a living.
Oh, come on, Roy.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
You already went back to work.
I'll sign that affidavit.
No.
Big spender.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
I don't see why we have to take the train.
I'll see you when you get home.
Get well soon.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
I want to know everything about you.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
No, baby. Come to Mama.
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
No more than this?
Roy? It this all we have?
Look at me.
Roy?
Are you sure?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
