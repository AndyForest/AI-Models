What did he do?
You mean if I get sick?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
He's lying.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
... Thanks.
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
How old is he?
Nice-looking kid.
Perfect fit.
I'm not the same person you remember.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Where am I?
Drive.
Yeah -- me.
Or reactivated the first one.
Why would he need more?
And this thing can grow it?
For being one helluva guy.
Thanks, Pollux.
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
That's not the worst part.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
Like ...
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
What do you mean?
So?
Pollux ...
They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
Hey, bro ...
Would it?
That's what they always say.
How is he?
Eve ...
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
What more proof do you need?
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
Don't hang up ...
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
One last time.  It's important ...
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
How come?
Were you there to catch me?
So you had a nightmare.
Must've been after we got engaged.
Something good?
It's important.
We need to talk.
Is that what you think?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Which ear was it?
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
Go on.
How's Loomis?
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
Jamie ...
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Stay away from my family!
What are you going to do!
What are you going to do, Castor?
You killed them?
It can't be.  It's impossible.
-- Castor?
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Pollux is -- what?
I'm going to have you fired.
They're too tight.
