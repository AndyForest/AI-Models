This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
Now what?
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
