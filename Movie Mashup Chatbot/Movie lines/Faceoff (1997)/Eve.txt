Damn right.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Jon, what is it?
-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
What do you mean?
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
I took it from my fake husband.
How did he expect to do that?
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
Whoever you are, don't call again.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Who is this?
Is someone there?
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
And you wouldn't be.
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
No.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
... I was dreaming ...
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
I'm late for surgery.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
I'm going to the powder room.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
-- Yes.
Nothing.
-- Studying.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
You're wearing your suit --
... That's great.
-- what?
You always say that -- then you leave.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
-- I've got to study.
No.
What is with you tonight?
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
The hospital.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
