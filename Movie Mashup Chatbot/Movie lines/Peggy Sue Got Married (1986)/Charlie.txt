Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
I'll never give up.
Oh, God, Dion.
I'll just set it right here.
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I thought you were...for a while.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
Come back to me.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
What the hell is that?
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
I love you.
It opens, too. Look inside.
Of course.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
What?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
Right here. Now sit down.
You're going to listen to me.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
Does this mean you like me again?
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
That's real big of you.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
How'd you know about that?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
What're you doing here?
You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
But what has to be different?
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love �� Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
Let's go down to the basement.
I have to talk to you..
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Save it.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Who?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Is this slow enough for you?
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Great, isn't it?
Yeah. Like that.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
Looking good out there.
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Want me to drive you home later?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
I call this the staccato.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
How do you feel?
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
I'm not going.
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
You got a Tab?
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
And nothing will ever change that.
But you love me don't you?
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
We're here on the sofa bed...
And we're here on the couch...
Of course.
What would that be, sir?
Yes, sir. Trust is a two�way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Yes, sir.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
