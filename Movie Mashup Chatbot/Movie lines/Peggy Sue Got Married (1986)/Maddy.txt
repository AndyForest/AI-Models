Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Peggy Sue!
That's disgusting!
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
It must run in the family.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
