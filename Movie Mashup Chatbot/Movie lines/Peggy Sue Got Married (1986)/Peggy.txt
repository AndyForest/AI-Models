Do you have to wear that hat?
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Good�bye, Grandma.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
Do you believe in all of that?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
How do you like my hair?
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
What happened?
What's the matter?
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
That loud�mouthed little bitch~
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
On what?
He does?
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
I don't get it.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
Where is it?
I can't. It's all too much.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Carol!
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Then hold me.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
What about Janet?
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charlie? Was I dead?
I'm trying.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
I've got to go now.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I know.
Oh, Charlie.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Forget it, it'll never work.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Just take a look at it.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
I just can't trust you anymore.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
What are you doing here?
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What am I going to do with you?
Why?
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Charlie. About last nights..
What do you know about classical music?
I'm sorry Charlie.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
Charlie, let's make love.
You really love me, don't you?
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Come on, let's dance.
He's trying.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
Charlie, how are you?
Right. I promised my mother.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Where did you get that sweater?
Good.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Thanks.
Would you?
They'll learn to live with it.
Why wait?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Refresh my memory.
Oh yeah?
You drive like a maniac!
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Pretty strange.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I know. Put Scott through college.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Charlie...
Don't say that...
Have a nice day.
I beg your pardon?
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Touchy, touchy!
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Test?
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
But I'm remembering the future.
I wish she hadn't.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
Don't get your hopes up.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
It was Beth's idea.
What?
I thought I knew everything about him.
Ssh. He's great.
It's Charlie!
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
I hate chickens.
I can't do that.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
For everyone.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
I'd love to.
Is that one of your poems?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Don't you get along with your parents?
What are you shooting for?
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Coffee and a donut.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
You don't?
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
Oh, you're both so naive.
Oh no!
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
He'll win.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Yes.
The hat business is in trouble.
Quiet today?
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
I closed my Christmas club.
Open it.
Hi, Dad.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
At my age? Don't be silly.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
That would be impossible.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell�O.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Way to go, Mom!
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
I don't feel very festive.
For what?
What do you mean?
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Who was that man?
The house payments.
Sort of.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
Oh. I forgot.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
I'm home now.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Mom!
I'm excused.
I have a note.
Mom!
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips.
Don't eat the red ones.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
I'm just happy to see you.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
But accidents can happen.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
You have an incredible memory.
Rosalie Testa!
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
I came to say goodbye.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
I couldn't help it �� I loved him.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Like what?
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Hi, Richard.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life�styles.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
When do we start?
Sixty�forty.
Wbat're you talking about?
Give me some credit, will you?
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Richard, take it easy.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
What're you doing?
Am I dead or not?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
I don't know.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
What's inside?
I	know what a burrito is.
What's that?
Sort of.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
What a great kite.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
What was?
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
