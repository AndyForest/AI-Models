Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Does everybody have to hear?
Please don't shout.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightï¿½headed.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
What does Charlie think about that?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
Isn't that awfully forward?
Would they go over my girdle or under?
I'm not the maid!
Where have you been?
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
Maddy's party.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
What happened to you?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Would you get that, dear?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
What about?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
When did you start drinking coffee?
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
How do you feel?
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
