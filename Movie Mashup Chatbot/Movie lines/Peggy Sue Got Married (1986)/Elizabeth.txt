What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
I'm not telling.
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
Peggy Sue!
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
