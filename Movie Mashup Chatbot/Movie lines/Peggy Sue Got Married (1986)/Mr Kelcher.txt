Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Hello, Charlie.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
This morning was good.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
For me?
Doing some shopping?
Evelyn, take her to her room!
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
All right. But this better be good.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Thank God for that.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Damn that Charlie I
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -ï¿½how could you do that?
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
