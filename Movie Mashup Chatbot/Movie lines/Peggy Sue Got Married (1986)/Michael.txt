My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Can we split now?
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
What a treat.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
You think so?
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell�O for me, Mom.'
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
This is great reefer.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
What're you doing here anyway?
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author � fat, violent, drunk...
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
