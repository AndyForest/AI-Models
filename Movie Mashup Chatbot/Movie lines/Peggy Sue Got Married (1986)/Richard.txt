Wait! I'll go with you!
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Did you break up with Charlie?
So are you. You've got a vision.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
What's the matter?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Will you take of f your blouse?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
Silicon is from sand.
What will they be made of?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
What are you doing?
High tech. I like the sound of that.
What are you talking about?
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Come on. You can't be serious.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty�fifty.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
There's one way to find out.
You're giving me the creeps.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
How, did you know about my grandfather?
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
Okay. I promise.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four�thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It really wasn't that difficult.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Dancing with you.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four�eyed worm.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
You look exactly the same.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
