Better now, son?
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
What, Jim, what?
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
Sure ... fine.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
What did it look like?
Jim -- what's wrong?!
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
If we want it, it is.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
That's the Air Force Base.
You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
We're going to be moving, son.
Son ... are you awake?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
What's wrong, Ellen?
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
I'm home now.
I left it at work.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
I'll take you to school.
Is that all he said?
What did he talk to you about?
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
