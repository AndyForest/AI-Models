I was so scared.
It was so real, Dad.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
First lemme look at your necks.
I had an awful dream.
Was there anything over the hill?
Are you all right, Dad?
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
Okay.
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
... and Rigel.
There's Cassius ...
There are more this year than last.
Why, Dad?
A meteorite, Dad, look!
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
Let's check it out, Dad.
Is the hill ours too?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
What's that, Dad?
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
Do we have to?
Yes.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
What is it?
I know a way.
Hide the car.
Did you call the State Police?
Who are you calling?
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
They'll get us.
No.
I swear it was here.
No, but it was here.
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
I'd believe him.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
Yes.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
No.
What kind, Mom?
I have school.
When?
Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
The back door was open.
What? -- I...
What happened to your other slipper?
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
