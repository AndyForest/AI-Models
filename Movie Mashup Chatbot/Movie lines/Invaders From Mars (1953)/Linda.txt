Why, yes.  Why?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
Of course.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
Mr. Gardner, I --
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
We were having a little talk.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
You're looking for life?
Let's try.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Don't go in.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
Damn.
No one comes here after dark.
All their lines were busy.
The State Police.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
But it's not, Jimmy.
I don't see anything.
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
Where, Jimmy?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
Do you know how to follow a map?
Why?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
Can you tell me about that?
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
All right.  I'll be right back.
Why, yes.
What's his family background?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
