Good night.
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
George, you're acting very strangely.
Yes -- but ...
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
Where's your car?
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
What?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Your father asked you a question.
George, where have you been?
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
