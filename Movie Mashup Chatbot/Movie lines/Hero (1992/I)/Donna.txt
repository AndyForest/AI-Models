You mean John Bubber?
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
It's November.
How recently?
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I got your bail continued.
