Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Allen?  He... he's okay?
It was you!  I thought I heard...
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
The bathroom!  For two days?
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
LaPlante!
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
I know a guy who only has one leg.
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
"A little mistake"!
You do?
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
It's not right, Gale...
Bodybuilding!
Gale...
That's not what I mean...
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
Vietnam!
Uh, right.  A... news story.
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Yes.
Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Uh, er... I...
