No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!

LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
