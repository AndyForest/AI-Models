The Presidency.  The public loves him.
It's not unthinkable.
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
She wants to quit?
Quit?  She wants to quit?
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
What about a reward for coming forward?
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
Ticket!  What's going on?
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
You didn't?
Never reach out!
