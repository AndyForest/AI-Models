Uh, no.
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
Here.  Get off here.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
What picture?
Were you in it?  In the war?
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Dad!
What's "cynical"?
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
I... I saw him out the window.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
He lost a shoe!
