Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Bernie, how'sa kid?
We're all assholes, Bernie?
I didn't even know you had a kid.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
Spanish kinda guys!
