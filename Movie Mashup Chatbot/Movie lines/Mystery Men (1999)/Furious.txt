It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
Sure.
Hello?
I dunno.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Frankenstein!
So are you!
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
Against.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
You're nuts.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
Monica!
What?
And what if you get killed?
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
What are you talking about?
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Monica, where are you?
I just want to be a superhero.
Me, too.
What have they got that we ain't got?
It's home.
Roy.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
I wouldn't mind being famous.
It is?
Why?
Sure.
Yeah.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Every night.
Hi.
Or talk?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Good or evil, what's the difference?
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos!
My heart died a long time ago.
When are you going to take off that mask?
And a skunk stinks!
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
You're the Sphinx.
Cover me!
I'll drive.
But she still might call!
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
But I just don't feel it.
Because that's what it is.
So what else has Superman got?
SO WHAT?
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
You sure that's how you spell it?
Good point.
Have you ever seen him?
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
We had an off night, that's all.
LOOK!
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
Come on.
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Oh shut up.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Sounds good.
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Shhh.
Well they've crawled back out.
The who?
Let's go.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
See ya tomorrow.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Who's chicken?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Nah.
Why not?
So why don't you just tell her!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em!
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
