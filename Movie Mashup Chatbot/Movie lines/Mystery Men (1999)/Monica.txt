Stay away!
Who?
What?
I'd better go.
Curiosity.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Who's the artist?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Hi.
Sure -- I guess.
Really?
Just a waitress.
Really?
Bye.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
I'm going inside.
At the Frankenstein Center.
It's me.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
You don't seem very angry right now.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Yeah.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
Have you always lived here?
What's your real name?
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Who wouldn't?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
I admire you.
That was easy.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Date?
Alone tonight?
Not tonight.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
Here you go.
So what can I get you?
Really?
Wow.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Are you famous?
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
You guys going to a costume party?
