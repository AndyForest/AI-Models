But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Let's do it.
No one will believe us.
Me, too.
But in fact... you'd found it.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
I can't.
The Inscrutable Six?
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
Who are you?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
What's that?
So where's the art?
Roy --
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
Maybe there was traffic.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
Agents?
Maybe she's right.
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Wait!... Look!
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Or flowers.
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
So you're chicken?
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
I can't.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
But look at him... and look at us.
There's a vague similarity.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Yes, Obie-wan.
Firepower costs money.
The Eradicators!
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
But... only when no one is looking.
Ow.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...
Not yet.
We're superheroes.
You did?
It is?
I use it... to fight evil.
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
Mother... it's not what you think!
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Oh hi, Mom.
Through there!
May the forks be with us!
With or without him, we gotta go!
Oh no.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
That was too close.
But how do we get in?
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
Are you sure he's still alive?
Whatever our name is.
And a social life.
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
And there's the Sphinx.
Do we have to?
Shut up.
Be a Mohican.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Or both.
This looks like a job for Superman --
The Disco Boys.
This is bad.
Ask her out.
She likes you.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
