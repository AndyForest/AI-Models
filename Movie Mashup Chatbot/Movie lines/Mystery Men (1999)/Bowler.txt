Hey, do I look like a Man?
Atta, boy!
Do it, big boy!
We could really use some coffee --
Much less go outside.
I was eight.
He was the last time I saw him.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
The Disco Boys.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
Really?
I'm his daughter.
Or even what it looks like.
Sounds good to me.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
But you're a superhero.
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
How about... the Savage Six?
He was cute though.
I'm the Bowler.
Eat your mustard.
Hey... you okay?
Mon Captain, it's for you.
What did he mean?
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
I thought you'd never ask.
Think positive.
Get on to yourself!
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
He's dead.
Thanks.
It's me... Elizabeth.
Doctor Heller?
