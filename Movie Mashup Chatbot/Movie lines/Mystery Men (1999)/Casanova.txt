That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Except for one little thing.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Really?
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
I knew you'd know.
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
I thought you were done?
Fantasizing... about you.
Head hunting.
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us?
It must have slipped my mind.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
That boy's got talent.
Why bother?
Superheroes.
I got it.
Have you considered my offer?
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
And the light goes out...
You're dead.
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
Are you with me... or against me?
They always call the great ones nuts.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Captain who?
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Roy.
I saw him walk you home.
You're a spy.
Remember the cat.
Then why are you here?
Come here.
Me.
Why not?
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Terrific.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
You underestimate yourself.
Are you an actress?
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
