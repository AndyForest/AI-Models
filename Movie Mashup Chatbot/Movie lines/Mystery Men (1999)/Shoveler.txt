Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
Atta, girl!
Come on, baby!
And some sandwiches --
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
When was that?
We didn't think this through very well.
So who killed him?
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
With what?
Not a chance!
Are you coming or not?
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!
GET MAD!
This place is built like a fortress.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
But there's still only six of us.
There's a big difference.
There's just not enough of us.
Yeah.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
I'm liking this.
And it would be the right thing to do.
What are you talking about?
So when are we gonna have an on night?
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
Oh don't start that again --
Right.
Where am I going?
We've got lift off!
It's time.
Great timing!
It's suicide.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
The bazookas?
Are you sure he's still lives here?
To us!
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
The who?
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Be a Mohican.
Sorry.
Or Batman --
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Who are they?
Definitely.
Hi.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
