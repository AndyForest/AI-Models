I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Show me.
Blow me.
I don't want to.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Yeah. What?
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Not me.
I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
Hi.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
No, he's really evil.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Well, it's kind of weird.
