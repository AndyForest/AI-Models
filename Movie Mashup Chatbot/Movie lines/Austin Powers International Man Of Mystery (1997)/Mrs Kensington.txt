I love you, Vanessa.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
I'm proud of you.
You didn't...
How's Austin?
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
