You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
Ow! You shot me!
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
