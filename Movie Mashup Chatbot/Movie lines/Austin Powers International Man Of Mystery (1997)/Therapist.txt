That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Scott.
We don't label people here, Scott.
What do you want to do, Scott?
And how do you feel about that?
We don't judge here.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
