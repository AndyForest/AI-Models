Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Come on now.  People are smart.
How could it not?
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
