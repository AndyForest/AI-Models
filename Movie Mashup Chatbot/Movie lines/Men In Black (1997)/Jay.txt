Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
After I got the shit beat out of me!
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
Kay!?
in case I need it?
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Do his job.
Would you call this a code 100?
All of it?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
For how long?
Since how long?
What are you doing?
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
Kay--
What if he's telling the truth?
I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
The Pentagon.
Jesus Christ...
Jesus...
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
You think that's what's-happening?
The radio show?
What's going on, Kay?
Looks like a train ticket.
And what's this ... ?
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
Gee.  You really think?
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Now what?
A what?
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
what's this?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
What?
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
Um-- Kay?
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
Ha ha.  No, really.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
It's a bug.
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Sure.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
They respond to fear, right?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Actually... I don't know.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
So... how did they get here?
When?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What is it?
Why not?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
Actually, you may have.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
