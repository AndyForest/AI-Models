Yeah ... ?
What are you doing?
Are you sure you don't?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Out of focus?
What the hell does that mean?
What do we do?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
Do have any idea what I just said?
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
The what?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Come again?
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Scientific American?  Really?
