Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
No. just peace on Earth.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
You got smeared.
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
...touch that.
It's not even a fucking door.
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
Cowan--
Cowan--
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
The hell were you thinking?
You shot an eight year old girl.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
The hell happened?
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Yup.  Sure is.
Don't worry about it.
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
I wasn't scared...
Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of.
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
What?  I thought you just--
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
You heard me.  You two, especially.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
INS, Washington.  Special services.
We'll take it from here.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
There wasn't time, sport!
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
You were saying?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
In case I need it.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Right.  Oh, and here.
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
I'd double it and add 20.
It's marble.
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
How does that help me?
He's here to help!?
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
We're rising.
Get back in the car!
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
I think that's what's happening...
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
Where to?
What?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Something's wrong here.
There's a god damn good reason.
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Hold it.
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
Let's check am out.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
You don't know me at all.
Why?
It was a long time ago.-
I taught kindergarten.
You don't know the half of it.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
She didn't even know you. .
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
So what's the problem?
Right.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
We wear black.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
You figured what?
Maybe you need a closer look.
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
Goodwill...
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Did he say where?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Yeah, I'll talk to you.
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
This guy.  Where was he?
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
Wait-- listen--
Which way?
We need to talk to you about the alien.
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
May I have a look?
This it?
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Yeah?  What's up?
Oh shit!
Did it leave?
Where's he making his big speech?
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
And they're buying it?
I'm getting a trajectory...
Dee?  What are you doing here?
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
What the hell is going on?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Fine.  Good.
