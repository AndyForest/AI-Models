I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
I promised I wouldn't tell.
Found it.
I wanna make a deal.
Will it lower the curve?
What if I don't?
They're not my pals--
