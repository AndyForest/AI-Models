And if I say yes?
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
I gotta be honest about something.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
I guess I lost:
What the hell...
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Hesitated, sir.
It'll make sense later?
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.

Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
They don't?
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
All the time, sir.
Actually, sir--
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
