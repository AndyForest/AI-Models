Uncle, 'tis a shame.
I'll not endure him.
'Tis he.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
I am for you.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
