Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Am I like Such a fellow?
The what?
Why, what is Tybalt?
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Romeo will answer it?
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Romeo! Romeo!
Art thou hurt?
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Every man betake him to his legs.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
At thy good heart's oppression.
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Of love?
In love?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
But new struck cuz.
Good-morrow, cousin.
