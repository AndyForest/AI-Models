Goodnight.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
She'll not come down tonight.
