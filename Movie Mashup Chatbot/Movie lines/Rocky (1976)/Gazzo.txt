Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
You think I don't hear things?
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
