Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
You have my food in ya hand.
That's it.
That's it, I'm broke.
Bob.
Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
