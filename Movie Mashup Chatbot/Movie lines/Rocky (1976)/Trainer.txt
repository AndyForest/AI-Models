Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
You're hurtin', man!
Get that doctor.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
He won't last one round.
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
You's the novelty, Champ!
