Don't say that.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
What're we going to do?
Apollo?
...What?
Is everything all right?
What did you say about a pet shop?
What was that you said about a pet shop?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...Yes --
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
...And he called the reporters --
I thought it might be cute.
-- The legs.
Don't want weak legs.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Like?
Don't you open them anymore?
Yes.
I'll be waiting.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Don't tease me.
...What?
...T-thank you.
What?
I should leave.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
No, I don't belong here.
I don't think I belong here.
It's not that --
It's fine.
I think he might be worried.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Do you have a phone?
I sold them to you.
...No thanks.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Morning after?
I don't think you're a bum.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
It doesn't bother me either.
...I suppose.
...I suppose.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
By accident?
Ohh!
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
And you never got the chance?
...Aren't you skating?
I think it's closed.
It's Thanksgiving.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
...I don't know.
...I'm sorry.
...Fine.
What?!
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
Owe you what?
Don't do that again!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Only a pig would say that!
...Paulie. Stop now!
Don't talk like that to him!
It's not your house --
Paulie!
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
You didn't!
Oh, Rocky!
Paul.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
I can't go out.
...Like you?
Paulie, please --
No... I can't!
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
