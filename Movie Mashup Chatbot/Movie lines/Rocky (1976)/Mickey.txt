Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
You can forget about sparring, kid.
What's happenin' here?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Great, kid, great.
...Yeah.
Wanna keep goin'?
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
How you holdin' up, kid?
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Ya nose is broke.
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
Real good.
God bless ya, Rock.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
...Shrewd.
Whatta you get outta this?
Don't you care what the people will say?
Check the eyes, Ben.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
Please, kid.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Ya got heart.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Whatta' those?
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
What's happened is freak luck.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
How do you mean?
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
...I said that before.
'Bout an hour ago.
Here's the card?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Did ya get the message, kid?
Think about it.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Ain't they?
Rice is a bum.
...Who'd ya fight?
Did ya win?
...Did ya fight last night?
The legs must be goin'.
More like thirty.
How old?
How old are ya?
Facts is facts. I run a business here -- I'm cleanin' house --
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
Dipper needed it.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
...What?
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
