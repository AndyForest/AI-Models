Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Reilly, what're you doing here?
What the hell's going on?
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
What about the ballistics report?
Prints?
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Pull back. You're only an observer.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
It's our only option.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
What's this?
I thought I told you--
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Goddamit, Reilly--
What?
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
