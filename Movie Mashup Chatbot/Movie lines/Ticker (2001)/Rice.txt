Ain't that a shit--
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
Mike...
You okay?
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
What was it this time?
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
Next week we work the park.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
