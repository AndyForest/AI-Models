No thanks, Bev.
Damn.
How's the print coming?
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
Thanks.
-Where?
Officer Reilly, vice.
Where are they?
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Just do it.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
What... ?
Which one's which?
Yeah, another round thing.
Make up your mind, trigger.
What's wrong?
Something round, two wires ...
More metal... sharp edge...
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Keep talking.
Nothing.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Talk to me. Let's assess.
What do we do?
Fuck factor?
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Me, too.
Would you?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Where you guys at?
Be right back.
It's working.
I terrible with mechanical things.
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
What?
Which one's which?
So cut both.
Why do you do it?
You guys seem pretty tight.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
`Til we get a better lead.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Look, it's a longshot...
Yep.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
You mentioned something called Redstone.
I don't know. You tell me?
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Hey, look--
Where...?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Anything else I should know?
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Mike Reilly.
Now wait just a fucking-
What?
What was-? Why...?
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
What're you talking about?
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
Thanks.
What do you mean?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
You the Bomb Squad?
Then why tell me?
Thank you.
Taylor's dead.
Who is he?
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
You touch me again and--
A ticking bomb...
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
But sir--
I want to work this.
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
Insurance?
What kind of bomb was it?
Look, it's important.
It don't work-
Don't talk.
Yeah, just a nick ...
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
You don't fish.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
Look who's talking, old man.
Nice to be here.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
T.J., what're you doing?
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
A what?
Huh?
Captain assigned me to assist you.
What?
It's about this.
Reilly, Vice. I-
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
I know.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
I promised her she'd be safe.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
I didn't. But I had to try.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Report on the case so far.
Sir...
Yes, sir.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
I'll do it.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
I'll do it.
Sir, I--
Captain...
