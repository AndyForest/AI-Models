Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
Anyone?
A new friend?
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
The first.
I've even printed my own currency.
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Philistine.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
