I'm sure we will.
What is this?  A whole new train?
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
My God!  He's so excessive!
God in heaven, what is that?!
My hat is off to you, sir.
Of course not.
It was in your book.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
What?  President Grant is...!
My pleasure.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
I adjusted it.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Relax.  We're almost there.
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
It's a town!
Willard...
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
What's this?
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
It is?
Oh, damn!  That's it.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Know what this is?
You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
Thank you.
Can you fill me in here?
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Uh... how long ago was this?
So... what happened?
Well... that, too.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
Jim, are you all right?
That's right... That's good.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Hey, I tried the board.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
All that jumping and kicking.
What was all that back there?
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
Now, what was that?
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
Yes.  Now, observe....
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
My disguise.  And here...
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Limestone quarry?
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Aha!
I'll work on it.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
Try what?
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Always hoping.  Or this...
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Wouldn't dream of it.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
J. S. Bach.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
But it only has six legs.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
