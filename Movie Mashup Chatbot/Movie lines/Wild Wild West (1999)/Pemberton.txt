Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
He's not giving up?
He calls it the Tarantula.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Yes, me!
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
It is?
It's a smelting retort.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Yes!
