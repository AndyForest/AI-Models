They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
We'll see.
Fine, I'll stop.
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
My.  It's gotten longer.
She's perfectly safe.
You've... done... this... before.
Would that include me?
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
You most certainly do.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
My... the wild west.
Really?
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
