Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
In the next two minutes?
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
Where have you been?
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Thank you.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
There's only seventy-eight.
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
I know!  I know!
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
Oh, thank you.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
When we find him, he is mine.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
Not again.
And people are actually fooled by that?
What is that?
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
It's not a guy...
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
No record of him.
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
It's better than nothing.
This is good.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You might have mentioned you had that.
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
What way is that?
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
At least I tried something.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
I'm going to hit you.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
All what?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
You feeling all right?
Almost?
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
That's a lot of butler.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Prepare what?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
What about the explosive?
Starting with a screw?
Is this leading somewhere?
Aha?
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
You need that real often?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Put them all together and what do we have?
But don't pull that again.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Funny.  So am I.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Jim West.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
You bring the best out in a man.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
I've had some practice.
Oh, I would hope not.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
You tell me.
I don't like to lose, either.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Your guests, ma'am?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
My friend?
Private train?
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
And?
Nicely said, sir.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Good work.  Really.
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Easy now.
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
That would be... the Mexican War?
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
He had a pressing engagement.
You're not that big.
Dr. Loveless?
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
I deal with some tough customers.
No, sir... just a businessman.
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
I beg your pardon?
Now it's a bomb.
This is something.
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
Are you all right?
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
Who was this partner of his?
We'll explain on the way.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Dr. Pemberton?
Right.
You're not going to use it, are you?
In an hour they're gone!
When are they coming?
Well?
