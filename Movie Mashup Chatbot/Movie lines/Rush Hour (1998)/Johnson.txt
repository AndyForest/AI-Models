Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
You don't like it?

Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
It's called a dress.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find ï¿½em.
Jesus...what do you want?
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
They put you in charge?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
What's wrong with that?
No...what?
The Feds?!
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --

Where'd you get it?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
