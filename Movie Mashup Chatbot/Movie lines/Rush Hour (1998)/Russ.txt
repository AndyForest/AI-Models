And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Don't play bullshit games with me.
That's what you were supposed to be!
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Carter, shut up!
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
He is the situation.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
At this point we don't have much.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got ï¿½em.
Carter, can I have a moment?
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
