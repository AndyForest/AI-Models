I want to speak with my daughter!
Hello.
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
Yes.
Can I speak with her?
My daughter.
Yes.
Hello.
I do.
Yes.
Griffin?  Where are you.
Yes.
Hello.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I am so sorry about your men.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
He is very good.
I would like one of my people to help.
