Oh, I think you like this very much.
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my �hood.
What a surprise!
Oh my god. Griffin.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
The art.
Oh no.
What are you doing here?
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
I'm sorry.
Oh no, I dropped it.
Oh yes.
No, please, I don't --
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
I am from outa town.
What do you hear?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
Going into the restaurant.
It's him.
Excuse me?
Want some?
Are you OK?
Good God, ya'll!
Yee-aww.
Yes, I think so.
Who does not know War?  �War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.�
Yes, I know this song.
You want more?
That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.
You like it?
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Took off. Yes. They took off.
You talk too fast.
Stool pigeon.
Stooly.
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
No. I just made it up.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Did you make the plate?!
No.
What plate?
Shortcut?
What about them?
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
It was not my intent --
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Witnesses.
I was being polite.
What?
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
We are both full of shit.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
A little.
No.
Help me Rhonda.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
Beach Boy.
You talk very fast.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
I was trying to find the right time.
I still have work to do here.
