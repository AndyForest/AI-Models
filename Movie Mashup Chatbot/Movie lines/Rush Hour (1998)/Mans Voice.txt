The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
Shut up!
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
What is your name?
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
You have what I asked for?
It's Griffin.
Han?
