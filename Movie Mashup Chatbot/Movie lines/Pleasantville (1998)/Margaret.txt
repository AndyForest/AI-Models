I like calling you David.
You're gonna forget about me.
Where are they?
Can I open it?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
What do we do?
Real rain?
What's going on?
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
You want some berries?
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
What's that like?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
How?
Out there.
So what's it like?
You don't know?
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Oh ... Hi.
Keeps going ...
No. I baked them for you.
No. I baked them for you.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
That was sure swell ...
