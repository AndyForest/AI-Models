Thanks ... I love you.
... It's a pretty short trip.
I won't.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
Sure.
Wait.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Looks just like it did.
Have you got any make up?
It's okay. It's alright.
I'm fine.
Oh no ... I'm fine.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
It can't be possible.
We're in Pleasantville?
What'll it be?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
I don't believe it.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
But it could happen.
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
Oh sure it is.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Why am I out of order?
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
It's like the basketball team.
I think I've got something to say.
It was accessible to everyone.
Well--it was dark out ...
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Still doesn't make it right.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Yes I do.
Yes I did.
I thought the books were blank?
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
What?
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
What color is that hedge of yours?
Mr. Simpson ...
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
And you're sure about this?
You got the admissions letter.
Honestly ... no.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Are you sure?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
What?
Yes.
Wow.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
That's great.
... Yeah.
You're reading?
Nothing.
The pages filled in?
Sure.
It's fine.
It's okay.
Really? It seems so fattening.
They don't have that kind of potential.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
They're happy like this.
You have no right to do this.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
What did you do to him?
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Jen please ...
They don't notice that kind of thing.
He won't notice anyway.
It's in your closet.
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
Jen, listen ...
JENNIFER!
What were you doing in a library?
What?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
I don't think so.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
As a matter of fact he does.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
To who?
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Owns the hardware store.
We're supposed to be in school.
Just take deep breaths.
I don't believe this.
I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?
Oh God.
You--you gotta get us out of here.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Oh my God.
Get lost!
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
No way.
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
What are you doing?
I like it too.
No I won't. I swear.
I'm not sure.
Sure ...
It was a prop for the school play ...
We'll just put up the top.
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
Rain.
They just grow like that?
Hunh?
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Yeah.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
What?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
Mmmmgh.
Oh ... Right.
... Lover's Lane?
Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
Hi.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
Marmalade.
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
There's worse places.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
Why don't you just take me back without it?
Why?
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
I'm going to leave now.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
No you're not.
Why?
I didn't do anything wrong.
... Only if they mean it.
Look ...
I had nothing to do with that.
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
What do you mean?
Oh--well ...
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Re-runs?
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
I can't.
... Hi.
COME BACK!!!
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Where are you going ...
Don't get upset.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
My name's David.
Because we don't belong!
What the hell's going on!
How much does it cost?
Ooomph?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
McIntire's.
Yeah ...
... Like Prince Charming.
... Her father.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
It's beautiful.
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
What's wrong?
Open it.
It's an art book.
I brought you something ... From the library.
Hi.
Yeah.
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
... What's that?
So they can have their hamburgers!
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Forget about that!
Just listen to me ...
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Yeah ...
Yeah ...
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
Oh hi!
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Do you have the lettuce?
Listen to me!
What?
I understand.
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Yeah ...
What's wrong?
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
