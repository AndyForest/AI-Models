Where are you gonna go?
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
Sure you are.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
I was in a bowling-alley.
All night?
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Rain.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
No. Of course not.
Thank you very much.
... How?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
One of those ... big beds?
No. What?
"Changes."
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
