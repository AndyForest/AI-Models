It's better, Mary Sue.
With what?
Why not?
We were gonna ... You know ...
It's six-thirty ...
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
It is?
I think ... I might be ill ...
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
Sure is pretty.
Lover's Lane!
But where would we go?
What?
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
Oh yeah.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
She won't go out with me?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
What's the matter?
What?
