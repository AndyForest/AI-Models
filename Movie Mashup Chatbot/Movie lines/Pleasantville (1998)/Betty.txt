Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Yes.
Ah.
No. I want to know.
What?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Can I ask you a question?
Mary Sue?
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
I love you too.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I had to say goodbye.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Thank you.
What?
And they won't be able to tell?
Does it look okay?
In my handbag.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Like a drum.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
But I really should get home.
What is that?
No ...
I've got to go ...
Yes she is.
She's crying.
She's crying.
Bud?
Where'd you get this?
I think it looks nice.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
I'm sorry ...
Hello Bill.
I'm gonna go now.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
No I'm not sweetie.
I don't want it to go away.
I don't want to put on some make up ...
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
No I'm not.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I told you where I was.
Oh, George ...
Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
How was your day?
