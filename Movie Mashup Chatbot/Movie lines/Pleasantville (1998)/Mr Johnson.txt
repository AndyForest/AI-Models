Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
Yeah. It does.
But you can't go out there.
You can't go out there.
I don't know.
It's alright. Let me see.
It's alright.
Wait ...
No she's not.
What?
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
Here's my favorite.
Bud brought it to me.
Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
Having kind of a tough time.
Thanks.
No, no ... Come on in.
Oh, hi ...
Oh, hello Betty.
Just a little--You know.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
No, that's not it.
I'll never be able to do that.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
Aren't you a little early?
Oh, hi.
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
Really?
Well don't you?
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Christmastime.
You know what I really like?
Why?
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Bud ...
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Yes.
... Yeah.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
I'm so glad you're here.
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
Oh.
Bud?
