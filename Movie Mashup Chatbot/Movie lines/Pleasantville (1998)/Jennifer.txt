What?
Okay.
You sure you want to know this?
... Sex.
It doesn't matter.
Yeah ...  That--and ...
What do you mean?
Sure.
Yeah?
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Thanks.
I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
Don't! Just let go.
I'm busy.
Oh.  I can't.
So.
What are you doing?
Trust me ...
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
... Why?
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
... Lover's Lane.
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
You want to get out of here?
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
Oh, gosh no.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Um ... It's ...
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Right here.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
I told you. I'm like positive.
What?
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Can I ask you a question?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
No. She really liked you.
Yeah ...
Sure.
So what is it?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
Nothing?
What's wrong?
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
Not directly anyhow ...
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Me too. Sounds swell.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
Well if I don't who will?
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Nothing.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
So what's the point?
What do you mean?
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
I could like kill a guy with these things.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
No way.
Can we do any better?
Those are my friends.
Hunh.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Who's that?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Play along?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
You know him?
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
I still don't see why we're doing this.
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Neither do I.
What's going to happen?
Noooooo!
Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
What did you do?
What happened?
YOU get lost!
God, David. Just give it to me!
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
Lemme see that.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Pleasantville Marathon?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
What are you doing?
Oh GOD ...
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
What happened?
Free?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Yeah ...
TV repair?
Cool.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Hey.
