Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
Much less than that.  An hour and a half.
How long do you think you've been here?
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
Just gimme the damn remote!
Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
Because you're coming home.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
Hope you're proud of yourself.
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
OW!
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
EXCUSE ME?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Oh no? Let me show you something!
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
NOW!
I want a word with you ...
BUD.
Excuse me?
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
What?
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
Well c'mere, young fella.
Hello there.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
Why would I do that?
Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
That's right.
McGinty's.
What department store did they go to?
Nice ... Nice ...
Right. And how did she dress him?
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
We'll get you fixed up in no time.
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.
Dream come true, hunh?
A miracle.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
What's the rush?
Well here I am.
Yeah. TV busted?
TV repair.
