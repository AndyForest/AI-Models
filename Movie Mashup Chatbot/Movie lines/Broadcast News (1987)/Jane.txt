I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
I'm going to take it.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
Yes.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Why not try it for a few weeks?
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Don't say anything about anything.
Sit down, stop.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
How?
I think you're the Devil.
This isn't friendship.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
What?
This is important to me.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
I have to be somewhere.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Aaron, will you tell me?
Then what was good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
Do you feel good about it?
Did it really go well?
No.
How'd it go?
You too.
Okay, great -- good luck.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
As good as humanly possible.
It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Did you bring your grey suit?
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Yes.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Well, whatever you think.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
I write for you sometimes.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Of course.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
Nine seconds.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
Call if you get weird.
Good night.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Sure.
Why do you say that?
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
A half hour in the lobby.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
But thanks.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
Yes.
It's started.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
Yes?
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
I'll never tell.
Yes, there is.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
Bobbie, please.
Right there, Bobbie.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Just a two-second dissolve.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Let me hear it!
Play back the last line...
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
Fill for a second.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
It's not opinion.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
It's better when you let me say it.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
It's okay.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
I knew what you meant.
I don't wan to discuss work.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
You fucking...
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
How can you say that to me?
That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
What?
No.  Did he really?
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
Good night??!
Yes.
Uh-huh.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Hi.  It's me.
Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
What happened?
No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
This is hysterical.
At least kiss me when you do that.
Well...
Great.
Uh-uh.
Good.  That's it...See you.
Who?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
So you like me, huh?
Oh, good.
Uh-huh.
Why, you need me for the story?
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Well, what is it?
What?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
I'll be the judge of that.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Okay.
Yeah?
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
Nervous?
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
What do you mean clean?
Billion.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
Yes.
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
How's it going?
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
Hey?
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
I trust you.
How are you at back rubs?
So great -- right?
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
If we could just eat first.
I like "godsend."
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Hi.
Right back to you.
I can't be.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Go ahead -- what?
