Ravenous homosexual.
I don't like the word gay.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
...good-bye then.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Anchor?
Is everything all right?
Okay.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
I wish it were you giving the story.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
One's enough.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Bad manners.
You talked me into it.
How do I get out of here?
They're not really going to call security are they?
