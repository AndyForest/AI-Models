Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Go ahead.
Why so glum?
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
