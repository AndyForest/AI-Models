I DON'T KNOW!
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
...What are they doin' right now...?
What?
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
Security's locking down the elevators.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
What'd you say?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
What!?
Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
Why?
What are we talkin' on the split...
