And who has access to that floor?
Is your security team armed?
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
You have a butler working that floor?
What kind of personnel?
-- so you shut them off?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
