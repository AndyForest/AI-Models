Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
How are we on time...?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Yeah... Sid?
No shit.
Shoot.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Wow.

Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.

Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Yeah... Sid?
