You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Two of 'em?
But there were more of you?
And this is your car, isn't it?
And threw us into the lake.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Then what --
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Yeah, we've been through that.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
What happened?
