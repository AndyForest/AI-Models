I'm here, where's the car?
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor, I'm a physician, be honest, or be dead within a day... s'your choice.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
I've got concerns.
Yeah, why.
