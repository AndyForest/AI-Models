Yeah.
Mortal.
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
Maroon uniforms?
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.

Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.

Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
And a very bad gamble.
Maybe.
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
