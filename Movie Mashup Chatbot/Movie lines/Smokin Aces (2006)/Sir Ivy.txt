FUCK YOU!
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
What were you doin' here anyway?
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
That takes some of the sting out.
True?
For real?
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
-- never in a million girl --
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
