Bag this fucker Buzzy.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
So how we lookin'?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
None whatsoever.
A million flat.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Yeah, I can front this.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
You got clicks, anything?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
