Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Taken care of.
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Should we knock?
What?
You've made your point.
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
What was the fight about?
May we come in?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
I know.  I can feel it too.
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Kalarjian?
I wasn't worried about us.
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Stop it, don't move him!
You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Whoa, nine months?
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Who is this guy, anyway?
I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
Hold on.
I'm not following you --
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
I tried calling last night but your father --
You mean Alex Browning.
Like what?
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Tell me again how it started.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
What's going on here?
