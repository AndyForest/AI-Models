Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
