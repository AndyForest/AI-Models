Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
That lucky bastard.
Yeah, so what happened?
But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Can I ask you a question?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
