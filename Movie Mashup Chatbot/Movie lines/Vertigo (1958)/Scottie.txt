I -- I --
Why did she never tell her daughter?
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
And when she goes to those places...
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
But you knew about this.
There are things you didn't tell me.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Ernie's.
How can I see her, to know her?
It's not my line.
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
Well?
Where'd she go?
How often does this happen?
No.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
No.
From whom?
Then?
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
No, I'm all right.
Like all this.
And you like it.
How long have you been back?
You don't have to do it for a living.
Interesting business.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
Hello?
She... went into the Bay.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Hello.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
I loved you, Madeleine.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
I made it.
We'll find him.
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
We're going up the tower.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
I need you.
Madeleine died here.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
To complete my cure.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Oh, yeah. There.
How does it work?
All in good time.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
No, Ernie's is fine.
That's what I had in mind.
Come here.
Mmmm.
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Wherever you'd like...
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Yes.
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
The color of your hair...
Yes. Yes, I do.
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
You can.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
Judy --
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
They're none of them right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
No, it's not right.
I want to! Come on!
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Will you, Judy?
Please! And don't look at me.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
No.
Yes.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
No.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
I'll take care of you.
Don't go.
Tomorrow morning.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Okay.
An hour?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Just dinner.
Then will you for me?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Will you have dinner with me?
I want to know who you are.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
But you haven't lived here long.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
Who you are --
Your name. And --
You won't have to.
Let me come in.
You're not far wrong.
You.
Just let me talk to you.
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
Why?
I won't lose you.
Yes.
Madeleine!!
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Madeleine --
Where?
Why?
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
No... we're together...
My love... because I love you.
Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
And it's a all real.
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
You've been there before. You've seen it.
It's all there. It's no dream.
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Go on.
Tell me.
Yes --
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Where's your husband?
Only this far.
Why? What's happened?
All the time.
I'm here, I've got you...
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
No!
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
What else?
There's a name on the gravestone.
How do you know?
Where?
What else?
Would you know the room?
What do you remember?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
Yesterday.
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
Home?
What?!
What was it inside that told you to jump?
Why did you jump?
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
Where?
Where were you born?
When?
Have you been here before?
Where?
Where are you now?
Madeleine!
Would you like a drink of water?
No birds live here.
Only silence. It's always like this.
Why?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
What are you thinking?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
How can you be sure?
Do you know where you're going?
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Shopping?
Good-bye.
Meet again, sometime.
I hope we will, too.
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
Would you like some coffee?
-- talking to you...
Not at all, I enjoyed --
You've nothing to apologize for.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
Some people prefer it.
Wander about.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
My name is John Ferguson.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
I... didn't know where you lived.
Oh! Yes! Here!
No.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
Wandering about.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Please drink your coffee.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
This afternoon.
Where had you been before?
Why?
Where were you?
Do you remember where you were?
You don't remember.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
Her car is gone.
Would you please go and look?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
How long has she had the room?
Carlotta Valdes?
What is her name?
Please answer my question.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh?
What is it, a still life?
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Wandering.
Naturally.
What I've been doing?
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Yeah.
Mm. Better.
Around.
Just wander.
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Midge!
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Carlotta?
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Out!
Out. I've got things to do.
I've told you enough.
Here you are.
I'll take you home.
Nothing to tell.
For what?
And she died...
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
Do you know him well?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Who?
Yeah.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Okay.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
I think I can lick it.
My... the acrophobia.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.
Could be.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Well?
How's your love life, Midge?
What a pleasant hobby.
Uh-huh!
I've never run across one like that.
From that music.
I'm having one now.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
I know. Everybody tells me.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I had to quit, Midge.
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
What do you mean?
How do you know? Personal experience?
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Ow!!
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
How?
By whom?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out.
Can we have it by tonight?
How soon can it be altered?
Yes! That's it!
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
