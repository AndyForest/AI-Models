Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Let me go into the church alone.
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
You believe that I love you?
Let me go! Let me go!!
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Please let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Let me go.
You can't.
Too late... there's something I must do...
I love you too... too late... too late...
Yes.
Here with you.
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
No, never!
Yes?! But --
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
No, don't go away!
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
No.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
I know.
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
A grave...
No... it's in shadow.
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
Vaguely...
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
...somewhere in the light.
Take me away from here?
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
No, I can't tell you!
No!
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No, don't ask me!
No!... No!
Long ago...
Yes...
The tall trees...
Here with you.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
No, thank you.
No.
And no birds sing.
Do you hear anything?
Knowing I have to die...
I don't like them.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
The oldest living things?
How old?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
No.
I don't know.
Good-bye.
We have.
What?
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
No! No, thank you!
I enjoyed talking to you.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
What?
No... it's wrong.
One shouldn't live alone.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
You like it, too.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Oh... wandering about.
When?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
At...
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
No...
Why am I here? What happened?
