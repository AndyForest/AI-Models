What car?
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
Oh, yes!
Is there something I can do for you?
