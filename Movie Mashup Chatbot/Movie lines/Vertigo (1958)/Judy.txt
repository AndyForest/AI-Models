Love me... keep me safe...
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
What are you going to do?
Some money.
What are you going to do?
I don't know... Switzerland?
Your accident...
Yes!
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Yes!
Scottie, please...!
You can't. You're afraid!
No! Let me go!
No!
Take me away...
Scottie --
I'm scared.
Why?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
But why? Why here?
Scottie, why are we here?
Where are you going?
No, it's all right.
We're going awfully far.
Can't you see?
Scottie!
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
Too late. I've got my face on.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Is that the best you can do?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
Ernie's?
Where shall we go for dinner?
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Well?
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Ah, no!
You don't even want to touch me.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go...
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
I don't like it!
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
You want me to dress like her?
But why?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Scottie, what are you doing?
But I like that one, Scottie.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Honest?
Yes --
I like that one.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
Why?!
That's not very complimentary, either.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
No? Then what?
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Tomorrow night? Well --
Thank you again. Good-night.
Mmm.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Because I remind you of her?
Dinner... and what else?
No, you don't owe me anything.
Why?
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Salina, Kansas!
I told you! Right here!
About three years.
It's a place to live, that's all.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
Judy Barton.
What do you want to know?
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
Why?
What about?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Do you live here in the hotel?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
What for? Who are you?
