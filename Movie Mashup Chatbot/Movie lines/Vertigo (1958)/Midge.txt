I'll give you another complication: he still is.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
He won't talk.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
No, not exactly. Want to see?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
What have you been doing?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Oh... this and that.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Oh?
Did you need it?
Oh?
Where?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Bye-bye!
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Is she pretty?
Think?  Well, what do you think?
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
You haven't told me everything.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
The poor thing....
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Pop Leibel.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Johnny!
Easy, now.
Step number two.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
That!?!
How?
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
What.
Sorry, old man. Work.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
Three whole weeks.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Normal.
That's following a train of thought.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Oh!
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Well?... what'll you do?
Ah, Johnny-O...
It's where you belong.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
It wasn't your fault.
Why?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
More than you think.
What's tomorrow?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
