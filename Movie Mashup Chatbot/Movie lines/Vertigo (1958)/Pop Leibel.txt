By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
She died.
By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
