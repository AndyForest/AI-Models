He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
