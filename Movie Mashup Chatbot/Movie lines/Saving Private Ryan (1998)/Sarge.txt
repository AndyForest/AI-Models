Yes, sir.
Uh, oh.
What are we going to do?
What do you think?
Yes, sir.
You're welcome, John.
I'll do my best.
I know.
Just what I want to do.
You want me to take over?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
And how do you bluff yourself?
Oh, yeah?
And what about your own hand?
Bits and pieces.
Yeah.
Vecchio.
You alright?
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
How about...?
How about I go right, sir?
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
Is it getting worse?
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
Yup, hell of a mission.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
You're kidding yourself.
Three for three.
Nope.
And what about you?
You think they'll be alright?
Good news?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
Uh, Captain...
Uh, Captain...
Hell of a mission.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
You get a translator, Captain?
Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
Fresh out.
Beasley's dead.
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
What about the company?
You?  Leading a squad?
Caen?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Damn fool.  Sir.
What are we likely to run into?
Yeah?  So?
Frogs?
Who cares?
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
