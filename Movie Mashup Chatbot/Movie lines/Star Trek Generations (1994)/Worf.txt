Aye, sir.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
Aye, sir.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
There are no other ships in the system.
The royal...studs?
