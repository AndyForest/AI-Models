That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
Data, are you all right?
Data, this isn't the time.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Thanks.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
What?
You get what?
Really? What do you feel?
Well?
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
No, I didn't know that.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
No.
I was ordered to by the Captain.
What do you want?
What's normal?
