You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
On screen.
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
Can you locate them?

It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
We don't have a tractor beam.
Please, I insist.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Please, please.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
