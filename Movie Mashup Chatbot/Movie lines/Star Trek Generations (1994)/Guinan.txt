I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
Yes, where would you go?
Why would you want to leave?
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Wherever he wanted to be.
All of us.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
You're in the Nexus.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
