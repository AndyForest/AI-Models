I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
So why did you come here?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
Did Teddy send you?
Are you Teddy?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
My boyfriend told me about you.
You're the memory guy?
You tell me.
Well, that's me.
What are you here for?
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
What do you want?
What?
Sweet.
On the house.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
Why not?
Can I ask you something?
About your whore of a wife?
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Help me.
Don't protect him.
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
No!
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Calls himself Dodd.
Somebody's come. Already.
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
I told him about your car.
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
Yeah?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
And?
What are you gonna do?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
His name was Jimmy.
Just relax.
Your wife?
Such as?
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
Kill him.
Did you?
Yes.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Sleep okay?
You know what we have in common?
They treating you alright?
I wasn't helping you for money.
It's isolated.
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Tell me about her again.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Yes.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
Is that what your little note says?
Yeah.
You told me.
You did explain, Lenny.
You don't remember me.
