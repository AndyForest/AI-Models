You should go.
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
What do you want to do?
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
Letty, please.
Yeah, the plans.
I sure know what that feels like.
I guess so.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
Silly, silly, silly.
Silly?   Silly am I?
Why'd you tell?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Always the drugs.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
How about a dance?
Something like that.
Aunt Lily?
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
How may I help you?
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Coming.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
I couldn't even face that one.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
I think I should go home.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
The store was busy.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Sounds grim.
This must be Beast.
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
You've got one hell of a great body.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
You, too. Kick ass today.
I'll see you tonight.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
Shhhh.
No.
Hey.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
Really?
Do you like it?
You've got to see the kitchen first.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
You like it?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
Where to?
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
I better make a list.
No, I need some serious household advice.
So, it's over?
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Not a one.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Home free.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
I do.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
It's a good thing my family loves you.
Then it's over.
Tell the doctor.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
That's where I always go when I get out.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
I wish I could have seen that.
Shocking, huh?
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
What's my rap?
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
A rose is a rose.
A daisy for the lady.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
No rounds for another three hours.
Exactly.
No.
A small price.
For a price.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Guess.
Guess which hand.
It's magic.
So are you engaged, or what?
Very romantic setting.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
What are you looking to read?
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
Don't take it personally.
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
That must be really difficult.
What if it's got a pattern?
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
Yes?   Go right ahead.
What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
Terrific.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
How's it look?
I'll float you.
