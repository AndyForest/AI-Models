Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
You did the right thing.

Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
It'll be fine.
What's all the dreck?
What's the matter?
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
How can I help?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.

What about the engagement party?

What do you think of this one?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
And the party?
Really?
Please, Letty.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
How?
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
There's nothing to tell.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
