Don't be fresh.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
Honestly, Letty.
Not even if it's something positive?
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Must you walk so quickly?
I'm only looking out for you.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
When did you start smoking?
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
I'll see you soon.
Paul said he'd call the school.  And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
Ruth's already taken him home.
Yes.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
I gather he's late as usual.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Tell us every detail.
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Are you sure, Dear?
Will you get time off to do that?
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
