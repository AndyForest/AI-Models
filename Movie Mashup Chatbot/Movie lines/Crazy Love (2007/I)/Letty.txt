I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
What?
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I miss Beast a lot, too.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
Do we have to talk about this?
I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
I want to see my mother immediately.
What kind of place is this?
What?
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Yeah, and a dimple.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
I did this already.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
I can't.    I can't see him there.
But what am I going to do?
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
I ruined your wedding night.
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
I didn't say...
Do we have to talk wedding details?
Ecru.
You're slowing.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
Fuck me.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
Do you think I should?
Hi, Mom.
Truly.
You look beautiful.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Yeah, everything's under control.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
I'd have to see it on.
She said she'd be here at 10.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Maybe.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
Just go ahead and tell us.
What's up with you?
Just remember that I love him.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
A deal's a deal.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
I've already made arrangements.
It's good exercise, Mom.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
Mom, please.
I haven't had a crush since I was
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Which flowers did you order?
You too, Mom.
Tomorrow?
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
Mom, please.
Oh no.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Wow.   Congratulations.
Come on.
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
I guess so. I think that's right.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
Lie?
Mottled really.   Green and red.
It had this red spot on its back.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
There's a spider in my room.
I'm really not that hungry.
I guess I should go now.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
I love you so much.
I know I don't want to lose you.     I don't think I could stand it.
What are we going to do?
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
Well then why'd it happen?
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
And all the plans we have.
It's hard to know where to start.
I guess we need to talk.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I think I should call someone.
Michael, take it easy.
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
What?
What is it? Are you OK?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Bingo.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Congratulations.
I got worried. Are you OK?
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
The restaurant, too?
Are you OK?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
You got wine. That's great.
Steak?
Promise?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Yeah.    How was the job search?
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Thanks.
Yeah?
Good luck.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Not yet.
Michael.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
It's sex time.
You're so wrong.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
I love your apartment.
Let's try out the bed.
It's TV heaven.
Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
I love the pillows.
Wow.
Open up.    I want to see.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Aren't you ever quiet?
List schmist. You'll remember.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Furnished?
All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
Yeah.
Just checking.
And did you go to the mission?
So there were no problems?
Tell me all.
Well?
Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
But I do.     I love you, too.
Michael, I...
Do you?
Your family just met me.
Lie down.
I don't like lamb.
I have a terrible confession.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
What else would you do?
No way.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Break up?    They wish.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
What are the delusions like?
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Really?    Me too.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Don't be ridiculous.
We'll get caught.
We're supposed to be asleep.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Good God.
Really, this isn't funny.
The left one.
Enough with the abracadabra.
What have you done with the ring?
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
He asked me to marry him.
Paul.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
I wasn't hungry.
But you're checking it out.
Anything interesting.
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Who do you think you are?
You took bets on my diagnosis?
A while, I guess.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
By color.
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
No.
Chair, cup and ball.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
I answered these questions last night.
Letty.
Sure, I understand.
I'm really sorry.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
Michael.   Yes.
What?
Getting back.
I start on Monday.
Oh.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Here's the ring.
I love him.
He's a patient here.
No.
It doesn't matter who.
I've met someone else.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
No...
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
No, no.
No, you've done a perfect job.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Especially now.
No.
Yes, I suppose so.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
Something you did?
That's a big question.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
I'm going to the store.
Can you loan me a 20?
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
Yeah.
I don't think so.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
No, it's not like that.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
I don't feel like going to work today.
I'm calling in sick.
Sure. Of course.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
I mean tonight.
Yeah?
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Office work?
What does that mean?
I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
