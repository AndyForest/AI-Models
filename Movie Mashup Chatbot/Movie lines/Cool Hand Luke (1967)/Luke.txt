Gotta go, Arletta.
That's good: he earned it.
Yeah.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Here, Mom.
Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Yeah.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
Yeah. Well.  Gettin' up here, Boss.
How'd you find me?
Yes, Boss.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
Don't hit me! Please, for God's sake, don't hit me.
Please! Please!
I... I... I...
I don't know, Boss.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
Comin' out here, Boss?
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Here, Captain.
Like I always do?
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
On my own.
Take it easy, Drag.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Like an elephant.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
We got it locked in the sock.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Fifty's a nice round number.
That's it. That's the end.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Innocent?
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
I just always did like truck rides.
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
A Lucas Jackson.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Kick a buck.
Kick a buck.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
