Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
Buck is a deal.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
You don't take another man's place, boy.
He's gonna be awright.
A cold drink? Okay?
A cold drink.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Oh lookit that brunette.
Lemme see it!
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
What happened? How far did you get?
But there's still daylight left.
I call.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
Pair'a nines.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Tramp! Beautiful!
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
Cuter.
Cuter again.
I'm in.
Cuter.
Man, it's so hot.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
But -- but --
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
Well, how far didya get?
Back a buck.
Damn.
Man Oh Man.
You phony creep!
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
What are you talking about?
How about you tryin' to make me?
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
