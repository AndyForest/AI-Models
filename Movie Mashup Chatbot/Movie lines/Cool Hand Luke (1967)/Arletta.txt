Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
No.
What went wrong?
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
What are you doin' here?
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
