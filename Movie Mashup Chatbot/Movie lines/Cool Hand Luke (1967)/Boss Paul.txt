Cut that backsass!
Git movin', I said.
Git your shovel and git to work.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Go git it, Luke.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
You got your mind right, Luke?
Git to work!
What's all this dirt in the yard?
You don't know!
Then how come it ain't done yet?
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
Here's the Patrol.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
