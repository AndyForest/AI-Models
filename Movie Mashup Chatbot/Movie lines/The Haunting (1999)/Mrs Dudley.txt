No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
So far.
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
