Nell!
Was sure she'd be in here.
Nell --
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Maybe someday.
Yeah.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
No.
You could have.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
Luke.
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
But the experiment was a failure.
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Oh God, we can't get out!
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
She needs help.
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
How could you do this to people?
It's okay... we're all here...
Maybe they're Mary's.
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
When do we take the tests?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Then let's go get you one.
What'd you come back for, babe?
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
I do.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Nell, what happened?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
Okay.
Are you sure?
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
I have a loft.
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
Well?
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
That's so sad.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
Maybe you did it yourself.
Is it over?
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
David.
Watts?
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
No.  The world has missed you.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
You're okay.
Jeez.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
That depends.
What do you do?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
What did it cost?
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
