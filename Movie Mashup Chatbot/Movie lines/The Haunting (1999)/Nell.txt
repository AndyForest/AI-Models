Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
I only saw Theo drive up.
Well, I... uh...
Uh... Nell Vance...
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
No --
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
Then who called me?
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
Why?
Sure.
Welcome Home.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
Are you coming to confess?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I got more scared.
Yes.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
It was very specific.
That smell... oh, God.
Sorry.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
All the carvings.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Why?
Yes.
Why?
Who?
Is there something about the house?
Why do you need a chain like that?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Oh!  You scared me.
No one will come any nearer than that.
Why would we --
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
Mrs. Dudley.
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Just had to be sure.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
I don't think I want any.
-- but the painting!
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
-- What do you think?
I think so.
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
I don't know, you know...
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Red.  What else?
I've never had a pedicure before.
I don't know what to think anymore.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Why?
Theo... Did you?
No, it's getting worse.
David?
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
What's his first name?
How could he have left without his keys?
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Good night, Theo.
Yes.  I've missed it.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
I know.
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
No.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Not really.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
That's why we're here.
I don't know what you mean.
It's all I could afford.
Fifteen dollars.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
