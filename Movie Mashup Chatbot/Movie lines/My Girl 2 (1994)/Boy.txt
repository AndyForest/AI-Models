Don't mention it.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Your Uncle Phil told me.
You're Vada right?
Excuse me I asked you a question.
