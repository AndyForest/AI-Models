She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
I'd say you turned out just fine.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
I've got something better.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
I'll try.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
nan
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
I'm glad you're here.
Does she?
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
Sure am, who are you?
