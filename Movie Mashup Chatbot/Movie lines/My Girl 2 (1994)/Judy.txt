So she had you in jail, in Russia?

Hi.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
He likes you.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
My mother can't have any more kids.
I know that.
That's okay.
Hi.
