NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
Those lying motherfuckers!
What chip?
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
John, get out of the way!!
Ready.
Go!  I'll finish here.
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
I love you, John.  I always have.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
We're better off by ourselves.
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Out of the way, John!
Kyle, don't go!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
I know!
They took him from me.
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
Are you afraid?
It's finally over.
Is it safe for them here?
Can you get us in there, past security?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Why attack Russia?
And Skynet fights back.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Then what?
Why him?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
You look like handmade shit.
Can it be destroyed?
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
