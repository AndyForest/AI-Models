Let me try mine.
No one must follow your work.
Now listen to me very carefully.
Do you have bandages?
It must end here... or I am the future.
I have to go away, John.
I'm sorry, John.
Yes.  Throw it in.
Terminated.
We don't have much time.
Drive for a minute.
Trust me.
I'll deal with the police.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
This is tactically dangerous.
Dyson.
She intends to change the future somehow.
No problemo.
No.
Pain causes it?
Why do you cry?
You will.
Torque wrench please.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
No.
Excellent.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Smile?
No problemo.
Chill out, dickwad.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Affirmative.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
Everything.
What?
Right.
Why?
Why?
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
That is one of my mission parameters.
You told me to.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
I would.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Liquid metal.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
My mission is to protect you.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Yes.
No.  There is another chip.
Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
I must be destroyed.
The CPU from the first terminator.
I have detailed files.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
No.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Correct.
So do you.
Unknown.
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
