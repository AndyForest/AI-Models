I order you not to!
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
No!
Will it melt in there?
Is it dead?
What?
Where you going?!
Remember what I said, you can't...
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Drive faster.
Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
Alriight!!  My man!
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Not even of dying?
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
Does it hurt?
Cool.
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
Swear.
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Prove it... stand on one foot.
You have to do what I say?!
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Max.
You sure?
Can I stop by my house?
Where we going?
Radical.
What does that mean?
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
No way!
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Easy money!
Gimme that Phillips right there.
SHOOT!!!!
Ready to rock?
I got it.  Piece of cake.
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
I know, Mom.  I know.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
Uh huh.
Mom?  You okay?
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Alright, it!  We need it!
No!  Don't kill him!
