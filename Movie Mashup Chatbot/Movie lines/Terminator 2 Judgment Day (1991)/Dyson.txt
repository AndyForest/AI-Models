That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
I can't
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
We should abort.
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
Do you know about the chip?
Please... let... the kids... go...
No good.
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
My God.
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
