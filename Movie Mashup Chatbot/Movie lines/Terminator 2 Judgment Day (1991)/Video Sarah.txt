You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
