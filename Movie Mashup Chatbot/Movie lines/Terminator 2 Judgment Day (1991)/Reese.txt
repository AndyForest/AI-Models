There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
I love you.  I always will.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
