But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
You going to work all day?
