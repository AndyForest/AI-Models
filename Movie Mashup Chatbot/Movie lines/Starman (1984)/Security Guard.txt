Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?

Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Is there a reward in this?
