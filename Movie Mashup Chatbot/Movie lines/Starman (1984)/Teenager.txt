I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Fly.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
They after you?
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
In the cars, too?!
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
My grandmother's rich.
