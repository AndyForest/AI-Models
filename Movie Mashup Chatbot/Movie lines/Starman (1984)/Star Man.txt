Thank you.
It is beautiful.
No.
No.
Eh... yes.
I make maps.
I understand.
Goodbye.
Tell the baby about me.
No.
I love you.
What do I do now?
I must go.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I will wave to you.
The yellow one.
There.
No, thank you.
Many, many days and nights...
You want the baby to laugh at me.
If you want to keep it, you can.
I will say that we can be friends.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I understand.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Yes.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I know how to gamble now.
I understand.  Thank you.
I want to gamble.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
They are beautiful.
I gave you a baby last night.
I understand.
Do they talk?!
No.
Horses.
What?
I do not get cold.
You are cold.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
You can stop. I will go on alone.
You promised.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I can't stay on this planet.
The cook.
Asshole!!
I feel better if I move.
I must meet my ship.
I don't want you to be hurt.
I will go. But not you.
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
Are you angry at me?
You can have one.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
On the radio they say it's good.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
You liked my singing?
I am not a good singer.
I do not want to.
Yes.
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
I like this music.
Why?
I am your friend.
Are you my friend?
He will.
What is hell?
I understand.
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I don't understand 'friend.'
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
Yes?
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
It was a mistake.
I was afraid.
What?
Please stay.
Jennyhaydn.
Goodbye.
Go?
Yes.
Can I have the gun?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
The car will stop?
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
Yes.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
I do not speak English.
But I speak English.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
What is hitchhike?
But I must go here.
Why?
Why?
Do you have a baby?
A baby is a new person?
Is that a baby?
When we get here.
No.
No.
No.
I need you.
Three nights... two days.
Yes. Day... night.
Yes.
I do not understand.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
I will see it next time.
It was yellow.
What?
Horses.
Shit!
I want to try it.
I...
What is...  ...Coke?
What?
Money.
No.
You. Mouth closed.
No.
Who?
Shit... shit... what shit?
Shit?
I am husband?
Who?
No gas.
Gas.
Space?
From?
I am...
Jennyhaydn.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
What?
Closed?
Go.
Gas good?
No gas.
Minneapolis... good.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
What?!
Smile... good?
What?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Money.
What?
Pancakes.
What?
What?
What?
That way.
Good.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Police...
What?!
Dashboard.
Gear shift.
Steering wheel.
What.
Ah no.
What.
Please...
Please.
Please...
No.
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
