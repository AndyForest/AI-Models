Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Recognize this?
Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
What?
No deal.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
No, we don't.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
You're not hearing me.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
Shermin...
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
Oh shit!!!
Clarify that.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
It's in a green Mustang?
When can we expect containment?
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
Contain it and get back to me.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Watch it. They're coming out.
Okay...
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
This is George Fox...
Mrs. Haydn...
