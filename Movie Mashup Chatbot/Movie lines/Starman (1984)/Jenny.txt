Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Credit card.
I'll take that.
You have one with two beds?
How much are your rooms?
Thank you.
Where's that?
What was your last stop?
Where did you stop last?
Where did you stop last?
No!!! No!!!
I won't let anyone hurt you.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
I will.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
Well...
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Where?
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
How long will it take you to get home?
Yes.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
I'd like to...
This is yours...
We can.
What will you say about us?
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
The cook again?
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
What for?
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
But...
Yes, they are.
Oh, you're pretty...
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
You don't forget anything, do you?
Good morning.
Nothing.
You're damn right I am.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
What are you saying?
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
No one's traveling in this weather.
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
Where did you learn that?
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Where are you going?
Come on.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
No. Get in.
Hurry up.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
Put that back.
Yes. Sing some more.
That was beautiful.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
Do you have music up there?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
Yes.
What are you doing?
It's bad.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
The captain...
Yes.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
You thought we were a different planet?!
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
What happened?
It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
Goodbye.
Yes?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
No.
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Then don't be smart.
You want this ticket?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
The driver will...
Say it.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
No... The closest...
Eh... yes...
Yes.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Sun...
How will I do this one?...
When do you have to be here?
Why are you going here? What is here?
You better.
You didn't even see it.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
Music.
Horses.
What's the matter?
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
You want to try it?
A drink.
Candy.
Yes.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Okay.
In your pocket, please...
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Shit.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
My... husband.
I know.
Closed.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
Are you from up there? Space?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
Who are you?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
You'll see.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Yes. Very good.
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
This car runs on gas.
No gas.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
What are you doing?
Minneapolis.
Yes.
Smile.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Money.
X...
Pancakes.
Coupons.
Flashlight.
Which way?
Good.
Eh... police.
Dashboard.
Gear shift.
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel...
Ah... no...
What?
Which way do you want to go?
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
Don't... don't do this... please...
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Help me!!!
Call the police!!
He's kidnapping me!!!
Help me!!
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Sure.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
What? No, of course not.
I don't know where he is.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Slow down, slow down.
You sure this is your car?
