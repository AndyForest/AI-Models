They must have picked it up in space.
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
You have no conception of this, do you?
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
It was a man though... right?
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Yes.
Twenty-eight years.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
We better get it into the box. Come on...
I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
No, sir. Radar.
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
Wait'll you see it.
No.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Very beautiful country up here...
