This is so silly.
But, Chip...
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
CHIP!!
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies.
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Chip, honey?
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Oh, honey!
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast.
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Ooohhhh!
Oooohhhh.
Oohhhh, Eugene!
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
We can be real quiet...
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Don't I get a kiss?
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli...
Chip, your ride is here.
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
That's nice.
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
...People who don't mind their own business.
Yes, I did.
What a mess.
I know Dottie!
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
So you admit you just lied?
So you do drink?
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
Are those pussy-willows?
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
COCKSUCKER!
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
I beg your pardon?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
You got your wish.
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
We all have bad nights.
And who may I ask is Carl?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing...
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Who wants fruit salad?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Certainly not!
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
He's a good boy.
Bon Appetit!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Right here!
Murder, honey.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
Yes you are.
You forgot something...
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
