Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
There is one big problem though.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Mrs... Sutphin?
