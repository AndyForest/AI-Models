Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
You said you hated him.
Hi!
He's really cute!
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
Hi, Hank.
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
You've been working in that video shop too long.
He goes to college with me!
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Watch the booth! I'll be back!
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
It's him!
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
He killed people, Mom.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
It's sugarless.
I do, please.
