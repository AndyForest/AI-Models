No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Yes... but... I didn't...
Yes, but I lent it...
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
...Browsing.
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
That's like your car, Beverly,
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
Beverly, are you alright?
I'll take this instead.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods!
I'll give you fifty cents.
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
