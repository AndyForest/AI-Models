No comment!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say.
I certainly did not.
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Bird books mostly...
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
Detectives, what is this about?
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Don't wake the kids...
Shhhh..
You bring me such peace...
I love that you're my wife.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Goodnight, honey.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey.
No woman would!
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
Nice?! He should have been executed!
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
