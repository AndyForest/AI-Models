Bring her home... I guess.
Is MOM... in there?
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
You don't think...
Mother?
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??...
What happened?
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Hi, Mom.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
MURDERED?!!
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Jeeezzz!
Here we go again.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Carl's a jerk!
Is there a killer loose?
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Always the dentist.
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
Because it's the rules!
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Sorry, ma'am.
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
In here, Mom...
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
You scared me.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
I'm so happy I could shit.
Looks good, Mom!
Oh Mom...
But Mom, the video's not over.
Let me see!
Thanks, Mom.
She sure can pick 'em!
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
