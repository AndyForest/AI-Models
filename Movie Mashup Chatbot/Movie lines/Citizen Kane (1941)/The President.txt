You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
