No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Can't say, sir.
Yes, sir -
Yes, sir.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Yes, sir.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
Yes and no.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
