You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
You're a caterer?
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
Okay?
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
He tore his ACL.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Not great.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
At one in the morning?
You just got back from a four game road trip.
With who?
We should head over.
Zeke.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Quincy, please...
Just...leave it alone.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Guess he talked to you.
I'm fine.
You scared me.
Later when?
Where's your dad?
Still the man.
How was your game?
You hearing me?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
What is this?
Yeah.
What?
