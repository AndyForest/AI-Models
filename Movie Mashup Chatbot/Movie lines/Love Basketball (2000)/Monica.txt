What are you talking about?
It mattered, Mom.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
That's not it.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
No I don't.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
There you go.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Whatever.
So what do I do?
Maybe she is.
Yeah, you met her?
Engaged.
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
Need any help?
What?
Dad around?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
What?
What?
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
I can't eat before a game.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
nothing.
Pants.
I hate it.
Ah, Mom.
Nothing.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Thanks.
Coach...
What?
I can take it.
Wait...
Uh-huh.
My mouth is kinda dry.
Sorry.
Huh?
Sort of.
Oh, sorry.
You're cold?
They ever love you back?
You ever been in love?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
Yeah, right.
Oh, great.
How'd you get him to say yes?
He's in college?
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Mom tell you to do this?
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
No one's forcing her.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Always on my ass, anyway.
No.
You shoot like a girl.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
Chances are there's still a chance.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
What?
I was just showing emotion.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
You ever think about going back?
Just not my type, I guess.
I wouldn't know.
How's that been?
Just like that?
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
What's up, Sidra.
What's that?
I know.
Thanks.
But?
What's up?
Didn't have to try very hard.
I was just playing ball.
Thanks, Sidra.
What's up with that?
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
So you're gonna bitch up?
Your heart.
One game.  One-on-one.
I'll play you.
Better late than never, right?
Then why are you so upset?
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
From basketball.
You asked me what was missing.
We need to talk.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
Something was just missing.
Why do you keep asking me that?
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
Wow.
Like what?
You're serious.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
It just isn't.
That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
So...how's the knee?
Who's this guy I always see her around?
You visiting?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Actually, I don't...
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Oh yeah?
Kiss my ass.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
We won the championship.
I forgot, "Q-man."
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
What are the doctors saying?
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Uh huh.
So that's it, just forget about us?
When did you decide all this?
You're what?
You don't think so?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
What?
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I never asked you to choose.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Cheap date.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Are you out of your mind?
What the hell's going on?
Woman...
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
You weren't at my game.
Hey.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
You want to go talk?
Who's nobody?
Who was that?
he's just playing, Q...
Sorry about your game.
I've been trying to find you all day.
Hey.
Quincy...
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
I...can't.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
You're not stupid.
She understands.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
I won.
Yo, where's the "D"?
Kiss my booty.
Give me the ball.
What?
What are we playing for?
That was so weak.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Quit.
I said fine.
Fine, Quincy.
You do see me standing here, right?
Whatever, big head.
What'd it say?
You finish the reading for E-con?
I know, right?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
What?
Why?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Mulholland Drive.
Early night for you, isn't it?
So you took Shawnee, huh?
He ain't Spalding.
Yeah.
Hey.
You either.
Yeah.
Good.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Would you watch the damn road?
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Who's Spalding?
I don't.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Please.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
A ride home.
Way to hoop.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
I don't have to do what you say.
So?
I want to ride my own bike.
For how long?
Okay.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
I don't like flowers.
What do I have to do?
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I don't care.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
He works at a bank.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
I just can.
Uh huh.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
One, up.
Give it yourself.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
No.
Hey.
