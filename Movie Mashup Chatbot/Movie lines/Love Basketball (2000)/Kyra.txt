Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
To do what you love.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Why not?
Four days.
Get used to it, babe.
What?
Yes, we appreciate that.
Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
Hello.
Why are you up?  Get in bed.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
