You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
What?
You want the job or not?
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
This time get your feet set.
