He's fine.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
What'd you do?
But you use potato?
Are you okay?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
Too many times.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
You do.
I told him you looked like me.
And he's fine, girl.
This brother from my college.
No.
I know...
I found you someone.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Mom's going to hate it.
That too tight?
