Thanks, sweetheart.
You sure?
Which one for tomorrow?
Camille, she'll be fine.
She's alright.
I'll take that as a compliment.
So how's the job going?
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
Hey, munchkin.
I know.  But chances are...
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
You lost your head.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
