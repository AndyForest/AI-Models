...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
...Office 2702.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
What's that man's name?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...What?
No.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No?
You say it just to calm me!
No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!
No! I don't want to leave you!!
How shall we get out now, Leon?
I don't know... Five minutes.
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example...  And forgetting all this...
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
May I ask you a personal question?
Yes.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
How many girlfriends did you have?
...Don't you like me?
...Don't you drink?
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
I love you so much, Leon.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
Risky business, isn't it?
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
A little...
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
What shall we do?
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
When I say I love you.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...I'm going to kiss you.
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Why?
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
May I go to the cinema?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
Yes.
...Because I feel it.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
You were scared, weren't you?
OK.
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Yes, yes...
The yellow and pink.
OK.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Who'll I aim at?
Wow! It's brilliant!
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
What, for example?
How can you say it?
Huh... 500 meters?
OK, I'm fine.
I have no fear.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
...I got lost, Mister.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...No... he's my lover...
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
...Composer.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
Fine...
Can I sit on the stairways now?
...And how much is it?
Huh? Why?
