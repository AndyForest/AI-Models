Well, I don't need them...
Why can't I have a bank account?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
No, no.
No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Yes.
...Not at all.
Yeah.
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Mathilda, listen!
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Yeah, what?
Nothing, for the moment.
...Yes.
Three times, then two times.
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
...I don't know.
...No...
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
Poor darling, and then?
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
It's too big.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
...Later.
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...Why didn't he close the window?
Where are you going?
I think.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
...17.
Mathilda?!
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
What?
Stop. Everyone is looking.
Mathilda, stop, please!
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
I never rent my gear.
Too heavy.
Not taken.
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
No, you can't go out.
No.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
Mathilda? May I come in?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Come on, get down!
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
What?
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
OK.
Now, try a running guy.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Good! First shot!
Perfect.
Whoever.
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Rocket launcher.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
130... 140...
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Good.
