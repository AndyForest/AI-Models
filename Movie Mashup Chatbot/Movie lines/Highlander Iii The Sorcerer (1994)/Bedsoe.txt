Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
What do you think?
Talk to me about what?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Not now.  I'm busy.
So?
Why?
He had to come from somewhere.
Anything from the bank?
I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
This ties in with Nash.
Tough.
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
I'd like you to see this.
Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
What is it?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
What?
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Get outta here.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
You sure?
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
No.
She was a good woman.
And Brenda?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Where were you last night around nine?
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
When did you get back?
Lieutenant.
