I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
It's circumstantial.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
