I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
You stayed here again last night?
It has to be.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
What's that next to him?
How could they get by him?
What?  How?
Why?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
