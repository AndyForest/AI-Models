I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Is there anything else you need?
How can that be?
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
You know it's not safe here for you.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
Why?
What will you do?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
What are you doing?
Yes.
