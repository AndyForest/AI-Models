I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
I think it was England.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
We don't have any proof of that.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
