Yes -- I think it is.
Most people are afraid of death.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
It's late.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Is that it?
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
No.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
Around.
No.  I don't scare easy.
Central Park.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
A few days ago.
Congratulations.
Detective Bedsoe.
You can go first.
That doesn't matter.
No -- I will.
It's done.
No.  What am I to do?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
What worries you?
Then she should be an excellent dancer.
To ask her to dance.
Living.  Remember?
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
France.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
As friends -- always as friends.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
Thank you, Thomas.
Maybe myself.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
I'm leaving.
That is what bothers me.
Yes.
The river.
I hear you.
You?
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Sing.
Must you do that?
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
Who are you?
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Aye.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
I would like to say goodbye.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
She's a treasure she is.
I think you just like to eat dirt.
Can you really tell from doing that?
Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Aye.
I cannot explain.
You'll no see me again.
I'm leaving in the morning.
I cannot stay.
Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
Sometimes.
Different places.
Aye?
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Conner?
Get out.
He will not stop until it is over.
It will end tonight.
He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
I've seen it.
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
So?
You don't really believe this do you?
Why not?
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Why don't you tell me.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Is it?
That makes you uncomfortable?
I wanted to get to know you better.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
I've lived all over the world.
Why?
I know.
Sorry.
Good evening.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
No.
I'm interested in mythology.
About what?
New York is dangerous place.
I don't know.
I don't have any answers for you.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
I don't know anymore.
Because it's my name.
I'll be fine.
Where did you get it?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
You got me.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
A lucky guess.
In the highlands?
Corpses?
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
What do you want?
Are you a cop?
I remember you.
It will not end tonight.
Why did you wait?
That's what the Kurgan said.
This cannot be.
And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
It's not for me to decide.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
My dreams died long ago.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
Fine.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
You kept it?
