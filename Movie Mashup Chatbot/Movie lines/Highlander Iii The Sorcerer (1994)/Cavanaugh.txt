No -- after you.
You always get to go first.
I stood up first.
I'll go first.
Well?
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
You.
Yes.
She's the King's cousin.
You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
What are we doing here?
Me?  Of course.
How long is the voyage?
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
If it came down to it what would you do?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
I'm sure they will.
For what?
Then it's worth the journey.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Leaving what?
I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
That's all?
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
What?
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
You?
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
Caution shows wisdom.
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
