Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Well, promise then.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Here I am, my angel.
