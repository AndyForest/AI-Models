She'll be fine.
Hostages?
Anybody been hurt?
Jimmy, how's the -
Everything on it?
You do?
I'll try to remember that . . .
Lois, I really don't see why --
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
I like worrying about you.
Lois, someday --
What else could I do?
"They?"
You're not selfish at all.
I'm sorry.
Sleep well?
Hi.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Say you love me.
Let's go to my place.
Let's go to my place.
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
We'd better talk.
I didn't think I wanted to.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Lois, I . . .
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
What??
How could you win a crazy bet like --
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Who ????
Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Superman? Oh, was he here?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Lois, you're amazing.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
A "complimentary corsage."
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
It is kinda romantic.
Really?
Maybe I could try --
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Actually, yes.
I do?
I don't?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Uh. . .
Lois, what are you doing?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, I usually do.
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
Gee. But --
What??
Does Lois know about this yet?
But . . ..that's terrible!
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Uh...home...
