Everything on it.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
. . . Superman?. . . . .
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Never closed my eyes.
Oh, hi.
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Let's get you inside . . . .
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
I want to.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
I'm listening.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
Maybe you wanted to.
I was right. you are Superman.
It's true. It's true.
Oh Clark, no!
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Where were you?
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
In July???
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Be my guest.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Superman! The --
