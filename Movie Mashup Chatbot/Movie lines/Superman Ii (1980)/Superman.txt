Yes.
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
So --  I hope you like it.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
You must be freezing.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
