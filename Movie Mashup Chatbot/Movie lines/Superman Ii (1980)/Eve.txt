Good. My heart can't take it.
I like trees.
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
Wrong.
It's beautiful.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Genius!  --  Lex.
This way Lex.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
