Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.

So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.

You'll have to pack quickly.

No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Cuba.
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
