What do you want?
We will bring him to his knees!
He has powers as we do . . .
He flies as well, then . . .
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
Put down Lex Luthor !
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
What more?
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
He ran in fear from us . . .
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
Who is this . . . Superman?
Zod.  Zod.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
It will. Starting with your own.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
We must combine our strength.
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
Stay. I will come to you.
So this is the planet Houston . . .
And I will lead.
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Free!
