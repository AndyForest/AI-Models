That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
You hitched yet?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
