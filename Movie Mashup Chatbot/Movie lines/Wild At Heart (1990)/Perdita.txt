What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
No, of course.
Used to.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Nice of you to drop by.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
I know... I remember.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
You really are one dumb asshole.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
By who?
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
