United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country.
That is my permiso.

Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?

Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
In many capacities.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
