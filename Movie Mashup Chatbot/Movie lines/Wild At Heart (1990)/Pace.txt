Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
I'm scared, mama.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
You ain't actin', mama.
What I made you do, mama?
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
