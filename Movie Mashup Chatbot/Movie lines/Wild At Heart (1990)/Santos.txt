Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
You got nice tits.
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Put your shoulders back.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
On one condition...
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Through the forehead?
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Where?
Where? In the leg?
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Explain it... I told you.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Simple? Kill him? How?
You need to explain it.
Just tell me what you want.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Get rid of him?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Take care of him?
What do you want me to do about it?
Have it your way... But you want it.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
I knew you'd want it again...
