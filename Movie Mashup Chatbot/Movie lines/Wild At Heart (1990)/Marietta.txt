You won't of missed much.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
This 'bout the fifth time?
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
What is it, Johnnie?
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
What if I told you not to?
What if I asked you not to?
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Got any plans?
What time's Sailor's train get in?
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
Oh God! What does that mean?
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
Where we goin'?
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
No...
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Someone's gonna see us.
What?
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Santos... I can't...
No... But...
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Yes.
Yes.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Yes.
In the head.
No.
Yes.
Shoot him.
Santos...
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
That's your business... I don't care how.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Yes... Get rid of him.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Yes.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Santos... It isn't.
That's not why I called.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Well, she wants to fuck you.
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
