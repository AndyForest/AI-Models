Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
