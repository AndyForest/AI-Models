Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave. Say "fuck me"... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it...
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?...  Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
I don't mean your head head - I'm not gonna piss on your head - your hair an' all... Just piss in the toilet. Y'all take a listen - here a deep sound comin' down from Bobby Peru.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
How old are you?
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
That's right... Take one of these.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
This is easy money, pardner... No ones gonna get hurt in this thing... And I don't think you can afford not to take it... I'll be bringin' the Eldo 'round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin'... If you ain't a pussy - you'll be there.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
Ready for another?
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
You an indian?
You black?
Sorry to hear it.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Thought maybe Sparky and Buddy'd taken ya. Come on, I'll drive.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
How 'bout a beer?
Need a hand?
I'm from all over.
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
What'd you say?
No shit?!?! You know him?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
You heard from Reggie?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
