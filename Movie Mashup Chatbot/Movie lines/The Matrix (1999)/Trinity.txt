... yes.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
The Matrix isn't real!
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
You killed them.
An accident?!
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Are you sure this line is clean?
Did you hear that?
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
Don't be ridiculous.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
How long?
What is he doing?
They'll be able to track it.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
I got a fibrillation!
All right --
Goddamnit!
Are they any agent?
Not yet.
Are you all right?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Neo, how did you do that?
No one has ever done anything like this.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
I'm coming with you.
What?
Because...
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
No, you... have to be.
What?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
You can't!
What are you doing?
What choice?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
What happened?
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
We have to!
Go!
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
What happened?  What did you see?
What did you just say?
Are you all right?
She told me...
Yes.
No.
Are you worried?
That's different.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
What?
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
It's going into replication.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
And I know that's not where you want to be.
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
From you.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
They're watching you, Neo.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
Most guys do.
What?
That was a long time ago.
My name is Trinity.
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Hello, Neo.
Hurry, Neo.
What just happened?
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
Neo!
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Dozer?
Tank, you're hurt.
Got it.
Cypher, I thought --
We need an exit!
He's alive.
Tank, it's me.
