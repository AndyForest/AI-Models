You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
I don't know... My computer...
Right...
If you get caught using that --
You got the money?
You're two hours late.
Who is it?
Thanks... for the drink.
How?
What happened to them?
How many were there?
Really?
... Yeah.
Do you always look at it encoded?
Is that...?
What are you doing?
Sorry.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Morpheus, I don't know --
Did you believe in them too?
Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
And you still believe I'm the One?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
What did she tell you?
She helped you?
And she's never wrong.
How does she know?
And she knows what?  Everything?
The beginning?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
What's going on?
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
How?
Yeah.
I think I do.
What -- what lesson?
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
I thought it wasn't real.
Because... I didn't think I would?
I know what you're trying to do --
You -- you're too fast.
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
For what?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
This isn't real?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
When?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
Why do my eyes hurt?
What are you doing?
... am I dead?
This can't be...
What does that mean?
What truth?
The Matrix?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
No.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
You could say that.
It's an honor.
... Yes.
What do you know?
The agents --
No way, no way, this is crazy.
No!  It's too far away.
How do you know all this?
But what if...?
How?!
What the fuck do they want with me?!
Holy fucking shit!
Right now?
Who's coming for me?
Morpheus...
Hello?
What?
What do you mean, without him?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
What?
I'm not the One.
But what?
Honestly?  I don't know.
Who?
How did you know...?
Shit, I'm sorry.
What vase?
Yeah.
You're the Oracle?
Hello?
Can you fly that thing.
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
It wasn't fast enough.
Do what?
Yeah?
No, you're not.
What are you doing?
I believe I can bring him back.
Why?
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
I have to.
I'm going in after him.
That I would have to make a choice...
There has to be something that we can do.
I don't know.  It just went dead.
Is Morpheus alive?
We can't leave him!
What is it?
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
... right as rain.
What did she tell you?
Did you go to her?
Should I be?
Is it?
But an Oracle can.
What does that mean?
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
God...
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
Get this thing out of me!
Uh-oh...
What is this thing?
... shit.
Why?
From what?
What the hell is this?!
What is the Matrix?
Who is?
Of what?
How did you do that?
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Gee-zus.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Who are you?
How do you know that name?
It's locked.
Which way?  Which way?
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Because I believe in something.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
What do they want?
How much time?
How?
What are they doing to him?
See who?
Hell yes!
Holy shit!
Where is it?
It's a city?
Zion?
You don't have...
No.
