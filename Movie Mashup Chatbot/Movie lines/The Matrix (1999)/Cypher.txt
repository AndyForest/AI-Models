No!
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
He had an accident.
Hello, Trinity.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
There's something about him, isn't there?
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
Hear what?
I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.
You don't, do you?
Do you?
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Any time.
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
Dead.  All dead.
Five.  Since I've been here.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?
Why you're here?
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
The Matrix?  Yeah.
Midnight watch.
No, it's all right.
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
He's going to pop!
Just get me outta here.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I need an exit!  Fast!
