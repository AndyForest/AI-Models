Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
I got you.
Cypher?
Operator.
How...?!
I'm going to make the call.
Yes, sir.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
Now left and that's it in front of you.
Got it.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
Duck!
Operator.
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Why?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
What are you talking about?
Neo, this has to be done!
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
They're hacking his mind.
The Oracle.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
They've burned through the outer shields.
I don't know.  I lost him.
I can't!
What the hell just happened?
Operator.
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
I'll be all right.
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
You're not far from Cypher.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
Operator.
