You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
What's funny?
Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Not too bright though.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
That vase.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
