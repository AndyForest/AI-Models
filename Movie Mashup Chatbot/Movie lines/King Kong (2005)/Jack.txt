Ann ... Ann!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
We're leaving.
Leave it, Ann.
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
I'm sorry ...
Value? ... Value?
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
Holy God! The mummy walks!
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
What?
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
They were just tasting the berries.
) They are now.
That's your monkey, Denham.
You better not slow us down, Denham!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
An ape ... some kind of ape.
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Compassion.
Coz of something I lost.
Yeah.
