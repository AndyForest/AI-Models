Get the hell out of here.''!
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
It's ... lovely.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... ï¿½ organize an expedition -
Father ... Father!
Father!
I photographed it extensively, father.
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
You're the animals - all of you!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
Jack!...  Jack!
No! Don't!
Give it back!
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Jack!
It's the same image - Kong!
There's a light up ahead.
I can't imagine you crying.
I want to thank you.
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Can you fly?
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
Where do I charter a boat?
No!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
He's grubbing for money, father.
