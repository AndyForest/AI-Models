How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
A prior engagement overcame me.
What are you talking about?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Birth control.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
In a bit.
Here.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Ben--
None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
Here you are.
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Educated guess.
Social work?
It's not like we're too busy.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
It's really quite all right.
I insist.  Don't touch them.
Please don't.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Just be careful.
Jesus, Jim!
Play with the whip.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
