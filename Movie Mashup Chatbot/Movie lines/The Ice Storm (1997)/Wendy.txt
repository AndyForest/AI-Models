He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
Yeah.
Huh?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Talking to me, dad?
What do you think we're doing, dad?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Nothing.
Nah.
Good-night dad.
Fascist!
Dad stop it!
I don't like coffee.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
You're not a psycho!
Mom. Are you ok?
We were just riding around.
Nobody.
With Mikey?
Hi mom.
Yeah.
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Yeah. Yours?
Huh?
Wow!
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
You have to follow me?
Then why'd you come after me?
Did you tell Sandy?
Sure.  Twinkie?
I have plans.
Right.
And?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Is this Charles?
Hood residence.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
With who?
Can I come?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Greetings, Charles.
Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Charles.
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
One more shot?
You never tasted the stuff?
Want a drink?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
They left it in the jungle.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
He's dead.
No.
Yeah.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
I have to go to the bathroom.
The ones you built?
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
Yeah? See ya.
Hey Sandy.
