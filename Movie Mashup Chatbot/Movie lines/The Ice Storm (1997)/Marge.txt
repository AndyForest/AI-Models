Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
