No!
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
You going to tell dad?
It's freezing.
Where you going?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Geometry?
Mikey?
No one.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
I don't know. How do I know?
I love you.
Huh?
Okay.
It feels warm.
Vodka?
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
Communist Viet Cong.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Are you his girlfriend?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
All my model planes.
Well, you can...
Mikey was looking for you.
Hey Wendy.
