Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
You okay?
Of course.
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
You want coffee or something?
Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
