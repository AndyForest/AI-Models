What?!
I would like to use the bathroom --
Why?  What's the problem?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Jon -- for Godï¿½s sake, what do you see?
Jon --
Jon, where are we?
Jon -- what??
What -- am I --
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
You -- you know about me and Dan?
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Jon, no -- I can't --
Collect me?
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Mm hmm.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Blake?  Dead?
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Dan -- what do we do now?
Everything's changed --
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Where did he go?
What was he doing?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
What's he doing?
. . . What??
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
That's because --
Yes you are.
The costumes.  Am I right?
They're practically on us . . .
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
They're following us.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Okay!
Don't look.  Turn around.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Antarctica??
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
His what?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
You're sure?
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Damn straight.
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Jon??  You mean he's --
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Am I free to go?
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
What does this mean?  What does it --
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
Then why don't you ask him?!?
I don't know their real names!
I don't know their real names.
Maybe I'll do that.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
Please.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Adrian.
