Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
What's your theory?
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Hi, Jon.
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Then I�ve been a very bad boy and you�ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I�m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
I�m not.
Don�t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won�t even be here, will we?
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
No comment.
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
I'm sorry about Blake.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
What about you?
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
He's a little farther gone every time.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
What is that ungodly smell?
Ever see one of these before?
