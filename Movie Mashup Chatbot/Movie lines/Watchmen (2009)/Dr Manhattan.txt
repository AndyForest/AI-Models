WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
The bearer of bad news.
Hello, Adrian.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Veidt�s complex.
The south pole.  Time�s flowing backwards.
It�s very strange.  Time�s flowing backwards . . .
Cured, yes.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
I won't do that.
You're the only human being I care for.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
Because --
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
I could stay and go.
Would you like me to stay?
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
I'm here, Laurie.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
