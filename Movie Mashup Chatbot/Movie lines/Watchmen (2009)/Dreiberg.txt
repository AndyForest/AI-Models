You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
What if you�re wrong??
And what if you�re wrong?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
What is it?  How does it work?
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
What??
The missing scientists.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
She's with me.
Who?
Good night.
No.  I just wanted you to --
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Those cars.  What year is this??
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
I think he's going to the john.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
What?
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
What the hell -- ?
This'd better not be what I think it is.
What are you up to?
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
You and me.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Memory lane.
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
Laurie --
-- What is it.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
. . . What?
Old?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Play one.  Educate yourself.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
His . . . whatever.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
Maybe not, but why take chances?
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
nan
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Adrian.  It�s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
I don't think she's coming with us.
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
What do you mean, frame-up?
What new information?
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
. . . That was quick.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
