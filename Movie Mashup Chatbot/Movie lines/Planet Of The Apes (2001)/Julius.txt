He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
I'll see.
What happened?
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
Huh?
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
