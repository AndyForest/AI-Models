We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Well, maybe they're not.
'I am not a missing link.'
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
You didn't think so then.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
'Then how do you account for me?,
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
The blood transfusion.
Look -- she remembers.
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
No.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
This place is dirty, doctor.
Will he live?
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Do as I say.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
He's trying to form words.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
The Hunt Club.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
I told you not to bring the other one.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
Thatï¿½s a lie!
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
We can't.
It's humiliating.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Taylor, you can't.
Taylor! Tell him.
Taylor, please --
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
You want her that much?
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Are you going to take her with you?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Which one?
A hearing.
Shhhh!
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
But the proof? The doll?
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
But there's the doll, sir.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
He doesn't know.
This is his assertion.
Like you, I find it difficult.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Yes, Sir.
But perhaps he understood --
He's moving his fingers!
