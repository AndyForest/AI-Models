Good luck then.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Shut up.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
Where does the river lead?
I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
Just the same, I want one.
Do you have any weapons?
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Let's find them all.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
None at all.
That way.
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Geiger counter?
Got your sensors?
Show this to the President.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
No cigar.
Okay.
Let's take a look.
But I'm not prepared to die.
Don't bother
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
By our time.  You've turned gray.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Landon! Join the expedition.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
We're here to stay.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
To Earth! That we've landed!
Landon! Send a last signal.
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Lucius.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
Relax. You'll see it all later.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
I'm for that.
Fine. Just let her out.
I want her.
She comes along too.
Come on. Get me out of here.
Who are you?
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
One is in a museum!
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
My name is Taylor.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
Sure.	In a cage.
Then there is another jungle?
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Tell him to pull back!
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
Stop right there.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
I don't know.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Then you admit --
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
What about it?
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
No.
What about me?
With one of them.
God bless you.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
Would you like to come along?
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Why not?
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
Maybe not.
Yes.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Listen-
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
You! ... You knew about this?
Second from the left.
It's him...Landon.
What is this?
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
