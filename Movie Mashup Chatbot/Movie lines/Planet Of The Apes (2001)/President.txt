Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Sustained.
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
Sustained.
How so?
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Read it yourself.
Mind your tongue, madame.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
