He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture.

Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.

Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
