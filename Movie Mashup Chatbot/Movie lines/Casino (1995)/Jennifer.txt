Hello.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Good to meet you.
All right, we're clear.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
You go and put your things away.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
...same outfit.
Well, you know...
Great.
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
Incredible.
Wow.
Hey, how you doin'?
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
I think that's it.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
