I understand.
No problem.
He's good. He's fine.
Hm.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
No. I ain't see anything like that.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Of course, Remo.
I'll tell him, Remo.
I know.
What're you gonna do?
I know.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
I'll take care of it, Remo.
How are you?
Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
No more! You see? Watch!
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Take it easy!
Whoa. Calm down.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.
Don't know.
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Yeah.
They'll do it.
Angelo and Buster.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
What?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
I know. I know.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
You must have drunk too much.
Let's get out of here.
He's here.
They're havin' a good time too.
Mm.
It's up to you.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
Remo.
This is Nick.
And this is Stacy.
Hey. This is Shelly.
I took care of everybody.
She asleep?
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
This peter's a motherfucker.
Get up.
Get up.
Smarten up.
Of course.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Well, how come I laid nine?
