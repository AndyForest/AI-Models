Seven o'clock?
Okay. You come by the house?
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Are you sure?
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
And I mean... that's no good.
It's in all the papers.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Fine, fine.
Hey, Frankie.
And how are things going down there?
Uh-huh. Good.
Fine.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy?
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Ace.
That's enough now!
Ma che cazzo!
You got a round figure on it?
