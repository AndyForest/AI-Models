Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
All right, all right. But I - I -
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
I'm sorry.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
I'm sorry.
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Oh, sorry -
