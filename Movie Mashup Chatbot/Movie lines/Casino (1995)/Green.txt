I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
Why are you doing this to me?
I can't believe you're doing this.
What are you talking about?
What?
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
Thank you.
