But it was just mine.
I am calm!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
Let me in the house! Fucker!
Oh, you are...
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Not gonna let me in?
You are not threatening me anymore!
Don't you threaten me!
Don't you threaten me!
I am not!
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
You get down here!
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
I wouldn't -
I wouldn't do that...
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I want you to let me go.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Fuck you.
Oh, sh-
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
Oh...
Hi, Sam.
I can back him off.
I was with somebody.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Why do you want to do that?
She had the same.
I had a... salad.
To the Riviera.
With Jennifer.
Oscar wants you to call him.
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
I threw it away.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
Fuck you!
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
The arrangement is over!
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Get off of me! Stop it!
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I bought him a watch too.
Mm-hm.
He wanted a watch, too.
He needed some clothes.
With what?
Okay?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Yeah.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Pretty serious.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
I gotta tell ya...
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
Right.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
No, you don't.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
I don't need one.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
You can't make me stop caring...
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
You didn't have to beat him up!
I didn't take your pills.
Huh?
No, he didn't.
You can trust me.
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
No.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
Yeah.
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Oh, fabulous.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Hi. Nice to see you.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Okay.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Oh...
Oh, it's so soft.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
I'm not crying.
Yeah.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Understand?  I'm sorry.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
Good luck.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Hey, Mitch.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Hello.
Okay, thank you for asking.
I'll be right back.
I'm going to go powder my nose.
You just - Just stop him.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
And here. Here.
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
Can I go in?
Can I go in?
Fucker!
He won't let me go in my house!
I'm just trying to get in my house!
He won't let me in my own house!
He won't...
I'll to the FBI!
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
But I'm just trying to leave.
What?
For what?
You fucked with me for the last time!
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
What about my money?
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Yeah. Uh-huh -
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nicky, please...
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Exactly.  He hates me.
No, he's not.
Sure did.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
I did what you told me to.
Exactly.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Yeah?
I don't -
Nothin'.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Bye.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Thank you.
Thanks.
You're so nice.
Oh, come on.
Yeah.  Thanks.
Okay.
He gives a fuck what I do?
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
I do.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
Mm, you want to steal it?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
Am I right?
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Yeah, no shit.
Tell me.
Hi, how are you?
Hi, Jennifer.
But I saw something...
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Well, how 'bout that?
Get lost?
Get lost?
What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Come on.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I told you I was hot tonight.
Yes!
You're driving me nuts!
No, I'm gonna drive.
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
He called you right here.
Here.
Lester - he called you here.
We'll go later.
It means I got the money.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye.
Okay, then.
You do?
Promise?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
No, Lester.
I love you.
I am.
I'm always here for you.
I'm here.
Yeah.
All right.
