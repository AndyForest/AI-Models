Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Yeah, she's here.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Well...
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
It's me.
Sammy.
Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
She was afraid to call you.
I just told you. She called me.
Ginger called me.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Back -
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
Don't ask questions. Just be there.
...hundred yards further down the road.
No, a...
Meet me at three.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
It's none of my business?
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
She came to talk to me...
...to me.
Hey, she came to talk...
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
Yeah.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
I lost control?
Yeah.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yeah?
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Fine.
All right, fine.
Just say so.
You should say so.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
You think he got the point?
Hey, Ace.
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
No, no it's okay.
Listen...
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
Hey, Rich.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
In other words, I'm fucked.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
All right.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Why, somebody's complaining?
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
Thanks, pal.
All right, Ace?
I'm sorry about this. Really.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
What?
No.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
Four aces, Doc.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
Ohh!
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
You mean, I have your permission?
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
Yeah.
Okay, Sammy.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Listen...
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
They payin'?
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
Matter of fact...
Yeah, thanks.
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
No, no? You didn't?
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
Yeah?
Mm.
Mm.
Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...
Is that what you did?
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
He tries to do everything...
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
He's comin' over.
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Oh, thanks, Eddy.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
I'm over here now.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Want me to take this for you?
Yeah.
All right.
Mm.
Mm.
I'll be right out.
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Okay, yeah.
All right. Be careful.
All right, all right.
Get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
It's what you want?
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
A sponsor.
Is that what you want?
Come on. Don't be scared.
Yes, you are.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Everything went to his head.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Yes, you did.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
You did. You're right.
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
Hm.
You know?
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Let me think about that.
Yeah.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
What? What?
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
I'll be there.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
It's all right.
Yeah.
Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
All right?
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
I know what you mean.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
I can see that. Sure.
Sure.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Okay, Sammy.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
All right.
Are they out now?
They check in alone?
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
All right.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
There's more!
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
Why?
You know why, right?
Two?
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
No, no, no, no!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Frankie!
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Yeah, what's to stop him?
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Go fuck yourself.
What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
So are we.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
But he never talked.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Pleasure.
Stacy.
Hey, Shelly.
You walk past me?
Yeah?
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Every night, on the couch.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
What's takin' so long over there?
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
Come here, come here.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
You jag-off.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Hold it, hold it. Here.
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
Kill you,  You motherfucker you!  Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Charlie M?
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights!  Fuck me?
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!
You're a little confused?
I'm positive.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
How you doin'?
Tony.
