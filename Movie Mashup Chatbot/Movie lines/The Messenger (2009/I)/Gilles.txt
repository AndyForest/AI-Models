Yes.  We can pray.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
Do you know how to count?
Jeanne, look behind you.
Reinforcements?  Where??
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Perfectly.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
And... what does Jeanne think?
