Let's see.
You think you are ready now?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Do you think you are ready?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
I don't think so.
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
What for?
What are you doing on the wall?
Really?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
I agree...
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
Really?
In His name??
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
So your memory's coming back?
Oh no?  How about this one?
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
No.  That was a sword in a field.
What signs?
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
God asked you to do something?
Why would they?
They won't come anyway.
Why not?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Who?
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
Why were you yelling like that?!
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
I might ask you the same question.
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
What have you done to me?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
