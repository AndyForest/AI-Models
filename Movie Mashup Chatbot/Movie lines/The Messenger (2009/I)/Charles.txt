Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
It's a miracle she's not dead!
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
So... pretend it's not a game.
Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
What do you mean?
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
But... her army's so small now...
I... I can't stop her.
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
You will??
You really think she's been sent... by God?
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
You think?
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
... and what... what did he say?
You did well...
I'm... I'm not the king...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
Let them come!  Let them see who's the true king of France!
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
My captains have sworn their support.
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
What difference does it make where she comes from?
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
