Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Jeanne, be patient.
Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Only God knows the answer to that.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
And what does he say to you?
What... does he... look like?
Who is this "he"?
Him?
Then... why are you here so often?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Whose were they?
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
So... alright.  What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
But you already confessed this morning...
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
