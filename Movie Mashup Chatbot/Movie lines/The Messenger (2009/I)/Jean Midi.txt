Oh?  Perhaps someone pushed you then?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
