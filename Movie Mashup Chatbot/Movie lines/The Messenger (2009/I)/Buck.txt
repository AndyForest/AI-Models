Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Scared of a girl?
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
We want her burned as a witch!
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
Arrest them!
