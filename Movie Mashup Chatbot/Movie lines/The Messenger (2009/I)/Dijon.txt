Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
I understand.  How much?
Buying her?
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
He's feeling wonderful.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
20,000 gold crowns.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
That's not a lot.
