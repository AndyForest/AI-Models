Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
How many did he give you?
Who gave you that horse?
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
