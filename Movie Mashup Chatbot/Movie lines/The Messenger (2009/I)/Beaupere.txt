... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
Why?
And?
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Do you have a sword?
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
