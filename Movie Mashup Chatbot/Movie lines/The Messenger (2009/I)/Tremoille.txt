Noooo!
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
... as always, majesty...
Your majesty, I really think you...
Supposing she's an assassin?
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
The other half.
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed "X".  What sort of name is "X"?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
