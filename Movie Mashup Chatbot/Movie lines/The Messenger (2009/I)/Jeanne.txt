I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I'm staying, Jean.
One day you will.
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I'm already free...
I am ready now...
That's an order!
Do as I say!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
Not yet!
It would not be the same without you.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
But it is what I want.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
No, but...
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
What did the king say?
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
Tell the king to give me more men.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
So... what am I supposed to do now?
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
I'll go.
Yes...
Come with me...
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
They've started the battle without me!
Good.
What did they say?
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
Who do they think I am?!
The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
I thought you were an archer?
I also need someone who can read and write.
Better today than tomorrow.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
And I would like to see a priest.
I would like some fresh straw.
Do you think I could have some water?
No, I... I never killed anyone!
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, but...
Yes, probably... maybe...
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
To avoid killing anyone.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
Yes...
Quite a few.
I leave the answer to God.
I can't read.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
I don't know...
I don't remember.  Maybe.
I tried to.
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
Go onto the next question.
No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
No...
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
God defeated the English, not me.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Where... where am I?
Am I... am I dead?
But where are you going to be?
What about you?
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
No no, I'm fine, really...
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
Please... may I have it back...
And may I go to Mass?
No... I want to be confessed.
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
Yes...
Many things...
Yes.
Praying.
Last night.
Not long ago...
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
In a village called Domremy.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
The English??
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
Trial?  What trial??
Who are you?
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
So how would you put it?
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Get them out of here!
... You look wonderful...
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
Go on to the next question.
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Yes.
His face.
Go and ask him yourself.
If there was, I didn't see it...
Not yet.
The bridge won't wait!
Stand by with the battering-rams...
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
We're taking back the Tourelles!
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
Sooner is better than later!
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
God.
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
For what?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Good.  Where are the English?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
But my voices... they promised me...
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
So... bring up the reinforcements!
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
No... not like this...
Clear?
The English are rebuilding it.
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
I... submit to Our Lord.
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
The clothes are not important...
No!
Yes, but...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
That's now what I meant...
No...!
No...
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Here -- take this instead.
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Because... because you just can't!
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Stop it!  What are you doing?
You don't believe me anymore?
I said, kneel!
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
If you kill him, you kill me!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
It's not possible...
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
We... won?!
Not for long...
Prepare these as battering-rams!
I'd sooner die than use magic!
Don't swear...
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
No.
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
My king.
Yes... a half-steed... white.
Yes, my lord.
No...
Yes...
Yes I am.
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Are you sent by God?
Are you going to leave me too?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
"Love your enemies"...
No, I...
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Yes... lots of things!
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
What do you mean, they won't come?
Because... I have to be alone!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
My... visions...
Yes!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
I... I never lied!
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
What are you doing out here?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I don't know... I thought...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
Who... who are you...?
I -- I -- I...
Playing...
I want to be at one with Him now.
I want to be with him always...
I don't want to wait for his call.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Why did she have to die?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Beautiful.
He never says his name.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Yes, it is.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Oh yes... very.
Is that bad?
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
My father's.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
I need to confess again.
I need to confess.
