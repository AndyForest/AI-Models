What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
10,000 gold crowns.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Yes, my lord.
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Of course I am, it's just that...
Majesty, I can't...
My lord, I'm not sure that...
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
That's a good idea, sire.
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
I -- I don't understand...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I want to stay with you...
But... why... what's the point?
We must sound the retreat!
Will you at least let me stay with you?
To be killed in battle?
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
To marry you.
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
Tell me...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
You make it sound so simple...
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
What... what do you mean?
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
Because there's an arrow in your leg.
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
Jeanne, no...
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
Well...
I promise...
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
What's going on?!
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
Jeanne, stop it!
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
Now?
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Now?
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
But that was her order!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
We have to press home the attack!
Jeanne's alive!
