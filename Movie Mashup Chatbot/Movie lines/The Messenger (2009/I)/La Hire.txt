No good?  This is a disaster!
Good idea...
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Me too...
Damn right!
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
