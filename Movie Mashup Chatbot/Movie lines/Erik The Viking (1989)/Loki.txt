SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
How do we know this is the way?
What d'you mean?
It was my master Keitel's idea.
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
I should have got rid of you long ago!
You fool!
You've lost your mind.
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
Shut up!
Help!
Help!
I'm drowning! Help!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
Sh! Hurry!
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Wasn't it, Keitel?
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
That's right.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
You could charge him what you like.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
