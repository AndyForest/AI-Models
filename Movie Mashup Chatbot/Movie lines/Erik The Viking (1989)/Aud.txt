It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
But, Father, it IS!
It's your fantasy...
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
You're losing your temper!
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
There IS no one.
Who, Father?
Ah! It's my father!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
Then I shall come too.
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
The second note.
Then let go!
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Do you believe I love you?
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
But you don't realize....
Erik. You don't understand.
No!
Why?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
But, Erik...
Who?
You're as bad as my father.
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Oh, for goodness' sake!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
I've never LOVED anybody!
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
But you LOVED her all the same...
What was she like?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
But surely you know...?
WHY?
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Those things in your hands.
Please! Please! What are those?
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
I said welcome.
