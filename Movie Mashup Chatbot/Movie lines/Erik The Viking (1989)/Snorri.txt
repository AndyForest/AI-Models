No! Arrgh!
I've got you!
Weren't we supposed to?
A magic dishcloth.
Like fish.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.

You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
Trust me to get the missionary.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Thank you VERY much indeed.
You mean we'd be dead?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
Your lord.
Same thing, isn't it?
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
You're wasting your time.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
What have you got there?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Oh...
Who's that?
Well! Come on!
