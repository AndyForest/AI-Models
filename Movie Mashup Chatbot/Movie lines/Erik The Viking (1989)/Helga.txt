Why should you care?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
What a stupid idea.
Why... should YOU care?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
Aaagh! Rape!
Ah.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Well you started it.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
You DON'T like it, do you?
About raping me?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
What?
Oh, get it over with.
What -- rape?
You don't love ME.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
What about the raping?
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Have you done this sort of thing before?
