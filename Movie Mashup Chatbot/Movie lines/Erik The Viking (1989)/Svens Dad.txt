What did he say?
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
It's magic.
The sun! That's it!
SHUT UP!
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
You may need a real Berserk.
He hasn't.
Do what?
What do we have to do?
The Dragon...
I hate you! I hate you!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
He drove me mad!
Helpless...
Well, go on! Go berserk!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Sh!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Stop it!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Not now, Sven...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
So did my father and his father before him.
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
It's a tradition.
