Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
Well... where is he?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Right! Where is he?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Open up! I know you're in there!
The important thing is not to panic.
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Is there something the matter with it?
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Don't talk nonsense.
Why?
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
I'll tell you what...
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Well, how d'you think I feel?
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
We're just not a very musical nation...
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
REALLY?
You're just saying that.
But you don't want to hear it.
A lot of people like our singing.
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
Would you like us to sing to you?
Well... isn't it great?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
