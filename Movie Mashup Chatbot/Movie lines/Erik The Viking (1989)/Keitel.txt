Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
What is it?
Well, what else do we do?
But...
But how could he know... unless...
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
Wait, Erik!
For your own sake... For the others... I...
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Let me go, Sven.
Aaagh!
Get away, Snorri.
What?
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
I... I...
It's not my business any more!
Made by YOU, Loki!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
She knows it was our fault!
Help!
You'll drown us bo...
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
Relax!
YOU do it!
How can we stops him now?
Well... I... I thought...
Together we stand!
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
My brother blacksmiths!
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
Can't make enough axe-heads!
Can't make enough swords!
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
