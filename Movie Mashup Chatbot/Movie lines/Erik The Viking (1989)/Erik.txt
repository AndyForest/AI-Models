But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
No... no...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
Not quite...
The second note to wake the Gods...
Yes -- I believe you do.
I... but I...
Of course.
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
That's right!
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
Goodbye, Aud...
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
I'll bring it back.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Just give me a hand.
Halfdan the Black.
We mustn't let him land!
And the week before that?
Five this week; how many the week before?
And I thought you said it was something special...
"The fifth one this week"!
I've never been to bed with anybody!
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
We never went to bed together.
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
It was different...
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
Yes.
What?
What's the matter?
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
What are what?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
WELCOME?
WHAT did you say?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
But --
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
I will go and wake them up!
Is there nothing men can do?
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
It is day, of course, Freya.
I see the world.
I shouldn't have come.
But it IS! Look!
Yes... oh, yes...
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
He wants to kill US!
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
You've got to let me go!
Yes?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
No.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
No.
Really.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
I'm sure it's lovely.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
How?
No... we don't...
I don't know! I just did!
Odin!
Is THAT Odin?
Well... no...
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
Why?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Tell me your name?
Why should you care?
You told them I raped you -- why?
I didn't mean to!
Oh, thanks.
Louder.
Scream.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
About NOT raping you...
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
I don't suppose... no...
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
Sh!
Shut up.
Yes.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
I know!
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
What's wrong with making friends?
No.
How deep IS the ocean?
It saved my father!
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
Come on, move it!
He was lucky...  Sit there.
What?
"But" what?
Find it... AND cross it!
I... I... KILLED her...
She got me thinking...
I met this girl...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
What's it all about?
Faster!
Slower! In... Out...
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Row! Row! Row!
Well, you ARE!
Look out!
You'll see!
What "magic"?
Look, the sky is blue...
ROW!
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
What are YOU doing here?
But you're the Gods!
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
You must help us.
You'll be sucked down too!
No! Let go, Snorri!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
To the oars!
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
Well, come on!
Row!
That's better.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Now stop it!
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
What's the matter with them?
Oh... er... yes...
Nobody gets killed.
There is another way.
What are you talking about?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!
How about making friends?
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
What do you think?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
Keitel Blacksmith?
I have to go...
Sven!
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
She MUST have a knife or something...
ROW!
We haven't got a spare place.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Hey, you two! What's going on?
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
We'd be the first!
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
