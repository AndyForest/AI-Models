That I cannot tell you.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
Is it night or day, Erik?
What do you see, Erik?
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
