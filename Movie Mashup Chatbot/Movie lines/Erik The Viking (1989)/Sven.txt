I came to find my grandfather.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
Over the Edge of the World.
Hy-Brasil?
She hasn't got any.
DEATH!
I AM one, Dad!
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Look, I bagged it last week.
I was sitting there.
But HOW?
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
What are you talking about, Erik?
I will join my grandfather there.
Hang on...
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
What are you talking about?
Got you!
Dad!
Easy, Dad!
There is nothing we can do...
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Well, of course he is!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
KILL! KILL!
I must KILL! Kill!
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
I must only let the red rage...
But it's a responsibility...
So did your father...
You went berserk...
I know, Dad.
Tell him I'm coming!
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
Thorfinn! You can't die!
Shut up.
Well... I'm game.
Neither am I.
You liar!
