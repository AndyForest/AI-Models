I know.  I'm sorry.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
In your car
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Jeremy phoned this morning
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
I might.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Well, you should.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
Did she talk about me?
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
You just might.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I have to be up early.
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
Well, you know...
I called you a taxi.
Damn.  They're early.
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
And you're at this third stage
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
And I didn't like that man.
I think it went on rather too long.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
Yes, that's right.  I'm being terribly rude.  Bob?  Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett.  Bon was at Oxford too.
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
No, he wasn't.  He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...  'Oo I do feel bad.  I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
Promise?
Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you.
What have you got there?
Don't point it at James!
Oh no!
It was last year.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
You're so famous now.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
I won't.  Goodnight.
