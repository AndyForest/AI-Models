What went wrong?
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Yes.
Well, we were just...
I will, thanks.
Thank you.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Yes.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
Thanks.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
To Ann.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
It's fine, thank you.
Yes.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
What a shame.
He was delightful.
It's kind of you to see me.
I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
Terrific.
Very good.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Thank you.
Exactly that.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
How's Mary?
Keep me company.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
And to history.
Thank you.
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
Freshman and sophomores...
Thank you.
Yes, please.
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
No.  I'd want to--
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
...break away completely from--
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
Hello.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Shall we have a drink or something?
Why not.
That'll be fun
What did he want?
Might?
Might?
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
He's all right, the professor.
I haven't seen much of you.
I haven't really thought about it.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
I think she liked me.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
In radio we're different.
You don't trust me.
Too late.  Just my luck.
Me too.
Why not stay?
Again?
Very thoughtful.
Who?
Both dead.
How nice.
Oh yes?
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Oh, but he was terrific.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
I thought it was tremendous.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Can I give you a lift?
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
That's her.
You're a piece of shit
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Fuck off.
Are you up to something?
Yes, finally.
I'm not sure.
I'll ring you.
Perhaps I will, then.
Will it be fun?
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
Hold those rights.
The torture of small children--
What have you been up to?
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
Ha ha...
You're so gross.
Mmm...
Let me see.
Oh yes.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Let me see.
It's shit.
Come on.  Hand over.
The Argies.
To the Fleet.
Bastard.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Blasï¿½ and epicene.
Nonsense.
Not yet you know any of these people?
To the airlift.
Not here.
What about the Cromwells?
All right.
Suez.  1956.
Not at all.  History.
Oh, I see.
Okay, I will.
Thanks.
I'm waiting for your mother.
Hello.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
I'm not here.
Terrific.
Not bad.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
No, thanks Dad.
Yes, you said.
That's good.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
So how is she?
Dad.
Now listen...
She said that?
U-huh.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Yes.
No.
