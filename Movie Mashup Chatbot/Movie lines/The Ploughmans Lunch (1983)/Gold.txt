It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Are you going to have coffee?
Good.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
And some of that.  Sorry.
I'll have some of that.
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
