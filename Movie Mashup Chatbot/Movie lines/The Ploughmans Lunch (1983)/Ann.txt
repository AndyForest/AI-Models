Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now � the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
Shall we go?
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ...
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
I think you'll do very well.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some p�t�.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
