The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
Or a beer.  I've got some in.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
Hello, Jimmy.
