A glamorous young lady way above his station...
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
Of course.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
It's terribly good.
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Still in love?
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Far too long.
That's enough of that.
No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
Ah, ah.  There's more.  The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter.  Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez.  It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
You approve!
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
Now, top secret file.
And the Argies.
To the Fleet.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
No jokes.  James is in love.
We were just chortling over that. Blasï¿½ and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
To the airlift.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
Promise.
We'll see what we can do.
You'd look naked without one.
Voila!
They won't let you in without one.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
Darling Susan.
