Come on out!  We're friends!
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
We'd be in all the papers!
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
