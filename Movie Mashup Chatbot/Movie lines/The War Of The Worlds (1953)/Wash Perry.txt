Hey, there - open up!
Hey, how about that!
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
Let's go.
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
They'll understand us, all right!
Welcome to California!
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
How would I know...!
Must be somebody in there.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
