They'll probably move at dawn.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
