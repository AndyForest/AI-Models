Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
Dumbshit.
The sawbones?
So where the hell are you, Healy?
You found my car?!
Who the fuck is it to you?
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Am I?
No I can't.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Nineteen months I been sober.
Relax, he just ate.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Stalker, huh?
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Here's the info you asked for.
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Healy you dog!
