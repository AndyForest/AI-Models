No, I just meant...
The thing's kind of heavy.
I'll try to be more careful.
What?
I guess.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Dom? What are you?
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Jesus Christ you're right.
Huh.
I'm usually too tired to be.
No.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Hm?
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
Check.
Got cash.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
I don't know what to say.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Shoot.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Yeah feels like it.
I am?
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Uh-huh.
Well think about it.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Mary's a babe!
Amen to that.
Never met him.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Wait a second, I never told you that.
What's so funny?
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
His mother?
I don't know about this, Dom.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
Yeah, right.
I don't know.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Well once. Mary.
Nah.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Good-looking?
What's he like?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Yeah, but he was successful.
He implied it.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
Mary.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Out getting coffee.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Who?
Who?
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Your turn?
You're a sick man, you know that?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Do what?
Answer the question, shitball.
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Surprised?
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Jai alai?
Miami?
What are you doing?
Uh, that's okay.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
She's in a wheelchair?!
Oh my.
Three different guys?
Huh?
So she's married?
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
No, not at all.
So she hasn't changed?
So you found Mary?
Really?  Very, very?
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
You can't be serious.
No.
No.
You don't buy what?
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
Well, I know you're busy...
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Uh-huh.
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
How do you guarantee that?
I'd go with the seven.
I see where you're going.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
'That right? Good for you.
Hm?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
That must make it tough.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Really?
But but what about Steve?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
What what are you doing here?
You're Woogie?
Okay.
Mary, come on...
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Yeah, sure.
All right, let's go.
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Trying to be.
Well... why don't you move back?
Yeah?
Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
What are you?
No short game.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Now by killer, you mean...?
Sure.
Hm?
You look great.
Hey.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Oh... are you... ?
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
He's dead.
Really? I never got a message.
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
You betcha!
Just a minute.
Oh yeah.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Hi, Mary.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
Huh?
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh yeah. Fine.
No, that's really unneces --
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
One guess.
I think a little of both.
What?! No please, sir --
Shhhhhh!
It.
I, uh... I got it stuck.
I wish.
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
No, no, please!
What do you mean?
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
No! I was pissing!
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
I wasn't trying --
Oh God.
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
Uh-huh.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
So what's up?
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
I'm gonna take a rain check.
How are you doing, Warren?
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
