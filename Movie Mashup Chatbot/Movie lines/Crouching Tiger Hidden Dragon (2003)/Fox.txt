Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
You're already a thief.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
You're home late... or should I say early?
