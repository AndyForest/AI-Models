Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
I owe you nothing.
Shut up!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I'll never live as a thief!
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
He is my defeated foe!
So what if I don't?
Don't bother.
Long.
I have a guest.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
I'm tired now.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
Do you know her?
Put them down.
Please sit.
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Come and get it if you can.
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Where is he now?
You know about Lo?
They forced me to marry!
You, sister...
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
You say she killed a policeman?
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
No, really?
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Please.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
I'm bored.
I've missed you.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You're not married, are you?
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
Really?
You're a sword fighter too?
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Never!
Give it back!
All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
What do you want?
Only the sword will settle this.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Make a wish, Lo.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Don't ever come back.
Go.
If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Don't send me back!
Let them look.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
Give it back.
Give me back my comb.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
You coward!
My comb!
Give it back!
You shouldn't have come.
Lo?
