What do you have in mind?
This is a delicate matter.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
