Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
Yes.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
I don't care about your sword.
Who are you?
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out of her hole.
They're gone.
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
It's Jade Fox!
