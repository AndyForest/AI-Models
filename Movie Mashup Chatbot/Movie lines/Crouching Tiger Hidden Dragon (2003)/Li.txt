That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Where's your master?
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Tell me, who is your master?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
Then you have no use for the sword.
Kneel!
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Let's end this here.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
Shu Lien...
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
I'll look around and catch up later.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
She needs direction... and training.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
Well, we had talked...
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
Have you questioned him yet?
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
Did you see who posted it?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
What have you discovered?
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
Perhaps.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
I left the training early.
Yes.
Fine.
It has.  How's business?
