"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Jen...
I will.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It is trouble for me.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
I don't take orders from anyone.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name?
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
Let's stop a moment.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
Jen!
