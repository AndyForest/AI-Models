Don't be scared.
I'll just shoot him once.
You're lying.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
You're secret identity.  That man was right.
I know now.
Do you know why?
I'm not scared.
I'm sleeping in my room.
All of it.
Get mom.
How much is it?
I lied.
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
I mean if you knew karate?
How much can you lift?
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
I'll help you.
What things?
Just one--
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
I won't make any noise.
I want to sleep here tonight.
