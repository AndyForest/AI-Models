Yes.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Wow.
Oh.
Is Noel in?
I don't know Megan.
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
What about the game?
I'm not sure.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
What was that?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
...I think rust.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
Jesus.
out again?
Would you like to try going--
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
I remember you.
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Megan?
Oh.
Oh shit...
When was the last time I wore pink?
No that's it.
Yes.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
Do you remember me getting sick?
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
He's asleep.
I know.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I don't think I got the job in New York.
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
Quick.
I have to go now.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
I don't know what you're asking?
Yes.
Like what?
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v.
I thought he was carrying something.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
Just give me a minute.
Are you for real?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
What do you want?
It's for last week's game.
I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
At the church... You were following me weren't you?
What was your idea Elijah?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
You assumed wrong.
In college. A car accident.
Skeptical about what?
Seventy-five percent.
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
He's kind of a miracle.
He's doing well today.
We are.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
When?
Yeah?
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
What's he look like?
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
Jeremy listen to what--
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
Elijah was wrong.
Know what?
That's great.
I see.
There's no more left?
How many did you put on that time?
What do you do if something happens?
Two hundred and seventy.
How much did you take off?
No Jeremy.
No.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
No.
No.
There's nothing to do.
I'm going to work out.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
Why'd you do that?
I'm going to go in.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
He doesn't look very threatening.
Yeah, hello.
Not really.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
You like sports?
No.
No.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Against a window.
Fine.
Okay.
