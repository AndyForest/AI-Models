Yes he is.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
On a bench, across the street.
Well, go get it then.
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
...I got a present for you.
You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
