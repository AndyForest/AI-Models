Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
