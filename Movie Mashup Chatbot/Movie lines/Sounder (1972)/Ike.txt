Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
