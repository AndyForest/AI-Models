If anyone's going, I could use some coffee.
Fine.
Can we get some coffee...?
And why is that?
I do?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
You need money?  Is that the...
Do you need five grand?
Why?
In the abstract...
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
I didn't ask to be.
That's ridiculous.
Me?
...I thought that we were only talking...
...you don't have to come in...
Yes.  I'm sure.
No.
Why would I do it?
Why would they come to me?
What if you don't get caught?
What does that mean?
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Dave.
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
I...
Me?
I'm sorry?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
You have to steal the leads tonight?
What?
He'd give me a job.
A job with Graff.
You're saying "me."
For five thousand?
What will he pay?
What did he say?
Did you talk to Graff?
You're going to steal the leads?
You're actually talking about this?
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
We are?
Did you?
You didn't?
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
Well.  Well...
As a robbery.
Talking about it as a...
We're not actually talking about it.
As an idea.
We're just "talking" about it.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
You haven't talked to him.
How do you know he'd buy them?
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
How many leads have we got?
What could somebody get for them?
Huh.
What?
How?
Someone should hurt them.
What?
Yes...?
What do you mean?
What?
What?
When they...
They...
Men come work for you...
That's what I...
You...
No.
Huh.
That's the truth...
That's right...
What act?
What?
What hard part?
What?
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
Himself?
With River Oaks?
Yes.
I heard that they were running cold.
He is?
Nurses.
Yes.
No.
Who?
Yes.
For some sales pro...
Shoes, boots, yes...
...that's right...
No.  That's absolutely right.
...that's right...
That's right?
That's right?
And it's not right to the customers.
It's not.
I...
I, I...I...
You're on this...
It's too...
It is.
...this shit...
We're stuck with this...
They did.
They did.
They came in and they, you know...
What?
I...I don't know.
Well, I think I had one once.
Mmm...
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
To get on the...
I had to.
I'm not?
Where am I going to work?
...they hold on to their money...
...Polacks...
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Did the leads come in yet?
Did they catch...?
Did they...?
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I...
Where did Moss...?  I...
You think so?
Why?
No, who?
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
No.
No.
Was I?
At home.
Yes.
Where were you?
Why don't you think so?
They aren't?
The cops?
A waste of time?  Why?
Yeah.
He said we...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Were the leads insured?
Were the leads...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
They stole...
He said he filed...
I am?
Everything I...you know...
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
It is dead.
Clear...
Yes.  They are old.
Yes.
I can't close 'em.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
I, you know, they should be insured.
I didn't rob...
...how can you talk to me that... that...
We had a robbery.
That's great.
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
I don't want to go to lunch.
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
That they're going to be upset.
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
In school.
