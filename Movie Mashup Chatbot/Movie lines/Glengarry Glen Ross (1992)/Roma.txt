I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
No.
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
You understand?
Will you excuse us please?
Will you excuse...
Yes.
They're inured to it.
Thieves.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
You have nothing to hide.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Yes.
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
I was at home, where were you?
Where was I?
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
No.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
To the cops?
What?
...what am I going to do all month...
Down the street.
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit...
They stole the phones.
They stole the...
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
That's...
It's a waste of time.
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
They're ancient.
Huh?
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
What?  You can't do any what?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
What do you care...?
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
You're done, come down, and let's...
Anyone in this office lives on their wits...  I'm going to be with you in a second.  What you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you?
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
Are you talking to me?
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
...did they...
Did they get my contracts?
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Yeah.
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray.
Oh, God...Oh, God...  Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.  I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go.
I'm sorry...?
What?
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
You're sure?
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
The monthly interview...?
Home...
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Yes.
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
Kenilw...
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
Oh, Christ.
He's right, Williamson.
That's right, Shel.
...yes...
You closed 'em today?
Like you taught me...
Harriett...
"Always be closing..."
Fuck her...
How was it...?
Fuck you care...?
Fuck you, Dave...
Guess who?
Mmm.
Last night, this morning.
They took the phones...
Shelly...!
Eight units?
You sold eight Mountain View?
Not to my knowledge, no...
It's nothing.
What did I tell you?  What did I say about the three days...?
What?
Forget the deal, Jimmy.  Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Jim.  I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
What, "this"?
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What power?
What...?  Say the words.
What...?
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
What does that mean?
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
No, Jim.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
We're going to speak to her.
You tell me again.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
Tell me again.
What is?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
And when was that check cashed?
What was yesterday?
When did you write the check?
What would have elapsed?
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
You don't count Saturday.
I don't understand.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
Of course you have three days.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
Three days.
Why did she do that, Jim?
Who did she call?
Monday.
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock.
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not.
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf� au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act?
Yes.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
Yes.
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Have a good trip.
Your farewell to the troops?
What is this, your farewell speech?
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum.
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
They took 'em...
We haven't got a lead...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Guess who?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
You hear what I said?
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Guess what the Machine did?
You going to turn State's?
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
...Mr. Williamson...
John...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads.
Three?  I count two.
Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine.
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
You did?
Yes.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Some of them...
The...
Did they...
They didn't get my contracts.
