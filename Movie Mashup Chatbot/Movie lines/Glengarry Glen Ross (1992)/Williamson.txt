Mmm.
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch?
Excuse me...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Go to lunch, George.
Just go to lunch.
The leads come in, I'll let...
Go to lunch, will you...
Shelly: get in the office.
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
What?
I don't know, George, why?
I'm sure that we're insured, George...
Who used to say that?
Fuck you.
Because I don't like you.
I'm sorry.
Call up the bank.  I called them.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Only the beginning...
What sales?
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
Mmm.
Uh-huh?
Was it?
That was easy, wasn't it?
Who kept the other half?
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
You robbed the office.
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
No.  It hadn't.
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
How do you know I made it up?
How do you know I made it up?
Excuse me...
Why I don't...
What are you trying to tell me?
You are?
Mmm.
Yes.  I hear you.
Mmm.
It's not impossible.
I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly.
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
The leads are coming.
Somebody broke in.
That's alright.
Is that what you're saying?
You want something off the B list?
Because I say so.
I can't split them.
I have to go...
I can't do it, Shelly...
No.
Can't do it.
I wish I could.
Now.  Yes...When?
Alright.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
I'm not sure I have two.
What are we going to say?
And fifty bucks a lead.
Twenty percent.
Not lately you can't...
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
What if you don't close...?
Of what?
I can't do it, Shel.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
The leads are assigned randomly...
...they kicked out.
Yes.
Either way.  You're out.
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
Murray said...
Murray said...
You know what those leads cost?
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
...let me...are you listening to me...?
Let me...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Murray...
...after the thirtieth...
It isn't me...
Not lately it isn't.
Moss.
Roma.
All that I'm saying...
...I only...
...no...
...no...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
What about the other two?
Shelly...
...you didn't close...
Shelly, you blew the last...
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
Your contract went out to the bank.
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
We had a slight burglary last night.
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
Yes.
Three.
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
If you don't want it, give it back.
...you want to go out today...?
I have the stuff from last year's...
Aren't you going out today?
Where are you going?
I...
Yes.
It went down.  I filed it.
You closed him yesterday.
They took some of the con...
Listen to me: They got some of them.
They got, listen to me...
They didn't get the contracts.
They--excuse me...
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
