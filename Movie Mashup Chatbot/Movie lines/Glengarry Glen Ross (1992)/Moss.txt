Uh-huh.
How ya doing?
Because you listened.
Yes.
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
Is that what I just said?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
So I'm making it concrete.
You went for it.
That's none of your fucking business...
That's right.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Absolutely.
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
...and rob the place...
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
Are you sure?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
They're going to come to everyone.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
Oh, yes, George.
Yes.
Yes.
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Yes.
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
You.
You...
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
What?  What?  The leads.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
He would take you on.  Yes.
Is that what I said?
Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
A buck a shot.
Yes.
What did he say?  He'd buy them.
Is that what I said?
Did I say that?
Have I said that?
That's right.
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
What did you say?
No.  Not actually.
Not actually, no.
Hey.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
No.
No.
Yes.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
No, we're just...
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
Yes.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
Someone should rob the office.
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
Yes.
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Should do something to them.
Somebody...
Someone should stand up and strike back.
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
They have...
...you're absolutely right.
You fucking build it!  Men come...
You build it!
You...
You don't ax your sales force.
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
Just the act.
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
Starting up.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
The nurses?
He's doing very well.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
...cower in his boots...
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
Eh?
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
Eh...?
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
No.
It's not right.
Some contest board...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
You get a bad month, all of a...
Eh?
It's too...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
And now...
They killed the goose.
Well, they fucked it up.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
You did?
You ever get 'em?
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
Deadbeats all.
Polacks and deadbeats.
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...?
What does that mean?
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
And did they steal the contracts...?
Shit.
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
You did that?
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
I'm going home.
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
Why not?
You just this morning...
When...
Fuck you.
You did that?
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Fuck the Machine.
Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Fuckin' asshole.
