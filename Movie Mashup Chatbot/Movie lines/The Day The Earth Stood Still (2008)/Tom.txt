You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
How do you know?
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
Come on in.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I wonder if we ought to--
Looks real to me.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
You ready?
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
You still haven't answered my question.
Well, we could--
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
No -- no, thanks.
You sure about that?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
Is it worth anything?
