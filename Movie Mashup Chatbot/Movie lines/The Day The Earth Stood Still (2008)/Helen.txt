Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
He gave these to you?
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Tell me what?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
What do you mean, dear?
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Of course, dear.
Professor Barnhardt.
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
I'm not going to marry anybody.
I feel different right now.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Is that what you're thinking about?
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
What about him?
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Is it real?
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I will be in just a minute.
Hello--
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
It was a wonderful day.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
No. That's all finished.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
But how -- how long--?
You mean he has the power of life and death?
I -- I thought you were--
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
Where is the meeting going to be?
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Where are you going now?
Yes -- Just exactly.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
Why not?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Just twelve.
What happened?
What is it you want?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
Yes--?
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
Oh -- hello--
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Naturally I think so.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Jittery is the word.
I don't know how to thank you.
