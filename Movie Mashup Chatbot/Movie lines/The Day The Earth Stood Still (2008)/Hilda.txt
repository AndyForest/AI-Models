He'll be there at 8:30.

You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
