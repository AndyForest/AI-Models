Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Yes, I have!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Okay.
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Hi Mom!
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Goodnight.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Mr. Brady's a cop.
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Well, sure, but--
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
No foolin'? Will you?
Go to the movies.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
What does that mean?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
You think they'll ever find him?
Gee! How could they make a landing?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
I thought that was only for bombs.
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Are you an FBI man?
