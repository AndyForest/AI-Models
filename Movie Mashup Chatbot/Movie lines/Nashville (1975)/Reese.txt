Okay, then we'll see you there.
Well, how about the shopping center?
It's on National television, Barnett.
That's what he wants.
Barbara Jean.
He has that sign with the tree.
He's going to run for president.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Have you talked to Triplette?
How is she?
I'll just be in here.
Let me know when you do, all right?
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
I'll be dammed.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Who?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
You always live there?
Where are you from?
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
He ain't really new.
You do?
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
No, we never did that
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
Where is she?
