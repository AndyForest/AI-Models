Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
They can come to the concert in the park.
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
His Word.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Okay. Thanks.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Oh, sure.
Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
Okay.
Sure thing.
D.C.
Minimum.
ABC.
President.
Hal Phillip Walker.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Might be good for you.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
You're real favorites of his.
Yes.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
He's pretty well known down here.
Glad to meet you.
Hello. John Triplette.
What?
Why?
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
Hello.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Ryan O'Neal.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Ah... Peter Finch.
I know a couple.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Southern California.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
He is to a lot of people.
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Oh --
You go to school together?
What do you think of him?
Pleasure
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
May I see your costume?
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
