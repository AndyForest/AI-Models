Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
What?
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
Don't feel that way, honey.
What's wrong honey.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
Your job, huh.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
I said 'no!'
What?
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Whose word?
How is that?
He knows better.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
She's fine.
Yes.
You bet.
What do you really want?
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
She's going to rest now.
Okay.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
You know better than that.
What!
What does he want?
Third party?
Who the hell is he?
Who the hell is he?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
