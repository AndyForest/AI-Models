Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
Hundreds of times.
Money's no object.
I can do benefits
You think it will?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
It's not bad.
You sure do it loud.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
Got me an audition tonight.
You bet.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
I see.
Oh, why thank you.
