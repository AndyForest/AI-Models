Okay.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Where'd he ever see us?
How much?
National television?
What's he running for?
Whose?
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
You want anything?  A drink?
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Yes, but we're just singing.
How come?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
When is it?
Bastard
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
What crook?
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Hey!
Where are you going?
Where the hell have you been?
