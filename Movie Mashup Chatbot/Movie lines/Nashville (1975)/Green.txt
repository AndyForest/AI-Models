Bye, Bye.
I got them right here.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
You going today?
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Green.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
You'll have to speak up.
Well, my wife, Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.	She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We've been following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I didn't mean to do that.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
Am I disturbing you?
What?
You want me to wait?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Hi, Sherry.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Good night,
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
A little. What do you need?
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
I think we can do that. Come in.
Can I help you?
Maybe you can look after me a little.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
What did you say?
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
I'1l get your bag.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
