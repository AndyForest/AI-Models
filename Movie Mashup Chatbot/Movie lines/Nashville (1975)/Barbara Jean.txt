You're so good.
All those people...
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Barnett?
You have to what?
Then why are you listening to her -
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Barnett, please -
I see.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
What did you say your name was?
What's wrong with her.
I said, I've been real tired.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
How did you come in here?
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
