Your wire Ester - she passed away.
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.

Mr. Green?
How'd you get in here.
Well, Mr. Green.
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
