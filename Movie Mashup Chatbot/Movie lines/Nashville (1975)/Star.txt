Come on.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Winifred.
I hate that music.
What?
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
Well, it better not happen again.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You got the money?
Get in.
You in music?
You got a place to stay?
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
Need a ride?
She had on high heels?
Have you seen a woman about so high?
