Andy...
You too.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Well, they are French.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
What?
No wonder he let her go.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
I know where he'll go.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
We don't both have to die.
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
Holy mother of God...
I hope they fucking fry us all.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Are you crazy!?
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
They're coming!
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
I don't know...
What makes you so sure this will work?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy! No!
I know. He told me.
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Are you okay?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
A la votre.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Don't you want to change?
What about your glasses?
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
So... you feel okay now?
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Andy! Holy shit!
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Andy!
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Uh-huh. Good for you.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Salots! Shitfucker!
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
You fucking liar!
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Andy!
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -
