Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Pull over! Now!
You on drugs? Huh?
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
