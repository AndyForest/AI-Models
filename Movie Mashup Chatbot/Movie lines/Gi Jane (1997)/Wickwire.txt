I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.

It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
