Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
K-R-O-one.
Sorry...
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Bob...
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Yes!
Bailey, Brackman.
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
In a word, Bob...
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
Thanks, Walter.
Because they deserve to, Walter.
Whatever.
I'm ready...
I'm not ready to die.
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
I'm not going to die.
What's that mean?!
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
I'm not going to close the--
What's wrong with you?
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
Jerk... What did you say?
I promise!
One hour!
You're not smiling.
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
A reaction to AZT...
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
Aren't you giving an exam?
Thanks, you guys.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
A carrot?!
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Honesty is always best.
I know that, Charles.
Of course.
Thanks, Charles.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
He's upset, he's sorry.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Sounds delightful.
About my blood work?
Thanks for coming by.
Sure thing.
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
A good start.
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
Yes.
Yes. On my torso.
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
No. I didn't.
I still am.
I suppose you could say that.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
Particularly, Charles.
I'll look over the Q and A.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
What happens?
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
What have you prayed for?
Do you... pray?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
Uh huh...
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
You survived your first gay party intact.
Correct.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
What do you want?
Let's find you a drink.
Not bad.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
It's me, you dork.
PARRTYY!
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Thank you.
No. They didn't fire her.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
Rayisha. Very nice.
What's her name?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
What?
Fine.
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
Thanks for your time.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
They sabotaged me.
Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
As in, the vegetable?
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
Makeup.
I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
My lover and I.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Nine.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Kids are great.
Congratulations.
New baby?
It's okay. Can I sit down?
I have AIDS.
Client of yours?
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
Rach.
No. I can't really see it.
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Absolutely.
That's right.
Yes.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Yes.
In some situations.
Some do. I didn't.
No.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
No.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Yes.
Yes.
Gay movies.
Not unnecessary ones.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
Something like that.
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
Mom?
Where's Dad?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
I'm fine.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
