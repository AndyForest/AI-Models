I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Ready for what, baby?
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Maybe you should think about it.
Maybe you should think about it.
No.
That's not what I said.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
Close the law book.
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
Fuck you.
We're not skipping this treatment.
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
Drew!
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
You're going to the office?!
Why are you getting dressed?
I am relaxed.
Don't apologize for me.
It could be parasites, an infection...
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
I said, don't worry about it.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
