Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody.
