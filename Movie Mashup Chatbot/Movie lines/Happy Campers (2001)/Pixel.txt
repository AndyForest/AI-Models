Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!

Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
That wants to be a Yes.
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
...sorry...
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down.  Either way, you come away with knowledge.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
Uh-huh.
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Nothing.
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
