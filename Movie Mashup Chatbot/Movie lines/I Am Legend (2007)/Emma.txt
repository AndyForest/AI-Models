You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Do you still want me to stay?
You want me to stay?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
I don't know.
Humans.
Yes.
I don't know.
Mine.
I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
You know what I mean.
What do you want?
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
Why don't you start with me?
You want to kill them.
You want to find them.
What?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Who is this?
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
We move.  Place to place.
With them?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
Yes.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
That is not now, human!
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
