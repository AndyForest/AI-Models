I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
I doubt it. She's just an...
I know.
Better than I can!
You cook very well!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
I'm *not* a doctor!
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
Sure. Thanks.
She knows how to take care of herself.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
"...did." Well, okay.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
I know, I'm sorry.
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
*What* will be okay?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Right.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
What's the *medical* explanation?
Oh, sure!
And what did she die of, exactly?
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
"King Kong". It's really good.
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
People watched the movies in their cars?
A movie *outside*?
I better go.
Okay...
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
Sure... I'll see you around.
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
I understand.
Oh...
Where's Mandalay?
I know.
I've never seen the ocean, either.
I've never seen a lobster.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
How many months are you?
So, Mrs...
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
That's true.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
They wanted a girl.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Uh... it's the end of October.
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Did you bite it?
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
What about the trees?
Migrants?
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
At what altitude?
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
It's all very normal.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
Where are you going?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Liberator...
What kind of plane are you flying?
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Right?
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
Where'd she get you?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
But she's your *daughter*...
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Is it true?
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
I guess so...
Okay...
Right.
So. What should I do now?
I am not a doctor.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
Of course.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
I'm happy I amuse you.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
I thought it was my turn.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
I don't think so.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Nobody's named this one yet.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
I haven't read that.
In other words, scurvy.
I don't know it.
It's obviously an aborticide.
It looks like scurvy.
There was no visible wound?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
Yes, for both.
Right.
Uh... sure.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
That's it.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
But you don't look very happy.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
You're not yet three months, are you?
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
You okay, Rose?
Almost.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
I'm not in trouble.
No trouble.
Do you like to read?
Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
It's just my heart.
Rose Rose?
