They're *outrageous*, them rules!
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
It look nicer then home!
We see you next harvest.
Sorry, Homer...
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
He ain't never been outta Maine!
She took off in the night!
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
