Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
We heard that one already, Homer.
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
I told him that you all is sick.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
*What* view?
What view?
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
She took off on the bicycle, man.
Rose Rose has runned away!
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
