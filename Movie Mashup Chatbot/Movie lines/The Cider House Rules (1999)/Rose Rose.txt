No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
I can't go nowhere.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Hi...
How is that Wally doing?
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
That's *it*?
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
So what?
What you got a picture of your heart for?
What's that?
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
What's lucky about that?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
