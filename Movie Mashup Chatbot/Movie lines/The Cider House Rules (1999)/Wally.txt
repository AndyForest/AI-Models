*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
Well, they aren't.
I never said they were boring.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
It's almost like flying.
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
They're migrants.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Actually, I volunteered.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
Really! Is it serious?
Have you enlisted?
A B-24 Liberator.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
It's okay--I don't mind.
