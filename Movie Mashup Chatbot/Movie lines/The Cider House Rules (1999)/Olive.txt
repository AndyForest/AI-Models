Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
When will he be home, Major?
Then it's malaria?
Why was he missing for twenty days?
