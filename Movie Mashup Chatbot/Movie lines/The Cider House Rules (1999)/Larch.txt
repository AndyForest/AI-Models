I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
I was!
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
Life is waiting.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Someone not from Maine.
No. She was an immigrant.
She looks after other people's children.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I don't need your gratitude.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
You do it then.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
It's my turn!
Where's the name sheet?
When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
Obviously.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
First pregnancy?
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
