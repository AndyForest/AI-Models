What's she so emotional about?
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
And that I can drive a truck!
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Why not?
I mean your parents.
I'm sorry, Homer.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
What are you going to tell the little ones?
What'd she die of?
