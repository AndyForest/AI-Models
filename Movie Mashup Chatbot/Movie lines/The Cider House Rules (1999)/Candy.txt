Good night, Daddy.
Daddy, *please*...
Good night, Daddy.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
It's time somebody ate *them*.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
Do you think she'll be all right?
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
Please don't...
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
Please don't make me say it again.
What do you want me to *do*?
He's *paralyzed*!
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
Stop it! Just cut it out!
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Nothing.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
You don't understand! It's her father...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Well, we have to help her!
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
It will be okay.
I *know* this was right.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Just a little privacy.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
You don't miss it?
At least you were never lonely.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
But you looked as if you liked it.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
So. Not bored yet?
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Burma!
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Really?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
Two.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
Why?
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
Yes, I *have*!
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
Hi...
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
I know what you've been doing.
I love you, Wally.
There! You said it was boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Wally thinks apples are boring.
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
I'm okay--I can walk.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
