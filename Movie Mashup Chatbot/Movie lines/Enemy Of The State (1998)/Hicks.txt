Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
We don't know.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
If they've looked at the video.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
No sir.
Yes sir.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
I just meant--
Sir--
He's clever. He had help.
He had help.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
We'd have to--
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
There was a transfer.
We found the originals.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
