Yes sir.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
For your wife?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Was he with anyone?
Anything at all?
Did he give you anything?
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Than why can't you tell me.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
You tell me.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
About the accident.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
A police report.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Your stuff?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
