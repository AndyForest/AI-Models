Who are you calling?!
Someone else?
Um...who's that?
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
I just gave him my card.
I'm telling you, I--
Nothing.
Nothing.
Yes.
<u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
Oh Jesus.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Brill?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
Really?
Told by whom?
I don't know who he is.
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.
What kind of a question is that?
Rachel Banks?
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Why?
Not particularly, no.
He came in four minutes ago.
What are you dialing?
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Pretty fast.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
No.
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
What if we just fucked with 'em?
What if--
What if--
What if--
Listen--
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
So what do we do now?
What about newspapers and magazines?
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
No he won't.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Tell me about it.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
That wasn't so hard.
Oh my God...
I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
You're driving.
Gimme that.
What the fuck?!
Why?
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
<u>Here</u>?!
Where?
Who?
What's going on?
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Yeah.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Looks like Detroit.
They come after you?
Why'd you leave?
Jesus.
How'd you have the manpower to--
How'd you get around the tap orders?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
How do you know so much?
I didn't use my name.
Sorry.
You told me no calls.
I called from a payphone!
I didn't use my name.
I called my wife!
Look, my wife is understandably--
What do you mean?
One-twenty.
We said a hundred.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
I'll pay you.
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
What if--
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
I don't know what that--
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
Wait. What do I do?
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
What <u>is</u> that?
Yeah.
Wait.
You're crazy.
The NSA?
What do they have to do with this?
Who are they?
Who was that other guy?
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
You got any money?
Hello. Hello, Maria.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
Okay.
Thanks.
Eight.  Size eight.
Pardon?
I'll say.
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
Is that good?
Can you help me?
Yes. I have her permission.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
I'm married.
Because my life is being ruined.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
That's my point.
I know, but--
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
To buy lingerie.
No.
Not that I could see.
No, sir.
No.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
Somebody took my blender.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Because I don't know.
I'm not his attorney.
I can't.
What kind of trouble.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
About what?
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
A report?
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
The robbery.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
Thanks.  Who are you?
Yes?
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
It's over.
That's gonna end tonight.
Yeah.
Oh Christ.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
That was for Christmas.
You opened the thing?
That's okay.
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
Stacy--
Well...yeah.
I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.  Please.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Is Eric in school?
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
It wasn't me.
I know.
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I know, but listen--
Stacy--
Stacy, don't hang up.
Stacy--
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
It's not real...  That's not me.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
I see her for business.
I know.
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
Yeah...look--
I've seen it.
It's not true.
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
Stacy?
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
Well, you know--
It's okay.
No.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
I saw a man die.
Something bad happened tonight.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Right.
Just for the criminals.
Not a very good one, but--
Uh-oh.
Hey.
Don't count on it.
My suitcase is gone.
My suitcase--
Here, you can use this.
It's a brand new card.
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
It's not?
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
I don't believe it is, no.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Actually, that's not true.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
Any idea what he looks like?
Yeah.
It's not me?
I'm sorry about that.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I <u>did</u> care how.
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
You have to.
Tell me about Brill.
I'm gonna fix it.
Rachel--
That's temporary.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
You being audited?
I know.
Will you hang on just a second.
Who's doing this?
You got a minute?
All right, look--
Why?
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
Thank you.
How can I be sure.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
Why would I--
Other than Brill.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
So you've said.
Brill?
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Brill.
When do I get to meet him?
Not that much.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
It tastes like fish.
Fuck you. You may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Fuck you. You may have to what?
Otherwise you may have to what?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
You're wrong.
He didn't.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
Who <u>are</u> you people?
Yeah?
You're Brill.
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Hey!
My shoe?
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Fuck off.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
You're firing me.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Brill.
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
Oh, well, that's true.
I don't under--
Listen--
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
I have to go lingerie shopping.
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
Good point.
Why?
What are you talking--
Where's Stacy?
No "900" numbers.
It's okay to use the phone.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Do I know you?
Where's mom?
You staying for dinner?
In your dreams.
Sure, go ahead.
Some of 'em.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Go fuck yourself.
Jerry?
Yeah?
No. No, it's okay.
So do I!
Go to 'em, Jerry.
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
No, I--
You gotta--
Jerry--
I don't know!
I don't know. I mean--
They're framing me.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Yes.
They killed Rachel.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Ssh!
Jerry--
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Into what?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
Table 122?
Serve the ball.
What?
No, but they took my blender.
I love my blender.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
No.
No.
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
Yeah, what's going on?
Are you okay?
Tell me about it.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
It's been a few years.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
I don't know.
I honestly don't know.
He got hit by a bus.
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
The police?
Why not?
You would?
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
