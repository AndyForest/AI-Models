We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
I said fuck you.
Fuck you.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
What the hell does it mean?
