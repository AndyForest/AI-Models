Where to now, Jimbo?
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
I got you covered.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Step into my office.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Hey - the world is my office.
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
