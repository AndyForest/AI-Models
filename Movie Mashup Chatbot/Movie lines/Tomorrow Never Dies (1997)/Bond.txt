I'd rather die alone.
What about the gold?
- Instant melt-down.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
I'm sure they will.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Briefly.
...Words to live by?
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
And still not a thing to watch.
So why did you leave?
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
Sightseeing.
I can feel your pain.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
I see.
Sir Elliot.
I'm on my way.
How did you get this number?
We'll see about that.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Where can I find him?
I appreciate your time -
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
I'm sorry.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
What - no lust for adventure?
- We all want what we can't have?
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
- Four wheel drive?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Q! How are you?
I know what I saw -
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Wait a minute -
Yes -
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Paris -
Shhhhh...
What about the uranium?
Do you?
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Nothing.
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Is this another one of your games?
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Political considerations?
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
I see...
Does it work on cash machines?
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
... Shoelaces?
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Fishing?
How is old Q?
It must do something.
Come on. I know better than that -
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Sidney Winch, meet -
That's reassuring.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
Who knows? Fog, night...
He tied one on.
Can you arrange a meeting?
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
She married a hockey player.
Natalya?
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Let's take a look at the body.
That's reassuring.
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
Thanks.  Take care -
No.
... Kids?
Married?
Depends what number you write.
Of course.
They point, I shoot.
Interesting presentation.
And when might that be?
And number two?
... Yes?
... Yes???
I didn't say when I want to die -
Sleep well?
We blast through.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Sometimes you just have to -
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Trust me.
Up.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Not a lot of difference.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Wait here.
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
He's killed closer.
Blood or Dutch?
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
... Do you have a gun?
Why don't we just take these -
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
If I were you -
- The family jewels?
I hope you'll be gentle.
I hope so.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
Nice to run into you again.
I'll keep that in mind.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Boyfriend?
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
It doesn't quite add up.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Sorry I'm late -
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
I understand.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
Of course.
... What's Harmsway done?
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Yes, M.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Remind me.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
... And what do you call these?
