Just - say it. Say it just once.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Just hold me.
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Do you feel better now?
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Is that any way to say hello?
