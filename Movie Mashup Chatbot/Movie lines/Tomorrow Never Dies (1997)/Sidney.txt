Now.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
Next time, I do the driving.
If not?
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Don't say it.
... We have time for that?
Are you listening to me?
What now? And don't give me some movie clichï¿½ like 'trust me.'
Down?
What the hell does that do?
What do you mean?
My father left me the business.
No. I'm going with you.
This has got to be a mistake.
You are seriously deranged.
He was my father's best friend!
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
What?
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
- You're not.
And what do you call this?
Think about mom.
Do I have to do everything around here?
So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
No?
- Shut up!
Let's not make it a habit.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Sidney Winch.
Have we met?
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Bourbon. Neat.
You won't get away with this!
No.
I was an attorney!
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
What's your name?
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
I am. What do you want?
My timing always was lousy.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
He brought that up from the wreck.
- I told you! He was there! -
What is HE doing here?
