We met, this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
Are you finished?
I could fight you on this.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Now, look...
Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
The stock will turn.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Projections were far too optimistic.
