How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
And, they didn't take that watch?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
Have you gone to the police?
Robbed?
It always is.
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
