Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Yeah.
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
You're part of it...
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
Really?
Okay... okay.
How do you know?
It's them.  They did this.
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
You dodged a bullet.
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
I know...
Do it for YOU.
It doesn't matter...
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
Why would you say that?
But, will you?
Will you?
Tell me you'll call.
Call them.  Trust me.
It's a profound life experience.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Call that number.
For you.
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
No.
Yeah.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Elizabeth?
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
Happy Birthday, man.
Hey there, Nickie.
