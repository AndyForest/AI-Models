There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
