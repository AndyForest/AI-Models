Goodnight.  See you home.
Nobody worried about your father.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Not much, I think.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
What makes you ask?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Goodnight then.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Is everything alright?
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
You did?  How is he?
Dinner's in the oven.
Have a nice day.
