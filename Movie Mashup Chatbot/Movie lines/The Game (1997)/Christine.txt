Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Then, you kiss his ass.
Always.
No.
Yes.
Julliard, yeah.
One brother, one sister.
Originally, Connecticut.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
I have to get to the airport...
Claire.
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
I have to show you...
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Let me show you...
Nicholas...
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
We searched the house.
Where'd you get that gun?
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
Where'd you get that... ?
They won't...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
What do you think you're doing?
Nicholas...
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
It's out of your hands.
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
Who is it?
Who is it?
I don't know.  A lot.
What?
All I mean is... someone like you...
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
What did you say?
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
What are you doing... ?
God, wake up, it's a con!
Nicholas...
Not here!  They can see.
They're watching.
I don't...
What's wrong?
Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
Want anything to drink?
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Okay.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Where'd you get this?
What is it?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
It's okay, dad.
What are you doing here?
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Right.  Call me Christy.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Nice.
What exactly do you do?
Where are we going?
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
That's classic.
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
Never did catch your name.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
They'll love that.
What's C.R.S.?
I'll wait.
My hero.  Let's go.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
No.
You pull me up.
You first.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
If there was one.
Why not?
Never mind.
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
Home.
See you around.
There's got to be a flashlight.
You should be.
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
What are you talking about?
A game?
What... is... happening... ?
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
What <u>is</u> your problem?
He's turning blue!
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
Don't just stand there, get help!
Do you know what to do?
What's with him?
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Oh, no... you.
I said I was sorry...
It was an accident.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
I'm so sorry.
