Like, this way... sort of...
It was a different floor then...
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
You don't need me...
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.

May I make two suggestions... ?
We provide whatever's lacking.
It's different every time.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Oh... it's a game.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Oh, here we go...
