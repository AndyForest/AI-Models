Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
What about the house?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
You're joking.
Nothing else?
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
You know you can.
How concerned should I be?
Nicholas...
What's happened...
I checked it personally.
Attractive...
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Anything wrong... ?
