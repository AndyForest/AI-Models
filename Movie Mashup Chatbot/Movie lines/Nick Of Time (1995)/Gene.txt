Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
What?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Huh?
Sorry.
San Diego.
Business.
Uh, yes..
What?
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
Same to you.
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
Can we go now?
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
For what?
This? I've never even fired one.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
No.
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
That's right.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
I have a problem.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
I appreciate that.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
I...
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
I need your help.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
I want'to talk to her.
Let me talk to her again.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
No, please...
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
How am I supposed to get away?
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
I kill her - and you kill me.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
I killed you.
You killed him.
How should I...?
He's dead?
What...?
What would you do in my place?
Then I have time for a drink.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
The gun...
Where did you get these? Who are you?
This says "invitation only".
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
I will do no such thing.
You're out of your mind.
Yes, I'm listening.
Yes, yes, I understand.
You wouldn't...
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
I'd like to know what...
Yes.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
What?
We have to hurry.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
I think you better put that away.
Okay...
But...
Are you sure?
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
No, that's,..that's fine
No. Kisses to you.
All right. Kisses to you.
Will you promise me that?
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
I know you do, honey.
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
Over and out.
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
Lynn!
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Let' s do it.
Ready?
How did you see us kiss?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
We made it.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
Thanks for the shine.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
I don't know.
What am I supposed to say to her?
What!?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Hi.
Keep the change.
What are you going to do?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Kill the Governor.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
That's right.
What?
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Please...
Please. Something is going to happen...
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
You remember me?
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Keep it.
Keep it.
Is within himself.
I said I have to do something.
I have to do something.
I'm just an accountant.
