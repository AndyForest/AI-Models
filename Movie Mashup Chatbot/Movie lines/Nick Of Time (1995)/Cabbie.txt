Oh, yeah?
The grave. Somebody close?
Somebody close?
Aw, too bad.
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
'S okay. What do you think?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
Where'd you come from?
Business or pleasure?
You just come in on Amtrack?
Amtrack?
Where to, sir?
