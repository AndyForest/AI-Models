You sent my assistant on an errand.
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
All right, I'll do it.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
Don't remind me.
What's he doing here?
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
Good luck.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
For not believing you.
I would also like to apologize.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Indeed.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
What the hell are you saying?
What?
Who did?
You shot her?
How do you know that?
You were very nervous.
I remember you...in the elevator.
Ah.
That's...a comfort to hear.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
My security people are right next door.
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
Yes?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
