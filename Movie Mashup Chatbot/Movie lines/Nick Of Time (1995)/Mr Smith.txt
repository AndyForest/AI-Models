You know what I'm gonna do.
Don't you threaten me.
Forget about it.
No.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
That's right. That gives you...
Again.
Come back.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
Keep your voice down.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
You fucked up.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
Tell me why he's dead.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
Tell me why I miss him.
Me?
You get another chance in ten minutes.
You...
What about the gun?
Are you 'fucking with me!?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
What's your point?
She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
Good.
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
Daddy?
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Come with us, sir.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Could I see some identification, sir?
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Shut up.
Help me get her off the rug.
It's under control.
Yeah.
Just put her on.
Put her on.
Come Back.
Do it!
That's enough.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
You're wasting time.
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
And what happens if I don't call you?
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
Foreigners! Fuck!
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Right there.
I'm looking for them.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
