Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Mother!
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
I'd love to.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Mom, I need to talk to you.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Mother, I ...
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
I don't want to talk about it.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
Behind the books.
Mother!
What pictures?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
I'm good.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
Uh-huh?
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
You don't like where I live?
So, what do you think?
