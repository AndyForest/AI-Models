You want to come inside?
Is there something else I can do for you?
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Who told you we deal drugs?
We like to think so, yeah.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
I just need to use the phone, lady.
