Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
And you don't deal drugs?
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Have a nice day.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Mm hmm.
I can make my own decisions.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Mm hmm.
I'm sorry.
Aaron?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
What's wrong?
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
You know, you never tell me anything.
He seemed quite taken with you.
But I was dusting.
Well, they were right out in plain view.
You know ...  ... whoops!
What about the fellow in those pictures?
Dating anyone?
How are you doing sweetheart?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
... What are they all doing there?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
He's an organic farmer.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Who is it?
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
I see.  How much?
This way?
You mean it's dangerous?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
