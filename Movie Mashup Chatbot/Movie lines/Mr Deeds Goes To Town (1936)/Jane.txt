He's still pixilated.
Oh, yes.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
He sure is pixilated.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
And sings.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Pixilated.
They think he's pixilated.
Most every day.
He was a seven-months baby.
Since he was born.
