I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
That tuba player!
Look!
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
I can't find him.
See you later, kid.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
That's pretty.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney�
Wants to know who the heir is.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
What about your knocking off for lunch?
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing�
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
Are those stories true?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Uh-huh.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Have a drink?
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Nah.
Why should you?
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
