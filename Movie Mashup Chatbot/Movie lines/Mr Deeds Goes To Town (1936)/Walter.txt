Shall I call the police, sir?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Me, sir?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
What, sir?
But she's on the telephoneï¿½
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
You have no pants, sir.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
Oh, I do too, sir.
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Every man to his taste, sir.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Tails tonight, sir?
