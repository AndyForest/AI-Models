It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
You're crazy! You can't do that!
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
What're you going to do?
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he�
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That�"
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
What's bothering you, huh?
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Sure.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
When're you going to see him again?
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
How'd you get the picture?
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Is he really that big a sap?
Did it?
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Uh-huh.
With pay!
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have�
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
