Would you like to go for a walk?
Why not?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
No. Are you?
Yes!!!
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, thank you!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain�
Yes, but I�
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
NO!!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes.
No! I resigned last week!
No!
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Oh, hello darling.
Yes, of course.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
A girl?
No, I don't mind.
I don't blame you.
Are you? When?
Let's just walk, okay?
Thank you.
Ready?
I'll get my hat.
You threw them out!
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
I'd like to read it some time.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
It had better be good.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Yeah, I know.
He played in the town band, too.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
I've often thought about going back.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
What did you mean by that?
You said I was a lady in distress.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
Here's a nice place.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Why don't you try?
There's Times Square.
Now, what do you see?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
Yeah, let's.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Uh-huh.
What are they going to do?
What did they say?
What did they say?
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
I enjoy it.
Oh, I don't mind.
Really?
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
What?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Hello.
We're not going out tonight.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Yeah, then what?
Why? Why do we have to do it?
I'm crucifying him.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Good night.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Don't be ridiculous.
No. It's nothing.
Nothing.
Hello . . .
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
That's the rub.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Yes.
Last night he proposed to me.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
Had the boys follow us.
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Have lunch.
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
With pay!
Can I have a month's vacation?
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Look, I can do it!
