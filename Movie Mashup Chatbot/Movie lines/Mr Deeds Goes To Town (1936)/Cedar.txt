Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Yes, I�
Yes.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Good morning.
You are , aren't you?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
That's all, Miss Bennett.
And you saw them happen?
But they did take place?
Are they true!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Are these the articles?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Your Honor!
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
Nuisance value?
Relatives of old man Semple.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
Thank heaven.
But your honor�
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
It's a lie!
Your Honor, I object.
What was that you said he was?
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
This is outrageous!
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
What?
You can't?
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Hang up.
Hang up.
Newspaperman?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie�
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N�
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Yes. That is to say�
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
No?
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Will you have a cigar?
You're going to New York with us.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Are your parents living?
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
How do you do.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
No, thanks.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
