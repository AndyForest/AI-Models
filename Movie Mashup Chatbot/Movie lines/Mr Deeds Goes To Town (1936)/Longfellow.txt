I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
That's going to be fun.
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Who are you?
Next, please.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Any children?
Are you married?
Hello, Mary?
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Mary - I - excuse me�
Well, here we are again.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
In a day or so, I think.
Mary, I'm going home.
All right.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
Sure!
He did?
What did he play?
He did? I play the tuba�
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
You have?
Gosh! What do you know about that!
Really?
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]  Except you, of course.  People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live  Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
Oh, I don't know.
Nothing�
Oh, that�
What's that?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President�  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
That depends on what they see.
Huh?
It's wonderful.
Yes.
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff�
Have you seen the papers?
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if�
Sure. I met you.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
No. That is, I didn't�  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though�  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Oh - uh - nothing.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Tell me more about yourself.
Feel better now?
What happened?
Look, this is my house. I'd like to�
You fainted.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Perfect! Perfect!
Yes.
Sit over there, will you?
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Is that the best you've got?
Fourteen carat?
Gold, eh?
How's it going? Okay?
You try it.
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
Why not? Who is he?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Huh?
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
No, thank you.
When?
What for?
Who - me? No.
Buffer?
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to�
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Why, no.
Yes.
All right.
How do you do.
Yes.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
They can have the Estate.
Shut up!
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to�
Sometimes it's the only solution.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Oh, they insisted on following me.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Arthur wants to quit!
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Oh.
What're you talking about?
Entertainment?
Only common sense.
That's funny. Why is that?
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
No, thanks.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Huh?
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
I've got one for Cobb�
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.
Why not?
Now, where were we?
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Me?!
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
We own an opera house, don't we?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
I'm Chairman.
I'm Chairman?
Well, thanks, I - uh�  How do you do? What is your name?
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Let him alone.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Oh. That.
Huh?
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
A child? My uncle's?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Mrs. Semple?
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
No.
Well, I play the tuba.
Well, I don't know. I�
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Thank you, Your Honor.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I�
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Your Honor�
Oh, the poet? Where?
I write poetry.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
That ought to be fun.
Binge?
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
Now you keep out of this!
Don't pay any attention to her.
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
Who are they?
Oh. Oh!
South Dakota - north?
Where is your farm?
Farmer?
What is your name?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Is Mary home?
Is she home?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
No!  What do you want!!
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Yeah.
You try it.
Hey, did you hear that?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Who?
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Looking for?
Please!
What two policemen?
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
I did what!
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
Prairie? Oysters?
What's that?
I just wanted to make sure.
You're Walter, aren't you?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
What do you think you're doing?
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
