Let me go!
I wanna see that guy!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
�my wife wanted me to tell you she�  �she prays for you every night.
Oh, Mr. Deeds�
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
