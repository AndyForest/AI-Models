Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
It's time to go home now.
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
No more stalling, Captain.
That isn't the way it works.
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
Now... you go home.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
Am I one... or many?
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
Many others.
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
That's my scientist.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
Talk to him.
Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
