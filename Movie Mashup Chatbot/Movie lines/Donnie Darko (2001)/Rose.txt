It feels wonderful.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
That is a terrible nickname.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
When did you stop taking your medication?
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
If that's what you think is necessary.
I... What can we do?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Frank?
Come again?
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
He was a year ahead of us?
What?
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
Our son just called me a bitch.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
It is a big deal.
How did you know --
That's enough.
Excuse me?
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
But now you can't go.
Beg pardon?
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Kitty...
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
