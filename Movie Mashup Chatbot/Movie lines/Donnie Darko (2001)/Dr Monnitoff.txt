Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
I'm not following you.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Beg pardon?
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
A metal craft of any kind.
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Theoretically.
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
Donnie.
