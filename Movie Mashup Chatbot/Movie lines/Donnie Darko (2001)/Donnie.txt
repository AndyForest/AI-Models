Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Like a spear.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Like a DeLorean.
So... that's it?
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
Dr. Monnitoff?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Not until like... eighth grade.
Our saviour...
Dea ex machina...
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
I didn't say shit.
How much longer is this gonna last?
Why do they call you Frank?
What happened to your eye?
Take it off. I want to see you.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
You have to do something for me first.
Where did you come from?
Who is... we?
Why did you make me flood the school?
How can you do that?
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
I don't wanna talk about it.
We went to a hotel.
Yeah...
No. Frank.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Come with me.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
It's safe here.
Did you call the cops?
But you're OK?
Where is she?
Hey. You OK?
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Will you please talk to me?
What do you mean?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
The whole movie. Let's go.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
So, we call them... IMGs.
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
They suspended me for two days.
We're moving through time.
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
That's alright... I understand.
Well...
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
With, like, images?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
Why?
Yeah?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
Where are you going?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Will you go with me?
I'm sorry.
We never would have had this conversation.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
What makes you think I'm not?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Wow. Did he go to jail?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
So... you just moved here?
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Sure.
School's cancelled.
Hey...
People aren't that simple.
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Do you get to meet Ed?
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
Grandma Death.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
You're such a fuck-ass.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
I know, Dad.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
Grandma Death.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Where it came from?
Do they know yet?
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Cellar door.
What's "Cellar Door"?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Where are you going?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Why should we care?
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Thank you.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
I can see him right now!
Frank is going to kill.
Soon. Time is almost up.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
I have the power to build a time machine.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Because I'm so horny.
I think now that he might...
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
That I did it again.
Regret.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Yes. I went to jail.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
People get hurt.
I... I was playing with fire.
Yes.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Nothing.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Four times... so far.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
I think about girls a lot.
Yes.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I met a girl.
Yes.
No.  That's stupid.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
He said to follow him.
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
Don't you watch the news?
I think he saved my life.
His name is Frank.
So, I met a new friend.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Everything is going to be just fine.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Congratulations.
Her name is Gretchen.
I was just being honest.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Because you tell Mom everything.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Yeah.
Guess who wrote it?
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
Gerald.
How much are they paying you to be here?
