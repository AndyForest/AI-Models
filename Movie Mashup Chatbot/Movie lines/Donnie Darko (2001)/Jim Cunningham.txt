Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
Are you AFRAID?
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Good morning, mongrels!
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
