Yeah.
What was his name?
What happened?
Hi... what's going on here?
Is that a cellar door?
Who's Frank?
Why? Is this about the book?
Where are we going?
What?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
My mom is gone.
Hey.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
What's wrong with you?
What? How long was I asleep?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Infant Memory Generators.
Maybe she's asleep.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Who?
Are you okay?
What?
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
You want to kiss me...
And what?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
What happened to your neck?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Donnie?
And you'd never been there before?
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
I'm going home.
Sure.
Where are we going?
That was a compliment.
You're weird.
Why is that?
Until it withers away.
Wonder where we'll be then.
You mean soap?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Fuck them.
Don't look so freaked.
Wanna walk me home?
Hey...
