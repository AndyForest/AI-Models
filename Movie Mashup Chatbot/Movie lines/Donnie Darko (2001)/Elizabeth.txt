That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.

It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Why would I tell Mom?
What's her name?
So I hear you have a girlfriend.

Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
Donnie? You're a dick.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
