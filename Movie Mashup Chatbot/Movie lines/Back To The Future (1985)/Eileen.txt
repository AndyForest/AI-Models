I think I know exactly what you mean.
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
Hi, Marty!
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
But he didn't ask me.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Then you'll be going to school here....?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
You remember me...?
Hi, Marty.
Have we ever met before?
Poly-what?
Here's your jacket!
Seventeen.
I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
That's good.
Learn anything?
How was school today?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
How are you?
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
