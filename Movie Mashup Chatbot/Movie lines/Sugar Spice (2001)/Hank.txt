Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
Bullets.
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Yeah?
Maybe we can make a deal.
That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Really...
