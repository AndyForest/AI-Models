Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
It's twins!!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Cleo!
You just became a statistic!
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Well...
... I don't know.  Probably not.
No.
And they get caught!
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
Positive.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Diane?  Diane!
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Definitely old.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
Stop it!  This is crazy!
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
