Oh... What are you working on?
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Y'think?
Yeah.
Spit from your dad?
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
