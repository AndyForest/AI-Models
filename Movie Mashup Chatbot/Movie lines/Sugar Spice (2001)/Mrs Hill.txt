Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Now how the hell can I help you?
My what?
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
