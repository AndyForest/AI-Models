"Your movie"?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
OUR picture?
Isn't he dead?
Lugosi?
Who?
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Tits.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
So you're not a fruit?
Are you a fruit?
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preï¿½sold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Can I help you?
