You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
What other sixty-thousand?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
