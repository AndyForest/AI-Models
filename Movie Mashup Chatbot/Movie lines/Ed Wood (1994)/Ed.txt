I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
Perfect.
And, cut...
That's great.  Let's do a take.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Soon, Bela... Soon.
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
What happened?!
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
Don't worry.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Don't you have any savings?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
What are you doing?
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Huh?
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
But maybe not.
So why didn't you do it?
Really?
Yeah, I did.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
What is this place?
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
You'll be sitting on the right.
You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
Bela, are you ready?
We didn't make a dime.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
Don't worry.  I'll do something.
What's in the needle?
I don't know how to make goulash.
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
Should I call a doctor?
Let me take you to the hospital.
Bela, what happened?!
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
Of course!
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Are you sure this is okay?
Do you want me to get it for you?
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
I never thought of that.
The <u>women</u>?
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
But you're a big star!
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
Don't you bave a car?
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Really?
Why were you buying a coffin?
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
No.  I don't work here.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
If you say so.
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
I've never seen anything like him!
Jesus!  Are you serious?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
I don't know.  Where?
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
What do you mean?
Sound!
Um, okay... roll camera
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
What do you think you're doin'?!
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
This is the big moment...!
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
It's that easy?
I don't understand.
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
H-how'd you know?!
Edward Wood, Sir.
Wow.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Isn't he?
Will he be okay?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
But you used to say --
Did you really mean those things you said..?
Dolores, wait!
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
That's right...
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
Does she have room for me?
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
<u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Goddamn landlord.
The secretary.  Or the file clerk.
But there's plenty of other parts.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
I'm no good.
Exactly.
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
It takes me comfortable.
It's a damn good role.
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
This is my way of telling you --
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
No!  A horror movie star!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Dolores, give me your shoes.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
I kinda need it now.
Yeah.  Exactly!
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
For this one, we need $60,000.
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
I understand you just moved here?
Well, uh, if I could I would...
That's not true --
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
Mr. Reynolds!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
I like to think so.
And PERFECT.  CUT!
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Raising money is tough.
You could say that --
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
Yeah...?
Hruphh...?
We're escaping!
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Tor, I should be getting home.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
I think you're quite handsome.
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
So, Mr. Johnson --
Oh, of course!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Excuse me, Sir...?
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Maybe it needs special handling.
Why not??
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
Um, I guess --
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
I don't think he's a schmuck.
There's still a sex-change --
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Is there a script?
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
Let's get married.
C'mon!  Let's just go.
I can't get it to go up.
Who's Dr. Tom?
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
Yeah...  I should give her a call.
Those assholes.
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
Bela died.
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
Stop!
Okay?
No! I love sex with girls.
I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
What do you mean?
Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
I just picked them up on the way over...
Not good...
I am.  How's your father?
Oh, hi.
How long's he been here?
What are you making?
The marriage already ended.
I got married last night.
Hello.
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
You don't wanna be noticed?
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
I'm really sorry...
It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
You know, to make the legs move --
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
YES!  JUST DO IT!
Yes!
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Yeah...?
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
I'm directing.
NOOOOO!!!
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
No, he would've loved it!  Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula.  CUE VAMPIRA!
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
I do.
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
