Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
I'm going to my mother's.
You're a fuckin' mess.
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
I told you this was gonna happen.
Like <u>what</u>?!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
That's ridiculous.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Toss us out on our ass.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Oh, just like in the script!
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
How long have you been doing this?
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
So did you get his autograph?
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
I thought he was dead.
You met Basil Rathbone!
Boris Karloff!?
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
Better than not getting a job?
You got the job?!!
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Ed, it was only one review.
What?
