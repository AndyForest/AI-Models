Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Really?!  Well good for you.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
