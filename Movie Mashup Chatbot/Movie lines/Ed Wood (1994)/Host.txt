"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
