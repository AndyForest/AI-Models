Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count...
Uh, beg to differ.
It is my home.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
No.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
No.  I never drink -- wine.
It's a pleasure...
No problem.  I know it by heart...
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Last night was quite a romp.
Sorry...
Eddie, how was I?
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Formaldehyde.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
I was thinking about killing myself.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Why are you here??
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Don't let me slow you down.
After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me.
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
Goddamn, it's cold!
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Eddie, you screwed up.
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
"Dear, you're lovely."  "Strap her to the table."
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Mmph?  Where am I?
So how'd we do?
I never said I could ad-lib...
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
"It is my home."
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Goulash.
Nah.  This happens all the time...
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
I didn't feel well...
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Dracula?
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
That's good.  I could use the money.
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
Who do I play?
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
I am always on time.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
I don't understand.
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
I have no next picture.
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
Thank you.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andï¿½truck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Ha!
Who are you?  What do you want?
Huh?
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
