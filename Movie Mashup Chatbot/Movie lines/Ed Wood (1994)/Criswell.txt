I predict we're lost.
YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
I guessed.
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
And who may you be?
