Yeah - sure!
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
You here again? What do you want?
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
What about?
Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything�
Get out, get out!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Fifty thousand dollars!
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Got a handkerchief?
John, how's your wife this morning?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Happy now?
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Ho! Ho! Ho!
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn�
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Good morning, Helen.
Numbers? No, never mind.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Now don't you worry about it.
Where is he now?
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Directors, eh? Long faces?
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Helen!
All right. Send him in.
Yes?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Hello, Helen.
Got my letter?
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
You haven't got a uniform?
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
You're protecting somebody.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
There you are.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
You're lying!
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they�
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
What time did this thing happen?
Yes.
Why pick on him ?
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Don't you think I know it?
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Mine too?
Did you get the case for the securities?
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
What are you talking about?
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
