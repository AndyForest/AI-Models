And tell him not to delay.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust�
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes�
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Say, you can't do that�
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
What do you mean, help?
We'll discuss that in the board room.
We want to talk to you.
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Just pure luck!
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
