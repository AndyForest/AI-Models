Why, Matt!
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals�  I think I will have a drink.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
What's this?
Cyril!
Why, Cyril, you're insane�
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
What?
No.
Why are you so anxious?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Well, what?
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
See, we're getting along famously!
Doesn't that come next?
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
�running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks�
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Me?
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
No.
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night?
Well . . .
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Yes, of course.
The theatre?
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Yes.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Hello, darling.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
