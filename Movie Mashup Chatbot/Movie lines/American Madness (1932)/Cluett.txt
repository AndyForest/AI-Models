He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she�
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
You understand?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
That's very simple. I was home.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't�
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
know, but�
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
What do you mean?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I�
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
I'm sorry, Dude, but�I�
I haven't got it.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
What are you doing here?
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
A misunderstood bachelor.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Good for you. Come on.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
My apartment.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer�
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
I want to be near you!
Don't you know?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Well�
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Line?
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
What is?
Well, you can. You always could.
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Why, I needed a�
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
I'm not interested in what you think.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
I'm listening.
Oh, yeah?
Yes, now.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
