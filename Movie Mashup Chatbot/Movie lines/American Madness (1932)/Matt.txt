And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
I remember once when your account checked.
What's the matter, Charlie?
Where you been?
Aw, nerts!
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I�
Charlie!
Let me have ten bucks?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Here's twenty-five thousand.
It was more than that last week.
How much?
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Now?
Yes, sir.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson�
But I haven't . . .
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and�
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is�
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
No. I won't.
I can't tell you.
I already told him I was home.
Well, I�
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Sure, I think it's swell.
It's all right. Thanks.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
They must have turned him down.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
All right, dear.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that�
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Oh, Charlie again.
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
I tell you, I saw them!
Well, he was making love to her.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Yeah.
Yeah, swell.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Oh, ten dollars�
With what?
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Why?
Hello, Helen!
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Yes.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Yes.
I don't know.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
wasn't anywhere near this place�
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Where's Charlie?
Everybody in?
Bought himself a pocketbook!
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
You've got enough?
How are you fixed?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
