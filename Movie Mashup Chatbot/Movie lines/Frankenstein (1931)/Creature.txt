Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
And he drove me to mine.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
I was watching.
You were with him at the end.
I am afraid.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
Yes. Very close
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Worse.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Better that way... for me.
Nice.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
She's beautiful.
That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
You will honor your promise to me!
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
A brain. Extremities.
Her body pleases me.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
Soon?
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Your crime... as well as mine.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Kill you? Hardly that.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Come warm yourself if you like.
