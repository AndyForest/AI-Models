Professor?
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Let it go.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
What happened up there?
For what?
Quite a place.
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
How much longer?
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
That's blasphemy!
You can't. Death is God's will!
You're making a scene!
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
They'll hang him all the same.
They just caught the man who did it.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
Somebody has to!
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
Now you've got him started.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
Can you think of a better reason?
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
I know. You have a way of making an impression.
Henry Clerval.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
As a march hare.
I was just clearing my throat.
