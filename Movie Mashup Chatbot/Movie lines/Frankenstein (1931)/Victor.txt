SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
She's not for you.
I will not! Kill me now!
No. I draw the line.
This was not taken from a grave.
What is this?
Why... her?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
And if I consent?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Friend?
What can I do?
I don't know.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Materials. Nothing more.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
I see it before me.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Kill me and have done with it.
How did you find me?
You speak.
Open this door for no-one!
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
Now husband and wife.
I do. But you must trust me for now.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
So do I.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
I've no choice
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Your decision. For us.
You make me weak.
Only you.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
I wish to be your husband.
This feels... incestuous.
I've loved you all my life
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
I'll have to do better than that.
And you?
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
The world is a dizzying place.
God took her from us.
What kind of God is He to will this?
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Nothing can. Not ever.
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
I owe you that. Done.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
I didn't find what I was looking for.
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
Thank you, Henry.
No. They don't.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
You've been going round-the-clock?
Is that your diagnosis?
A... week?
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
Yes? And?
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
I've been preoccupied.
No. He had more important work.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
I resent God's monopoly.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
Only you would think of that!
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
It's a letter to my father.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
Quite a few.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Do you really think I'm mad?
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Are you having me on?
I am not mad.
Very well then.
Despite the lack of challenge.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
The strain was evident.
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
Why?
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
Preposterous.
No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Professor Waldman.
My name is Frankenstein...
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
Do you share my madness?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Creature? A... human like creature?
I heard.
Ah. An explorer.
How is it you come to be here?
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
I'm... dying.
