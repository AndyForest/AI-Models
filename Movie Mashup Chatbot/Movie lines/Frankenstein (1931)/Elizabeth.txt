Are you all right?
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
I should go. I should leave today.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Nothing. Still nothing.
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
And you look so lovely.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
There, there... shhh...
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Is he not back yet?
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Victor!
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Brother and sister no more.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
It is
Why the change? What about your work?
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
What sort of task?
I thought I'd never see you again!
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
Victor. I love you,
I give you my soul...
Our decision. Together.
Not as weak as I.
I will be here when you return.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I wish to be your wife.
Brother and sister still?
Is that what makes it so delicious?
All my life I've known.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
Father's so proud.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Aren't you?
