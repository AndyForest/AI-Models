Hello?
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
Yes. The John Doe Party.
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
No, no, no�that's your seat.
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
And, Miss Mitchell�I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er�  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
How much money do you get?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell�I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Why�uh�
Well?
Huh? Get what?
I want it as soon as possible.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people�they ought to run you out of the country�and I hope they do it!
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Did you write it�or didn't you?
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Were you paid for it�or weren't you?
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Is there anything wrong?
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people�
