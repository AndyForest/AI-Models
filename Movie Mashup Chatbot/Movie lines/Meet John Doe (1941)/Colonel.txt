Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
He's watching the other door.
I ain't seen him for a week.
No.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
That's�
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
I know why you're hangin' around�you're stuck on a girl�that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
All right. You're walking along�not a nickel in your jeans�free as the wind�nobody bothers you�hundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of business�shoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
The heelots!
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
The heelots!
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!

The elevators are still runnin'.
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goods�a fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you�it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither!
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
