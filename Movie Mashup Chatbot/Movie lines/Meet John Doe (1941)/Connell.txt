Now listen, Ann�he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday�here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled�the Governor's starting a libel suit�what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney�and they insist on seeing him.
Awwwww!
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Okay, fellows.
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Well, maybe you're right.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
All right, boys, here he is.
Right here. Sit down.
Hurry up, Pop.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
I wish he had a family, though.
Looks all right�
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
I can read. I can read!
What bonus?
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
Who, for instance?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
What John Doe?
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
So?
A deal?
What John Doe?
In what man!
You made it up.
Say that again.
We'll get a handwriting expert to�  What!
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
The letter from John Doe.
The letter.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers�start arguments.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
. . . Tubby?
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
What do they want?
What?
Beany!
Shut up!
Hello! . . . Yeh?
Go out and find her!
Did you find her?
Where is she?
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
Listen, pal�this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself�I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson�and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter�are you falling? Come here.
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Yes. Sure.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Well, I'm stuck with two and two�but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Well, I don't get it.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for�
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear�and in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies�but stay out o' newspaper business!
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
How?
What's your name?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
How about family? Got any family?
What are you doing up here then?
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
