I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull.  Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it?
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
Is there a crowd in the street?
Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
Out the window! Something just flew by!
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
