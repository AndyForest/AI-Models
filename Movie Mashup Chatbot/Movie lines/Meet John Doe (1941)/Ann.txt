Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper�and forty heads are chopped off!
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Yes, I did, John. But I�I had no idea what was going on.
Look, John�what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a�
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
I guess so. Then what happened?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Ted Sheldon.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
About me?
No.
No, thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Uh-huh . . .
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going�
Hello, John.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
John Doe. The one in there.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
Yes!
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Against anything. Just protest.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Um-hum.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Are you all right?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter�and stick by it?
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
John! I'm so glad to see you. I�I was terribly worried.
Mr. D. B. Norton!
A third party?
Oh!
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well�I don't quite know what to say . . .
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Better let me talk to him.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much for everything.
How do you do.
A hundred dollars!
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Money.
Thirty dollars.
Yes, sir.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
You bet I will, Ma.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Huh?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
What?
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
The Websters!
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Thank you.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
What's the idea?
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Take it easy, John Doe.
I got it all ready. Here.
Oh!
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract?
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room�under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that�eating a sandwich�and with a beard!
Oh.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
That's our man. He's made to order.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Sorry.
Plus a bonus.
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Anybody! Er, er�Beany'll do!
Well, you're catching on.
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
John Doe.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius� Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe�and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
John Doe.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
There is no letter. I made it up.
There is no letter.
There is no letter.
Oh!
What letter?
What's that?
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
Oh, let me go, will you!
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Where's Connell?
Have you seen him?
Has he been here?
Colonel!
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Where'd you play?
Baseball?
What do you do when you work?
Had any schooling?
