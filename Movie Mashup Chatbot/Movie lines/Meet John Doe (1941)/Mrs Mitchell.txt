You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Uh-huh.
Good night, John.
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Did you want to see her about something important?
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
It's good to see you. Sit down.
