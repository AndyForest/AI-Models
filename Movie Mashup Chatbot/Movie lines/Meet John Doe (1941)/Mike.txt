Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make�and it's all written out for you.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
I know one way you can do it.
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove�flopped into a chair�and has taken out his ocarina.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Well, you know how they are in baseball�if a guy's mixed up in a racket�
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
That's too bad.
Nineteen!
