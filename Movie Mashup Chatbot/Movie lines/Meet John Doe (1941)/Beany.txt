Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Hey, Boss.
Both of 'em?
Yeah, Boss?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Look!
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh�
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there�
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
St-rike!
Ba-ll!
Sure. Mostly often.
Who are they?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Who?
Who's got him?
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Help yourself.
