Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
You didn't?
Did you write this?
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but�there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
Yeah, that's the one.
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
Can I help you pack?
Me?
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Hello.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Oh. Yeah.
Who?
Who?
No.
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied�
Oh, yuh did, huh?
You got me.
Against what?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think�
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
With all of it?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Action?
Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Huh?
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, maybe.
John Doe Club?
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Sure, you are.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd�
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Sure.
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Yeah. It certainly is.
Yeah, you bet!
You betcha.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
I trust him.
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started�
No, I didn't write it, but�
What difference does that make?
Yes! I was paid! But the�
That's got nothing to do with it!
That's a lie! Listen�don't believe what he says . . .
That's a lie!
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot�you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Well, I was thinking that�Yeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the�
Oh!
She isn't?
Flowers.
It's for Ann . . .
Thanks.
Okay.
Yeah.
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
How?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Racket? What do you mean?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a�
What do you mean, too bad?
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
