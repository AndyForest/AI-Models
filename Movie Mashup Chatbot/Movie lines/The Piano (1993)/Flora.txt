Yes, it's unholy.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
The Alps.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
My REAL father was a famous German composer
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
She says, throw the piano overboard.
He chopped it off
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
Everyone has to practice.
She wants to see what you can do.
Wash them again.
You have to wash them.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
Mama.
Do I know any gigs?
What will I play?
He's given it to us.
Tomorrow.
She never gives him a turn.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
What on?
Hello.
We can't leave the piano
She wants it to come.
It must come.
It's my mother's piano.
