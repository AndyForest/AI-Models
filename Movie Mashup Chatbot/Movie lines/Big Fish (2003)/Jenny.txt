Lucky girl.
I know.
Go.
Please. Go. Just go.
It's okay, just leave it.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
So I've heard.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
You must be Edward Bloom.
Promise me you'll come back.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
How old are you?
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
Was she nekkid?
What did she look like?
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
I wasn't expecting you.
Oh. Oh.
