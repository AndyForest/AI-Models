Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
A pleasure.
Will.
