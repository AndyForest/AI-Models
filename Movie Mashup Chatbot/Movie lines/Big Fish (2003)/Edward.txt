Thank you.
There's only one I want.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Someone stole my backpack.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Yes!
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
That's great.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I don't expect to.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
I have to leave. Tonight.
It truly is.
No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
What is this place?
You were expecting me?
Yes.
Edward Bloom.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Don.
I brought it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
Fine, I will.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
I'll...
Lord, I'm sorry I...
I can get it. I can just...
I see. I thank you for your time.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
Helping people makes me happy.
It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
In so many words, yes.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
How did you know?
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
Eighteen.
Yeah.
Well, she... uh...
Did you see that woman?
And I like you.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
There was one time when I was eleven...
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Well, it's not a short one.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Spooning the sherbet.
They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
I was dreaming.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
Beats me.
Okay.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
What's your name, Giant?
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
Yes. Exactly.
Story of my life.
The River!
Let's get out of here.
Like this.
How I go.
Tell me how it happens.
The river.
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
It would kill you, huh?
You think I'm fake.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
What?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Son?
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
I think someone hasn't.
Did I ever tell you about how...
Oh, so you know.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
You know where the chemicals are?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
You mean, while I'm here.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
True story.
You owe me three-fifty.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
She was a witch.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
You learned from the best.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Jesus Christ.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
I was drying out.
Go out with me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
They're your favorite flower.
Oh.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
'Fraid so.
So what are you up to now?
That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
I don't believe it!
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Really.
Wait! I need those!
