Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
This is it? The whole vault.
I'm robbing this place.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
There is no softer ground than town.
