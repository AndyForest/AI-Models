I like your stories.
You were talking about your wedding.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I never knew.
Please?
Can I take your picture?
Stop.
No, I understand.
That's terrible.
What were you dreaming about?
Hi. How are you feeling?
Really.
I do.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
I need to lie down for a bit.
I'll help you.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
Yes.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
You're not.
But it's not true.
Do you love him?
Do you love your father?
Mmm, what?
But it's romantic.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
You never told me how your parents met.
I talked with your father last night.
I'm going with you.
I'm going with you.
You need to go.
It's bad.
