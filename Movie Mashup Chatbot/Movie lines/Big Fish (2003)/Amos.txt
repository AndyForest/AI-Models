Good luck, kid.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
That would explain the indigestion.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
See! The big guy likes it.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
Great, great. That's fantastic.
