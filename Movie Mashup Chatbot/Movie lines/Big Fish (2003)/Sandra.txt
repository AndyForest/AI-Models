I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
How can I convince you to stop?
You don't even know me.
How did you get so many?
Daffodils?
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I'm sorry.
I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
I'm going to check on him.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
Yes. Thank you.
That's okay?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Yes?
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
Do you know who that is?
Was she one of your teachers?
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes.
Of course.
Really! That's wonderful.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
He's up with your father.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
How did you get here?
