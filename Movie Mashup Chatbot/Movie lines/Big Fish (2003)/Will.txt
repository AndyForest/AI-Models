No.
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
How would you describe him?
How long have you known my father?
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
Can I see him?
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
It's unbelievable.
You say...
Where are we headed?
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Okay. Okay.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
How what happens?
The river?
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Dad!
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Can we talk?
Dad?
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
Yes.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Why not religion, Dad?
I thought you weren't dying.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
I will.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
You're right.
When did you ever work in an office?
Really.
What did he say?
Okay.
So how does it happen?
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
Really.
You think I'm up for it?
Did you do any of that?
Am I?
I'm not scared.
The one about the witch.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Make him stop.
You didn't become crazy.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Because he's dying.
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
Were you and my father having an affair?
How did you know my father?
Are you Jenny Hill?
Hello.
Is he going to be okay?
What happened?
I need you on my side.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
Mmm.
That's because most of it never happened.
They met at Auburn.
Did you?
You don't have to.
Probably tonight.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
So you never bought any land.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Mom?
Is he awake?
That really happened?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Yes. But that's a different...
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How much time does he have left?
How is he?
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
We rented a car.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
