You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
Checking........
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
He probably has a history of this shit.
So ?
What's wrong ?
You did.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
When will that be ?
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
Got it.
But, he's...
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
Yes, sir Mom.
What ? Are you my mother ?
What ?
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
The power went out in half the park.
What the ... ?
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
I think I'll see hat action.
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
<<belch>>
I can see that but where ?
Was that the Old Man ?
You're paying the bills.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Look he figured it out !
Maybe you should get over fears.
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
I don't know.....
What ?????
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Aren't you the bitter one.
So who are these people with the Boss ?
I'm listening.
No I am not.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
Then what do you want ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I was.
What did you hear ?
He's been expecting you.
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
