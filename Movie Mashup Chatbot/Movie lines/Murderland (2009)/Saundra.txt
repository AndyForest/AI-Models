Bye....
Yeah a real shame.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
That was eleven years ago.
What are you DOING here ?
Just stop it. End it here.
What about you ?
What was that ?
Do you know where you're going ?
I don't get it.
Where are we going ?
Great...
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
This is cute.
Let's go.
You okay ?
Okay.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
I wanted to let his family know....
I... I .....
I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
And you believe that ?
What do you mean ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
He hired you to build this place ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
So why this ?
How long till the room fills ?
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
What's the trick here ?
I'm listening.
Not listening !
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
I'm not listening.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
What ?
I'm leaving.
McCay knows ?
First Bank ? But how ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
So what do we do ?
So where does this lead ?
Come on, it works.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
How do we get out of this room ?
Now where do we go ?
I'm not fucking him..
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
No !
What about Matt ?
Why should we trust you ?
Where are we ?
What's going on ?
Why don't you shut up now.
No.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
He was right behind me !
Come to the rescue again I see.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
What now ?
We made it !
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
I'm fine.
Zach from work ?
What ?
Shut up ! It's me.
How's your foot ?
We just having our first date when you showed up.
I'm talking to you asshole !
Which one, this door is locked !
Are you okay ?
I think we should follow him...
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
Yahoo !!!!!
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
Are you okay ?
What an incredible view !
Thanks.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Sure.
As appealing as that sounds...
Yes.
Yes.
Do you want to go out with me ?
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Excuse me, gentlemen
Thank you.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Good morning.
