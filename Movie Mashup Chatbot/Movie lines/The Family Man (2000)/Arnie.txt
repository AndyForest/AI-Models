You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You�re doing well...
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
I never won anything in bowling.
How�d you know my name?
I don�t care if you�re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can�t park here.
Hey, you can�t park that thing here.
So Jack, it�s your wife�s birthday, got anything to say to her?
All I�m saying it there isn�t a guy in Union County who wouldn�t give his left nut to be married to Kate...
C�mon, Evelyn Thompson�s got no class.  She doesn�t marry Dr. Steve, the woman�s living in a trailer.
Screw the rules.  I�m talking about the choice.
Look, maybe I�m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation�s harmless but you�re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You�re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
She said that?
She is relentless.
Hey Jack, you�re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
You�re right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
Where�s your follow through?  Where�s your stance?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god�s sake!
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn�t the life I dreamt about.  Where�s the romance, where�s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can�t have...
You see, it�s like we�re in each other�s heads...
It�s not Kate, is it?
Trouble at work?
What am I saying?  You don�t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that�s all.  Is that you?
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Maybe I don�t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It�s throwin� everybody off.  What do you think?
