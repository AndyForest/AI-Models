Fighting�s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
That�s right.  Okay, let�s make a quick stop at the kids� shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I�ll run into the linen store...
We�re almost done here...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
You�re jumping, sweetheart...
Don�t do this, Jack... But he continues...
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Jack.
Jesus, Jack...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Not with what they pay me...
That�s the one...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I�m going to be heading it up.
I�m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It�s a box marked �Jack.�  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Don�t worry about it, Jack...
It�s good to see you...
Jack...God, it�s been so long...You look...
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
I promise, Jack...
Are you okay, Jack?
You�ve been Jack Campbell.  And that�s always a good thing...
It�s been interesting, that�s for sure.
Don�t do that...
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Jack.
I can�t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn�t want to raise the kids here?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
Annie goes to a great school.
Are you out of your mind?
What are you talking about, Jack?
A perk for what?
For the week?
So what�s the big surprise? You didn�t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
It�s like a museum.
I could stay here forever...
That�s all I wanted to hear...
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Way out...
I don�t know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
What are you sure about?
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you�ve seen my pay check.
C�mon, Jack, you think there aren�t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I�m doing in New Jersey...
I think it�s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It�s very human.
And now...?
Worse, you mean...
Now I�m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we�ll deal with it.
Okay...
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
How do you even know about this place?
Jack...can we afford all this?
You actually forgot our anniversary.
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it�s light out.
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it�s a knock-off, but I think it�ll look great on you...
No, open it...
Jack.
Nice, Jack.  You�re sweeping me off my feet.
Then say it...just say it to me...!
C�mon, you know what I like to hear...
Say it, Jack...
It�s good, right?
You want the cake!?
Sorry, Jack.  It�s too important to me.
You mean this chocolate cake?
How was the game, honey?
If you want to look at it that way...
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would�ve happened if you hadn�t stepped in at the store.
The trek out to the hospital every day didn�t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You can�t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Good, Jack.  Maybe we�ll keep her.
I think it worked out okay, don�t you?
Well...Annie for one.
Maybe you�re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn�t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that�s what it�s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids� college fund.
It�s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Really.
Excuse me?
No?
Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  C�mon, take it off.  We�ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
Look at me like you haven�t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
How can you do that?
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Thanks, Jack...
It�s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you�re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don�t have time for wining and dining.
That is the general idea, yes...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
And...?
...my feet are hurtin�...
You�re having a bad day, I�ll go with you...actually, there�s no way in hell you�re gettin� me back out there...
Fine, she�s the kid�s dog.  Let�s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
She�s your dog, Jack.
Here you go...
Jack...
Uh huh...
Funny, Jack.  I�m laughing on the inside.
Because you�ll be here.
Telling my mother she doesn�t have to stay with the kids.
You look forward to this party all year.  What�s with you today?
Look, we don�t have time for this right now, we�ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You�re not wearing that to the Thompsons� party. I don�t care how hilarious you think it is...
Jack...don�t even start...
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Where were you?
What kind of man does that!?
Are you okay?
I can't seem to let go of you...
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
Go. I�m sorry, you should just go...
Right, for us. But...I�m afraid that if you get on that plane...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Don�t  go, Jack...
I know we�ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
I found it!
Yes!
You didn�t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
