Adelle?
Hello?
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
No...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Her assistant?
Kate Reynolds...
Ooh, my suits are ready...
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
No.
But I think I like you better this way...
What�s going on here?
Oh, I�m hearing you, Alan. That�s not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I don�t care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and don�t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
Good for you. Why shouldn�t you protect what�s yours.
Seven.  Really.
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You�re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
Take you, for instance...
And I know people.
It�s okay, Alan. I get it. I�m in your shoes, I�m thinking exactly the same thing...but here�s the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, it�s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they�re gonna send their kids to college.  It�s just people...
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Well, Alan, I think we�re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
That�s right. And auto supply...
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
I can see that, Alan.
Mr. Mintz.
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
Is that tonight?
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
What are you doing?
Ah. A classic...
Very nice. What is it?
Right.  That�s a major oversight...  So if I�m Kate...I can�t really afford the finer things, my husband�s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I�m trapped in suburbia...
Maybe there�s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
Don�t you think that�s a little gimmicky?
Like what?
Big Ed�s?  Big Ed�s Tires?  Why...?
Where do I go now?
Got it.  Good tip.
Five thirty.  Okay.
Check...
Sure.
I think I could figure it out.
On a case by case basis...
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Who did?
I don�t know...
This isn�t my real life. It�s just a glimpse...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could�ve been really good friends...
Yes, that�s it...yes, we went to high school together.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
We bowl together. We�re bowlers ...we won a championship...we�re winners.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
It�s me, Jack...
It�s your birthday? Today?  What�s your name?  Where were you born?
Hey, is that really necessary?
I�m telling you, those rules don�t apply to me, Arn.
It wouldn�t really be cheating...  It�s complicated.
So could you write down her exact address?
Pretty much.
She wants to have an affair with me.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
Hey, I�m doing the best I can...  I�d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
Damn...
It�s just two kids, right?
Kate�s my wife...
I don�t think so.
Is it...?
I�m having kind of a bad day.
We�re friends, aren�t we?
Great room...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we�re a mom and pop operation, we�re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
I�ve got all the time in the world...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it�ll be returned!
Where�s my car?!  Where�s my Ferrari!?
I�ve got kids, I�m going home...
You can�t do this. You can�t keep coming in and out of people�s lives, messing things up...
But what do I do?
What�s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
That�s it?  That�s all I get?!  A glare?!
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
Why not?
Look, I just want my life back.  Now what�s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let�s talk turkey!  How much money...?
How much time?!
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Please.  Just tell me what�s happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
Give me my goddamn life back!
You mean because you thought I was cocky I�m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Brought what on myself?! I didn�t do anything!
What the hell is happening to me?!
What?!
That�s my car!  You stole my car!
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
I've got everything I need.
Me?
Everyone needs something.
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Hey...
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
How'd you know my name was Jack?
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
No.
It would help me if we were.
Is there something going on between us?
Are we...?
You�re a nurse?
Something like that.
Evelyn, right?
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
I don�t think so, thank you...
It�s lovely...
Maybe you�re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Look, I don�t know what�s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Frank.  Where�s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Thanks.  To you too...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Why don�t you let me take this one, Kenny?
If you�re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
Well, I�m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
That�s the kind of thing you can really build on...
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Thank you.
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
What are you talking about?  It�s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
How�d you do this year, Tony?
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Please. Let�s just go have a cup of coffee. That�s all I�m asking for. I�m sure there�s another flight to Paris tonight.
Don�t get on that plane!
You can�t go!
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
You�re not married, are you?
So you�re not at a non- profit firm?
To Paris. Paris, France.
You�re moving...
Paris?
What�s going on?
I'm sorry...
You look great.
Kate...
Promise me again...
Please, just promise me you�ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don�t, then it�s like it never happened and I don�t think I could live with that.
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
But I�ve done some good things too, haven�t I?
Look, you�re making this into something it�s not. This isn�t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It�s a step forward...  Don�t you see?  I�m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
This is New York City, it�s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren�t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I�m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
I don�t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We�ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
You�re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
This place is a perk, Kate.
Think bigger.
Pretty incredible, isn�t it?
I don�t think I�d fight you on that one...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
You�re so...beautiful...
I�m out of the doghouse?
I�ll just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Good things...
It�s wonderful...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
That�s a big one for me, too.
But you always seem so certain.
Now...I don�t...
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
Are you sure?
I think it may help us but there�s a slight chance it could make things worse.
I need to tell you something.
But I�m gettin� close, right?
What�s the difference? I�m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
I�ll fix it.  I�ll go out right now and get you something.  I�ll make it right.
I know that, but...
Here�s the thing.  I really hadn�t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary�s good all day...
You really are incredible...
Zeena...
Maybe I should wait...
Wait a minute.  You�re my wife?
What? You make me hot...
Not it...?
Oh yeah, you�re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I�m gonna take you to that special place...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
What...?
Thank you...
I want it...
C�mon.
That�s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, where�s that chocolate cake...?
How would you look at it?
Our life in a nutshell...
That�s why I work for Big Ed?
You had a heart attack?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why�d we ever leave?
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn�t we?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Surprise.  We�re pregnant...  Yeah...that must�ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Look, I�m sorry.  I�m sorry I was such a saint before and I�m such a prick now.  Maybe I�m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
I can�t believe it�s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could�ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
What�s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I�m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I�m sick of it.
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
She got those shoes...
It�s an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  I�m gonna buy it...
Do what?
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there�s no question about that.  But this...  ...you�ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
No, I�m serious...you�re really stunning...
Whatever you say...honey.
Shouldn�t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Wait a second.  You want me, don�t you?
I�m working on a new deal now...
Hey!  I was watching that!
Well that�s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
Uh...that baby�s crying...
HEY!
Hello!
But it�s twenty degrees outside...
No, she�s not.
You�re kidding me...
Pro bono.  You don�t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
Yes, I�m fine.  It�s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Why not?
What are you doing?
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don�t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Party?  Oh no, I can�t go to a party...
Look, you don�t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Because that�s where I live.
I was in the city.
I don�t know!  Please stop yelling at me!
Yeah...fine.
You hear me complaining about that?
No, you�re right.  What are we doing?
What?
For us, Kate.
You mean don�t go at all? What about my internship?
About the plane? What do you think it�s gonna crash? Don�t say that...
All in one tape?
A shelter?!  I�m the richest guy in the building...I�ve got twice the square footage you have!
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I�ll be fine...
It�s because I�m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Mrs. Peterson.
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You�re a scotch man, single malt, not because it�s trendy but because you�ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
For one thing, you like expensive things.
You�re a little tougher, Peter.
But you�re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Not exactly. I�ve seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
Peter Lassiter...
Not by a long shot.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Where is he?
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
And God love you for it.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
I�m sorry, no...
No...I�m not...
Damn...damn...damn...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
You won�t regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A�s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
For the money, they�re hands down the best radial we carry...
Christmas?  It can�t be Christmas...
That�s totally see through...
If it's something you feel strongly about.
I've got plenty of places to go.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
So we'll get egg nog.
Tonight.
I want to see you again.
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
Of course I did.
