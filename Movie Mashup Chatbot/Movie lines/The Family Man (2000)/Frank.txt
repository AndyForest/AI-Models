I don�t care who you are.  It�s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Mr. Mintz?  I don�t think so...building�s closed pal.  You�ll have to come back tomorrow.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
