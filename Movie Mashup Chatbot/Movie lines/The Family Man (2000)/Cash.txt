You know what the word glimpse means, J? It�s by nature an impermanent thing.
C�mon, Jack...
Look Jack I�m late.  I�d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn�t work like that and I can�t tell you why.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of �em take a couple seconds...  ...some of �em take a lot longer...
It�s a glimpse, Jacko.
You?  What about me?  I�m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You�re making a business deal...
No?  C�mon, Jack...I�ve got everything I need, I don�t have regrets, that�s just not for me... sound familiar?
Look, I don�t know what you�re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Basically, it�s my car now.  Get in.
It�s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Miss me, Jack?
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
You just said everyone needs something.
Yeah?  What do you need?
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
A lucky streak, huh?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
I call all you white guys "Jack."
Damn, you are the real thing...
Yes you do...
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
What're you talkin' about?
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
