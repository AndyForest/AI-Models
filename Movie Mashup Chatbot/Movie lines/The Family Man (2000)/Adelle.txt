You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They�re all panicked here...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody�s here.
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
So you left her?  Just like that?
Excuse me?
You?  Married?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
