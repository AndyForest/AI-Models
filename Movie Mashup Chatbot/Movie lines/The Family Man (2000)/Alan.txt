So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu �Art of War� tricks?
Excuse me?
It�s not good.  Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. We�re not sure which one, Julia�s on it right now. Word is they�re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  The Global people are up in arms.  They say we should�ve been prepared for this.  We�re in trouble here, Jack...
Jack, are you okay?
I don�t think you�re hearing me.
...that�s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
What about me?
I�m sure you do...
I�m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Really. So you�re projecting what, a tad over two million?
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
A broker? Really. And now you�re in the tire business?
You have kids, Jack?
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Why Jack?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
I don't know.  Maybe...
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
