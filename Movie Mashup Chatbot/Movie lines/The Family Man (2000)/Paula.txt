Merry Christmas...
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
Don't you have anywhere to go?
I'm taking the train...
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I'd like that, too.
Thanks.  You're not bad yourself...
Last night was great...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
