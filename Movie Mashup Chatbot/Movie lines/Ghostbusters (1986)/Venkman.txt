I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Ready?  What is it?
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
Whoa!! Nice voice.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Is he dying or something?
Who's the stiff?
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
You're the best one in your row.
Great rehearsal.
No kiss?
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Don't scream.
I want to help you.
On a purely scientific basis.
I think I should spend the night here.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
Yeah, yeah.
Damn!
I know.  It happened by itself.
You're quite a housekeeper.
Well, let's check it out.
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
That's too bad.
Thanks.  What's in there?
No?  What do I act like?
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
It's in the stars.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
So what do you think it was?
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
I see.
But why?  The students love us!
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
We'll get back to you.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Why do you want to see it?
The magic word is "please."
Because you didn't say the magic word.
No, you may not.
Yes, it would.
In a storage facility.
I'm not at liberty to say.
You could say that.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
Great!  How's it going?
Can I help you?
Then my theory was correct.
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Nervous?
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Good guess -- but no.
All right.  What is it?
But it's my favorite state.
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
What now?
Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
Gozer.
She said he was "the Destructor."
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Where's the Keymaster?
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
What do you mean "bad?"
Why not?
What?
Yeah, I can smell it.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Wow!
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
What have you got, Egon?
Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
What?  What popped in there?
Agile bastard, isn't he?
Well, that ought to do it.
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Who was the architect?
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
How do you know?
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Ray -- Something's here.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
So do I.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
To go into business for ourselves.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
What do I say?
What do we do now?
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
Looked at with your eyes.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
