Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
I want you to have this.
That's so romantic.
In the physical sense.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Here are tonight's calls.
What calls?
