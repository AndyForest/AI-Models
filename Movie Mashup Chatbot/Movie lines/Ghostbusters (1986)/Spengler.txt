Thank you.
I don't believe in luck.
What is it?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
Die in what sense?
I think it's the food of the future.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Is that a game?
Print is dead.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Life is just a state of mind.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
You talked to Gozer?
Who?
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Oh, shit!
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
All right, Peter.  Good night.
All right.  I'll try.
I agree.
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Does she want to be?
What is it?
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
Don't cross the beams.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
Something was definitely here.
Did you see anything?
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
I'm always serious.
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Oh!  You're here.
That appears to be the case.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
I've got to sleep.
Neutronize.  System shut.
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
We'd better adjust our streams.
I blame myself.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
