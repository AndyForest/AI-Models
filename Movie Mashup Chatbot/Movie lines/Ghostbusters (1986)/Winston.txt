What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Right.  We'll believe anything.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Do you believe in God?
Me, too.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
