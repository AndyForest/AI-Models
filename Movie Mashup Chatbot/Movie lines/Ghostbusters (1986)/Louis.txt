I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
I got the Twister game for later ...
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
