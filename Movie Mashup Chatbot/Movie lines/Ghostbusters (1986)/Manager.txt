Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
