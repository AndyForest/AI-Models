That's "Peck!"
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
See!  They are using drugs.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
May I please see the storage facility?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
And may I see this storage facility?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
Are you Peter Venkman?
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
