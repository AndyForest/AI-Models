I wanted to see the white horse --
I thought this was a school day.
I can't.
I want it --
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
He was a nice horse.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
Well --
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
Are you a doctor, too?
