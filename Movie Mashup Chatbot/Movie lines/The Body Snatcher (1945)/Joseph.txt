I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
But where did they get those people?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
I come from Lisbon.
Burke them?
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
Can anyone hear what we say?
Yes.
I know --
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
