What about the "Roaring Twenties"ï¿½ or "The 80's"?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
You're Pam?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
I just can't look at you the same way.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
No, I'm alone.
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
Yeah, actually I do.
Our penguin, right?
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Boys.
You have to say that. You're my student.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
Yoooooow.
You remember that story?
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
This seat taken?
Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
So what are you thinking for college?
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
You like her?
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
