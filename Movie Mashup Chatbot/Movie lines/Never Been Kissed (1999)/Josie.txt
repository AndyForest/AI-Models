Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Oh. I forgot.
What?
Right. 7:30.
ï¿½ uhh, must have forgotten-
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
It is?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Yeah, I know.
What's that?
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
What is with this school and prom?
College?
Petty good.
Thanks.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Oh I know.
Yeah. Let's do that.
Why do they listen to Guy?
How long will they watch us for?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
What?
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Wow. It's packed.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
nan
Anita!
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
How about this?
Very romantic.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
That is lingerie.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
You don't think I can do it.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Anita!
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Forget it.
Yeah.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Roger in Op/Ed.
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Wings?
What is this?
George! What are you doing here?
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
Betty.
Do I want to be crunched?
Why?
Transitioned?
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
He's my teacher!
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
What if I say no?
Gus?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
They hid my car--
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
Uhh, no.
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Kristen got a quote?
Oh. Right.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Hey--I can be out of control.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
A--flack jacket.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
You've done five of my ideas.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Five-- Six--
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
You said that already.
Oh.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Hey. There.
Rob's?
Oh my god.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Hey Rob, what's going on?
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
I-
wasn't even thinking about-
Really?
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Thanks. And what are -
Rufus?
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
You're twenty-three years old!
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Better than I...
Yes, desperately.
Is that true?
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Rob. Please focus.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
I can't do this.
Good.
Are mom and dad here?
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Josie Grossie.
It was a long time ago -
What!?
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
It's just for a couple of months.
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
Better person than I.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
That is so--weird that you name your car.
I finally found my story.
Please. Please don't walk away.
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
But now you don't have to--
Wait, I was going to tell you--
You were attracted to me?
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
Yeah, I have.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
Well, are you here with anybody?
Thanks. So do you.
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Oh--yikes!
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Do you think you'll find her?
To put us back together again when we fall.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
When are you going to open your eyes?
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
Why do you do that?
I know.
I don't have to say that.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
Don't look down!
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Are you--scared?
Thank you.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
Thank you.
Oh I don't think so.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
Sure, why?
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
I love the way she writes.
Dorothy Parker--
Sorry. Forgetful.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Why?
What?
