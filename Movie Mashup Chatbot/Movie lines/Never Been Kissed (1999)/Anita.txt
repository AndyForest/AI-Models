Nope.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
YOU KNIT?
Oh, man! Who told?
Well excuse me.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Right. Right.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
If you say so.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
You need my help?
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Hi!
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Cuuuute!
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
Bridgework?
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
Now this is cute.
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
Okay. That's bad.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Senorita Josie.
Jos, that's not what we're --
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexyï¿½  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
You stood for like a month.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
Who told!
Guess who I did it with last night...
