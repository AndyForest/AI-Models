No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
I know.
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Wow, Josie- you look really-
And a gymnast!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
No. Josie, this is real.
That's the spirit!
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Little known fact.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Why is that impossible?
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
No, I mean, no big whoop.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Don't you remember what they called you?
Do you remember high school?
Wow. This must be big.
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
See!
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
Wow - I-
Maybe we should sit.
Yeah. Definitely.
Well, a ball player.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
