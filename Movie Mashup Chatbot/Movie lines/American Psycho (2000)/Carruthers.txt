Patrick?
Where are you going?
Call me please, Patrick.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Patrick? Is that you?
It looks so soft.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
