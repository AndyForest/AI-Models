This is nicer than your other apartment.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Alright.
I don't think so.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
You just haven't been looking.
