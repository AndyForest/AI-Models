That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
What is that?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
Where are you going?
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
No more... I can't!
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
I just want you to like me.
I have to.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
It was nothing.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
Stop the car!  Now!!
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Maybe.
I don't see anything.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Gulp!
Are they following us?
Please... be cool.
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
Is... is everything all right?
Not us!  He's really creepy.
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Faster!  Eat faster!
What are we gonna do?
Stick around and you'll see.
My whole world.
I'm sorry.
Hi.
