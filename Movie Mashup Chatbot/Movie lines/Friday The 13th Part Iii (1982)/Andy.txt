You're all just jealous.
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
Who brought up this bright idea?
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
Same thing.
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
Do you want a beer or not?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
You're too clean for me.
What're you doin'?
I vote for me.
I'll think of something.
I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
How do we do it?
If you insist.
How about a roll in the hay?
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
I don't know...
Where's Shelly?
Breakfast?
I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
What're you gonna do?
