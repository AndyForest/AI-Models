Be a man, man.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
It's Friday the 13th.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
This is all the exercise I need...
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
I'm a slow eater.
Chuck... look.
Yes, man!
