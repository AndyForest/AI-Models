Will you come with me?
Don't do that to me!
What's the matter?!
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
It's dark down there.
I love you, man!
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
