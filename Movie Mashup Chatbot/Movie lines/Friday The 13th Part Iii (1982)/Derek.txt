You know him?
Sure, just watch where you're going.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
What happened that night?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
And, what about us?
Why did you come back here?
What do you mean?
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
This is too painful to look at.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
What?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Is that so bad?
Hello.  How are you?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Why?
