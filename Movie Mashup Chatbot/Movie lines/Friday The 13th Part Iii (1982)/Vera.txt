You're wrong.
I never said you were "nothing".
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
You don't "have to."
Why do you do these stupid things?!
Damn you, Shelly!
Don't say any more.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Bullseye!
You're the boss.
What're you doing?
This is no time to celebrate!
Got any good ideas?
Keep looking.
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
See anything?
Yes.
May be please have the wallet.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Why don't you help us?
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
In that little thing?
What d'ya got in there?
You're Shelly?
