Sure.
What?
Barely.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
I vote for the hammock.
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Think you can figure it out?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
Not now.  I'm cold.
What're you doing?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Why don't we go take a swim?
What was that?
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
Cool it, Andy.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
A hammock?
What's this?
Come on down!
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
Which one is it?
