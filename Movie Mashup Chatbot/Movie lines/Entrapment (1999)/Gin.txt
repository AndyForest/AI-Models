I'm going to get him, I promise you.
Too late now.
He's on to something bigger.
I'm in the middle.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
I don't know, but close.
We're getting close.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
We've got to catch him in the act.
Yeah. Me.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Mac's signature.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Bingo.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Through a window.
I don't recall asking your permission.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
You gave them the eight billion.
He looks familiar.
--You're a cop.
My god--
What about you?
But--
What's wrong.
I'm not leaving without you.
No, you can't.
Hang on.
No way.
Jesus.
The door's the only way out!
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
FUCKING THING!!!
Jesus God, it's going through.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
The sign of our partnership.
I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Not for me.
That's because you grew up rich.
Four billion dollars.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
But would you--would you--
It was wrong to deceive you.
You have something in mind?
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Surgically attached.
Parachute.
Pulse detectors.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
How do I look?
Feeling old?
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
We're doing it tonight.
That's where the Mask comes in.
Got it.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Peoples China Bank.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
The eight billion. From them to us.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
My job, my rules.
Oh my god, I thought--
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
The Mask. Where is it?
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Everything.
I always knew you'd do the job.
Hold the record. Alone.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Okay, 80-20--
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
You don't know the half of it.
Your share.
A billion dollars.
The big job.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Yes. Yes.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
What?
We did it.
Shut up.
Duh.
They moved it.
Got it.
Ready.
You can't be too careful.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
One, two, three...
It's a party.
In eye of that painting.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
And--
Something like that.
He wasn't.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Terrified. Still am.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
To us. To the Mask.
Aren't we early?
I've got something for you.
Won't take any time.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Thank you.
You bought this for me?
It's---beautiful.
That's it. We're ready.
Charged. Receiver?
Got it.
A dozen times.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
I didn't mean to get personal.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Hmmm.
Did I hear a car?
Let's do it again.
Why don't we take oxygen?
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Let's just see how we do.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
No. It's a down payment.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
I'll need that.
Someone was expecting that.
It was perfect.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
That's because I wanted them to!
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
We go underwater?
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
In a week.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Nice spot.
And good morning.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
What's my problem? You want a list?
I don't believe this.
That's entrapment.
Where's my bag?
You stole my luggage? You--
Those are my clothes.
What about your bags?
We're going to die, aren't we...
It's one way.
Motorcycle.
You what--?
What the hell was that?
What the hell do I do now?
Not funny.
He says they turned the card down.
A film case.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
But--
It's a fake.
How much am I paying?
Fine. What do I do?
It's a test.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
You want me to pick up a painting?
Not a word.
Maybe I should drive this time.
We going somewhere?
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
You can't.
But Roki said--
I know.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
Well, no...but...
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
I've got something for you.
No. Why would I be?
You...you can't.
So alive.
I didn't expect you to be so...
You're not taking me seriously.
I've got something...
Excuse me?
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
That's good. Terrific.
Are you...okay?
You disappeared.
I'll call an ambulance.
Uh, yes.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
I have a proposal for you.
I don't want to waste your time.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Mr. MacDougal.
How about if I try humility.
It's sold.
No you can't.
Uh. I'm showing off.
Who am I?
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
