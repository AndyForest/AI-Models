You mean the seven billion.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
Put this on!
I cannot get rid of you.
Get out of here!
Go!
Come on.
You can do it.
I sincerely hope not.
The disc is still in there.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
Relax, don't jam it...
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
They drive so recklessly there.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
I'm sorry.
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Have really held you under?
But that's all behind us now.
That was a lifetime ago.
Call it a new tradition.
There is one more thing.
You shouldn't have.
No way to take another day or two?
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
Packed.
Charged.
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
Can't be too careful.
Like a woman of mystery.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
There's always a surprise.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
You can't be serious.
So how long till we do this?
You've thought of everything.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
It's no good without the argon gas.
A parting gift from the Empire.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
And the money goes--
Where the money is.
What's that?
Right. The eight billion.
Transfer.
Well...What are we doing?
What about the rules?
I'd taken the Mask?
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
You've got everything planned.
Hmmm...44 long.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
We're living history here.
Get the hell in.
What?
There is no big job.
It's your mistake.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
Okay, you're a thief.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
The Mask.
Careful...careful.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Behind you.
Can you see the other PIRs?
Ready?
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
You're not on the beat.
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
We're working.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Camera in the--
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Aren't we all.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
You were afraid of heights?
You're nervous again.
To our...partnership.
Little celebration before we set off.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
Thank you.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
I trust it's your size.
One more item--not on the check list.
Charged?
The lipstick thermal camera?
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
So how long to pop the floor?
Yes you did.
It was a long time ago.
Our equipment has arrived.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
We are...for the tools.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
On what? Another job?
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
True enough.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
I go in alone.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
Only a week?
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
I know it well.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
Good morning.
You're late.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
And--
Lose something?
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I never carry...baggage.
I'm not the one to ask...
We're only going one way.
Got it.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
Look on the back. What do you see?
Can you follow simple directions?
Give him the card.
I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
That's my girl.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Very nice.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Possibly.
Oh?
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
It's not for sale.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
The Empress Death Mask.
For God's sake.
Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Not interested.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
Do you mind?
So what?
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
I sincerely hope so.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
Seems I am.
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
You have a car?
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
Then don't.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
How about if you try disappearing.
I can't?
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
Why are we speaking Chinese?
That is of no interest.
I have a question...
Probably not.
Yes it does.
My friend, you always surprise me.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
Call it an expression of trust.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
You'll just have to have faith.
You know where my loyalties lie.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
She's calling the shots now.
This is just show and tell.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
Check out my ball.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
Suspicious, after all these years?
We're supposed to.
Because it pays off.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
It's too soon.
You look like George Washington.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
Oh, it is.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
Black of course.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
Right.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
It's never big enough.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
You are a miracle worker.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
The key to success is using the right tools.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
And you do it so well.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Which is--
Next time I'll use valet parking.
