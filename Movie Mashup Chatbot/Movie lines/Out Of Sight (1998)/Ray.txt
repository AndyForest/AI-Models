We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.

I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.

I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
