Karen, I told you not to--
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
Who was the friend?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Ironic, isn't it?
