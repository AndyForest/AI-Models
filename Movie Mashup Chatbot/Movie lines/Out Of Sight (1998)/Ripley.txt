If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Five point two.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
Have they got Midge up there?
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Foley?  That you?
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
What's to think about?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
It's a big house.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
I know what you're talking about.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Really?
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
Thanks for your help.
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Foley's got it.
Midge.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Still...
Well, I need that...
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
What?
Thank you...
