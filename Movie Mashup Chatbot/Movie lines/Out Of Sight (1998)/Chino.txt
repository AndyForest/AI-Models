Tell me, how do you do that?
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
What?!
I want to speak with you, please.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
Oh, is this Adele?
Excuse me, Adele?
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
I could walk out of here.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Wait.  You not Adele?
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
Why you think is today?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
