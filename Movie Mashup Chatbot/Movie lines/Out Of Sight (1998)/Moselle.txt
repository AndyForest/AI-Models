I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Was a she, name Tuffy.
Got run over by a car.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Here?  In this house?
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
You a lawyer?
You not with probation, one of those?
You like to sit down?
That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
What do you want?
