Thank you.
Ask him his name.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Till they got busted.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Really.  Hm.
Did you know that when you married him?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
He called the day he escaped.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Why not?
You didn't visit him in prison.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
No, thanks.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
Call and tell you.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
The manager's door is metal.
You're gonna use a ram?
They're in 7D.
That's all I wanted to know.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Sure, Daniel.
All right, but...
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Daniel.  Listen --
Shut up.
You'll have to ask him.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Is that what you would've done?
And what happened to Carl?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
It was an unusual experience.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
In the trunk, yeah?
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Hello, Daniel.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
You don't, huh?
You can live or die, it's up to you.
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
What do you want to bet?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Leave it where it is.
Wait, I know him --okay?
Oh-kay...
Hello?
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
I'll need a last known address.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
No, I didn't know that.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Who?
Quite a mess.
How are you, Raymond?
You know what I mean.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
You think I'd shoot you?
Come on, Jack -- don't.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You're not dumb.
I don't know.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
So she did help you?
You were going to see her?
Where?
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
You waved to me in the elevator.
What were you gonna do with me?
You believe that?
He killed a police officer.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
You really wear that suit.
You like taking risks.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
Oh, God...
Or once.
Well, does it make sense to you?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It smelled.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
I don't have a problem with it.
What, as a sales rep?
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
Love it.
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
Don't leave me.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Unless you wanna tell me.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Why not?
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Think I could have them back?
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
That's my dad.
None of your business.
How'd you get this number?
Yes.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
I mean, romantically.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
You have to be kidding.
You'd probably tell me.
Nothing.
Bleeding on a country road.
Peter Finch.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Faye Dunaway.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Of course I am.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
That's funny.
How many was that?
Why, are you famous?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
In my bag, in the car.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
If I could have a little more room.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Gee, I wonder why not.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Why's that?
And is Foley a part of this?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
What's going on, Glenn?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
You're not?
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Glenn, take the exit.
Take the next exit.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
Do we have a gun in the car?
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
You don't remember me, do you?
Glenn?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Oh...
How's it going?
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
Hi, Ray.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
Just a minute.
You're not my type.
Flyweight.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
I can tell.
You're a fighter?
The State Theater?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
What did you call it?
Your dog was killed?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
He said he stayed here last November.
No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
No.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Thanks.
That's not Maurice?
I'm looking for Maurice.
Moselle Miller?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
It's possible.  Why?
None I'd like to share.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
I didn't have time.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
Not at all.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
Hello?
Was it Foley?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
No, he looks a lot...
He doesn't even look like that.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
Huh.
What'd I say?
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
I really gotta go.
Dad...
No thanks.
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
Can we change the subject?
He's about to.
Technically.  They're separated.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Thanks, Dad.
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
It's beautiful.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
