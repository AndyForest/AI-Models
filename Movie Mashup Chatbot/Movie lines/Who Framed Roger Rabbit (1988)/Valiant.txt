Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
So where is it then?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Shoulda guessed.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
I'll bet.
Oh, no...
What's that comin' from the bar?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Maroon, right?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
He's a Toon... who cares?
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Check the scrawl.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
You?
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
What the hell's a freeway?
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
So you're Cloverleaf?
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
They must've taken it off me.
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
Ask her...
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
No...
What am I, Earl?
Toon cops worked me over.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Hold on a second.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
A joker to the end.
So where is it?
How did you get onto Doom?
He's right here in the...
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Why didn't you tell me?
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
You shot Roger.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
So altruistic.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Doom.
What's with the dip?
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
What a gasser.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
That's what you woke me up for?
Take it easy.
No, I don't.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
That was the idea.
Stop what?
Maybe.  Why?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
As soon as is humanly possible.
Aren't you the lucky one...
So's the job.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
I don't work in Toontown.
So what do you want me to do?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Only time will tell.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
Keep reading...
I think you oughta read it to her.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Yeah...
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
I rest my case.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Forget it.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
No, it's not.
Get away from there.
Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Me.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
My brother.  Get inside.
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Yeah, that's better.
Don't ever forget that.
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
What the hell are you doin'?
Aah!
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
