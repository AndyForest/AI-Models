So what's your next move, Valiant?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
You serve martinis, doncha?
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
