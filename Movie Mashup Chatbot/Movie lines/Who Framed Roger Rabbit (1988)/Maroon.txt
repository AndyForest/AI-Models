There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
You tricked me, damn you!
You got the will in there, don't ya?
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Valiant!  You surprised me.
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Have you got the will?
I've already seen your photographs.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Sure, Valiant, sure...
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
When will I hear from you?
I got him on loan from Disney.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
