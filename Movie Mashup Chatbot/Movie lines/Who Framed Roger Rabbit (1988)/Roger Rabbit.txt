Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
A tweeting bird?
From this box here...
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
Good idea.
Yeah?
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Yeah?
Two bits.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
Wrong number?
I'll get it.
Safe?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
How do you know that?
The habeus corpus is thickening.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
Does this help?
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Aah!
Divorce?  Never!
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
