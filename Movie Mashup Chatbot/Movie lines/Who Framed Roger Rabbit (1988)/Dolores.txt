Well, I'll be...
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Yeah...
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Sounds like singin'.
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
What was <u>that</u>?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
So you decided to help him after all?
It's all yours.
He's a riot.
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Bastards put him on notice.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
R.K. Maroon.
Is this paper even good?
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
