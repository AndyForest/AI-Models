I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
No...no...we can't...we can't..
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Leave me alone...I wanna go...
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
