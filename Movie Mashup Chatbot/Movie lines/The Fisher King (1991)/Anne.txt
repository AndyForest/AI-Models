Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Yeah!
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
What?
Fine.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
...SO...anybody special in your life?
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Yeah.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Most men are.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
... What?... You don't want to commute?
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
<u>Whoah</u>!  Oh, honey, that's terrific!
You're kidding!  What did he say?
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
What are you two up to?
Thank you very much.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Hello....congratulations.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
What does that mean?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
And who's Lydia?
The moron?
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
Can I have my desk please.
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Okay.  ... I love you...
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
... So... where did you sleep last night?
You're all right... you sure...
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
<u>What</u>!
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
