Yep! Right on it!
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Why this is outrageous!...
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Got any more bread crust?
It was a crime.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
Beautiful night huh?
I know!
I'm still scared.
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
What are the other reasons?
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
Holdin' my penis...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Happily married, probably.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
Are there any questions?
Bingo!
Who are you talking to Jack?
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
It's a classic.
Who?
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
The Red Knight!
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
So what? You going to help me?
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
You really want to help me?
Well what am I gonna do with it?
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
Can I take you to lunch?
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
Fifty dollars?
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
I don't know.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
Funny -- you look married.
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
I know...
Parry.
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
But I can't get it... He's...
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
They work for Him.
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
... Do you know who I am?
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!
They said you're The One.
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
Sshhhh!
<u>What</u>!?
They're --  -- What?
My name is Parry.
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Great place huh?
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
You won't be alone for long.
Are you all right?
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
You're out numbered son.
I advise you to let us go.
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...
No, I...
No.
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
Excuse me...
I don't drink coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
What are we about to do?
I never say anything I have to.
Well, it's enough for me.
Don't say that.
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
It sounds exciting.
Yeah.
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
No just Parry.
