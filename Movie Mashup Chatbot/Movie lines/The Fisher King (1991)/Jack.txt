I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
How have you been?
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
No.
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
No... it's just...
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
What?
No, it's not... Come here...
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
Thanks.
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
My agent.  I called my agent.
You were great. Thanks alot.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
What do you think?
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
He just needs some clothes?
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
See, I told you!
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
I... You're not going to understand this.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
He's not a moron.
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
You still believe in God?
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
No, I'm fine... really...
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
I was attacked.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
What if I was a relative?
But..How could that happen?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
Parry?
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Tragedy?
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Uh... basement I think...
Remember. One chorus and out.
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
Yes... I... I agree...
I... I was just leaving.
I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE "AND" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT...
How un-sixties of you.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
Tonight!  How's tonight?
Well, since you're a member, we could...
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline...
Yes.  They're free.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Well there....  What's the difference?
A list.
Your name was picked.
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Hello Lydia?
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
In a bar called Hellfire.
Will you stand still so I can do this!
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
Sure...
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
What?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
.....What are you doing?
Yes. I think that's very fair.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
It's such a great song.
Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Parry...
The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
SAW WHO!!?
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
You're totally gone, aren't you?
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
Will you shut-up!!!
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
But I gave it to you!
What are you doing?  Give that back!
No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
That's O.K.
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
Why did you do that?
What's her name?
Do you follow her every day?
Parry!
I'm not married.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not <u>any</u> One...
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Him...?
The Little...
A quest?
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
I'm the one what?
The Little People?
<u>What</u>?!
Where -- ?
Hi... Where are my shoes?
No... thanks... Listen --
Where am I?
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
Have I died?
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
I need a drink.
Please don't hurt me?
