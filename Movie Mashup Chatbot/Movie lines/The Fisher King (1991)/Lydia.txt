No really..I can't.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
Really?
I'm paying you.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts...
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Meeting ... people.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Well, there's nobody special!
Do I look like I have someone special?
My parents were divorced.
You threw him out?
Will it hurt?
No, thank you.
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Well did you or didn't you?
But now it's free, right?
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
How much?
Free?
Now what?
So how do we do this?
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Which ones?
Huh-huh.
Yes.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Shhh...
You have a disease.
Divorced.
You're married.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
You don't have to say that.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
There isn't any more to tell.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
How do you know him?
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
What a gyp.
Got any Ethel Merman?
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
I don't like horror movies!
Oh...like Moses.
Parry Parry?
