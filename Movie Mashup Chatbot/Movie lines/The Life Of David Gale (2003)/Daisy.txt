Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
But I'm having a good time...
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
