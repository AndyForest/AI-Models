But you can't.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Take care of me?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Married?
Why not?
She's alright, isn't she?
Yeah.
Sure, boss.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Yes, sir.
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Yes, boss.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Here!
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
I got it... boss.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
Engagement ring!
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
I know it begins with a "C"...
That's because I've never been here before.
I know you're not talking to me...
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Yeah? You and what army?
They're touching.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
You didn't get ketchup?
I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
I can't eat this.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
'Course I was right. About what?
Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
What'd you say?
I can't do it.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Go where, Ray?
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Don't touch that car.
Goodnight, Ray.
I'm not working on a plan.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
What?!
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
That's the way it is.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Let me see that.
Crawfords.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Him?
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
What am I gonna eat?
I can't eat it with mustard.
You get ketchup?
I know people.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
The hell you talking about? What train?
Say what?
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
Don't mention it.
Come on, Ray, time to go!
That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
You drew this?!
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Let me take a look at that map.
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
What'd you say?
Does that mean I'm in?
No.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
You still got that map?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What's up, Ray?
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
Forget it.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
So?
No, man. I want you to have it.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
This fork is filthy.
So?
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
What ain't there?
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
You lost all our money in a card game?
What are you talking about?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Reward?
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
Alright. You want some pie?
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
What'd you say?
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Oooh...
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
You need collateral.
Uh-huh.
That's right, a loan officer.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
No, tell me what's so funny.
What?
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
What are they gonna do to us?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Where they taking us, anyway?
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Good old Monroe.
You went to Monroe?
Claude Banks.
I don't think so.
I try to moisturize regularly.
'Preciate it. Claude.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
I'm all right.
