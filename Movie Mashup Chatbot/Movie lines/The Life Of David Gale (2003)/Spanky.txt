If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Where'd you get this?
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
