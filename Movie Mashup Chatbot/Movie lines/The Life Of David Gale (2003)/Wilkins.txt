I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Goodnight, Claude.
I'll be right back.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
What's going on here?
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Lemonade?
