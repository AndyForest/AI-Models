At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
