I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Rayford!
