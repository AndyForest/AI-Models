Yoo hoo, bomb...
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Doolittle, are you there?
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Oh, God...
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
The key!
Key?
Key? Key? What is the key?
I think he's talking to it.
Look, bomb...
Eventual supernova.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
I hope it's not the oven again.
Oh. What's wrong now?
What flickering light?
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
Right, that checks out here.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Arm yourself, bomb.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Hey, bomb...
Snap out of it, bomb.
Bomb?
Hey, bomb.
Hello, bomb.
Huh?
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Do you remember the detonation time?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Oh, sure.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
-- automatic channels open --
-- open circuit breakers --
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Veil nebula.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Wha?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Commander Powell would have named it.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
What are you gonna name it?
Naah. All stable.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Doolittle...
Yes, Doolittle.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Mafhkin oble groop...
