And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
off the peg?
Interesting suit.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
