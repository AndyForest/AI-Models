I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Here, let me do that.
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
shhh...
Everything's gonna be fine.
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Sort of half.....
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Hi,
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
Ali?  What's wrong?
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
One.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
Jesus.
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Tom Jones?
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
I said I'd check with you.
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Uh ... yes ...
Goodnight Annie.
Thanks, Annie.
Right first time.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Annie, it's me.
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
What happened?!!!
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
What?  What?
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
Isn't it?
Yes, isn't he.
She's ... well, she's good.
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
It's very good Bernie.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Say that again, son.
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.
Maybe two cars.
And a car.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Certainly is.
Quite right, sir.
Ahm....
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
No!
You're not going to ....
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Sure.  You're right.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Sean Connery.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
What makes you say that?
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
You arrange those flowers yourself?
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
How the hell should I know?
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Well, there is that ...
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
Great, good.
