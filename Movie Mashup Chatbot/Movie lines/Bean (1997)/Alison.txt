He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
No, I'm fine.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
About Charles...
Let's get a coffee.
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
0 my god.
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
Meaning?
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Hi.....  Roses.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
David, I'm serious!
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Your face smells like a foot.
Liar.
There were three strawberries.
Go ahead.
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
It isn't working any more, David.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
Did you really ask?
Scottish.
It's the last thing we need.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Do we know anything about him?
And what did you say?
There aren't hotels?
Yeeees?
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
