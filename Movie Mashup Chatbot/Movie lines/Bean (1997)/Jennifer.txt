Bye, Dad.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Welsh again.
Welsh.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
Come on Sting!
Of course he is.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
You.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Shut up, Kevin.
