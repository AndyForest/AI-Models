He's just parking the Governor's car.
Everything okay, David?
You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. .  Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.

But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
Great news.
