You never were...
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
Wild ride, huh?
Three seconds... two... one...
Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
Naw, you pull it!
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Why should I?
I say when it's over!
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
But you're not alone.
Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
Okay!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You gonna pull?
I'll take that as a yes.
Utah, you copy bruddah?
My man!
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
Ever done this before?
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
Come with Tyler.  She knows.
De nada.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
And that's why you never went pro?
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
