Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
So what'd the other guy look like?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Those are cold.
You don't have to.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Look at you.
You had enough?
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Catch of the day.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
This gonna take long?
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
What do you want?
