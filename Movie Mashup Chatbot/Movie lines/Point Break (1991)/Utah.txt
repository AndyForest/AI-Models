I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
I'm not FBI anymore.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
SHIT!!
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
You gotta tell me where she is.
Where's Roach?
Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
I'm not armed.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
I can't do this.
We're wasting time.
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
Talk.
You're a fucking dead man--
What's this?
You first!
You do it... you first!
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
We gonna jump or jerk off?
You gotta earn trust.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
Once.
One shot stopping.
How you figure?
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
A flaw I'm working on.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
I gotta be fucking crazy.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
Don't you gamble?
Where?
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
Thanks for stepping in.
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
What's their program?
Friends of yours, huh?
Not yet.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Caught my first tube this morning.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Babes.
A little mushy.
Fine.
Not so far.
Zero distortion, sir.
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
I take the skin off chicken.
Sir?
Yes, sir.
NOOO!!
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I know where they're going.
Nothing.
You sure?!
The hell are they?!
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
... so I started tailing him.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Aw shit.
Got it.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Right here, partner.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Okay, Dad.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Got it...
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Sorry.
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
They don't go for the vault?
Good move.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
The shit they pull, huh?
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Tyler, put the gun down.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
You're kneeling on my hand.
Ouch.
No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
I... I gotta go.
Warm them up.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
What?
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
What's goin' on?
What are you talking about?
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Meaning you were expendable.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Who's the girl?
Nice place.
Sure.
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
I'm serious.
I need you to teach me.
Shrimp and fries.
Bye.
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
My name's Johnny Utah!
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
Well, I saw you and--
