Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
What?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Surf conditions okay?
How was the beach?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
What that?
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
That's the point, isn't it?
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
