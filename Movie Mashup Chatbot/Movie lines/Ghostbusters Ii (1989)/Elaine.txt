It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
