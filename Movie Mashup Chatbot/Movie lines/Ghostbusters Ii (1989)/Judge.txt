You've got to stop them.  Please!
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
You've got to do something!
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Get on with it, counselor!
Yes.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
