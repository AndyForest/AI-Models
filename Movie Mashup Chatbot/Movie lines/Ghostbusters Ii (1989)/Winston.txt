There's something very familiar about this painting.
Rivers of the stuff!
Is the line sinking?
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Are you all right?
No, I just thought --
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
You finished here?
Now that's one ugly dude.
You got a flux and a half.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Does it have any favorites?
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
I'm ready.
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Wonder what?
And decent.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
Tell him about the toaster.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
