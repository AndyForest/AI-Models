So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
I command you.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
