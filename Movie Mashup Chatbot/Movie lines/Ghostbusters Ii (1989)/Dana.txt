I'd rather not.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
We don't have a relationship.
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
Everybody has a choice.
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
What do you want with my baby?
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
Good night, Janosz.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Janosz?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Thank you.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Does he ever mention me?
How is he these days?
Do you ever see him?
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
What are you working on, Egon?
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
That's exactly what you said last week.
No, you didn't, Frank.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
You're also a human being, Frank.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
That's a terrible thing to say.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
Maybe I should call Janine.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
Does she know anything about babies?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
I don't know what to do anymore.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Good-bye, Peter.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Good luck.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
That's where the buggy stopped.
We definitely had a moment or two.
I'll do it.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
His name is Oscar.
What do you think?
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
Hello, Peter.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Hi, Egon.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
