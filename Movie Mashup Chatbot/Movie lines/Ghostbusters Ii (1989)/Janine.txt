You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Well, good night, Louis.
That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
What are you doing up here?
Who are you going to call?
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
