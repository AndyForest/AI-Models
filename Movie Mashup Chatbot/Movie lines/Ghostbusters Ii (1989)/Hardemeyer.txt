Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
That's quite a story.
Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
Can I help you?
