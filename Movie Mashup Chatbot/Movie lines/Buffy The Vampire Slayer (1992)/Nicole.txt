I haven't seen him tonight.
Hi.
Later for it.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
You're having a fling with him?
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
I guess.
Cassandra's really smart.
I don't get it.
Thank you very much.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
Come one, that was so weird.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
Good enough!
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
They don't even have Dolby.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Cool!
Buffy!
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Nee sitch.  No way.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
And the January Semi-formal --
Except for Prom.
So, we're stupid now?
Like you've got a grip.
What are you talking about?
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
I really was way way too too.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Nice much.
Well, look who's here.
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Right!
Environment.  That's cool with me.
The homelesses?
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
Oh, God.
