I know.  I like your little outfit.
Yeah, whoops I came.
Get out of my facial.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
Cafe Blase.
Let's meet tonight, okay?
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Nice ensemble!
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
Beverly Center.
Well, where?
What are we doing?
Please.  It's so '91.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
Buffy?
Okay.
Throw it out.
Well, I hope so.
I can't believe they still ate it.
They'll kill us!
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Wit-tay.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
Right.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
Oh, thank you very much.
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Smell of booze much.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Oh, yeah!
Okay.
Oh, please.
Like we don't have rights too?
He is so bald.
