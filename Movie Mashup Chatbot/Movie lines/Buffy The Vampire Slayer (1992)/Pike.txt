I mean it.
Get away from here.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
You look like shit, Benny.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
You think?  Split?
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
Would you sleep with them?
You didn't like them.
Bummer metaphor.
We hate you guys!
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
It's coffee.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
No, we didn't.
Wrong answer!  No prize.
Booo!
You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
Are you okay?
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
That's me.
I crashed your party.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
I should have known.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
What for?
Second word... sound like 'dance'.
Come again?
Dress, huh?  What for?
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
Who?
Buffy?  What's wrong?
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
I know.
You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
Hey, Buffy...
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
No, you're not.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
I'll back that up.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Water.  Okay.
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Hi there.
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Will you guys shut up, please?
You want some punch?
Hey, wait a minute...
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Run.
I am.
I don't think so.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
