Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Don't grab me, okay?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Andy!
Nice game.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Hi, guys.
Dying.
Don't tread on the earth?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Yeah, I guess.
What's playing there?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Maybe.
Yeah?
Uum... around ten?
You left me a message?
You broke up with my machine?
No, you didn't.  When?
I don't understand.
I thought we were meeting here.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
'Bye.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
I do?  I guess I do.
Jealous?
Hi.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Nothing.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Mmmnkay.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
What show is this?
Something like that.
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
I am so sure.
No...
I think you've forgotten something.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Get away from me!
Good thing one of us was prepared.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
I'm going out the front.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
I'm glad you came.
Pretty shallow of you.
Leave me alone.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
He did what he was supposed to.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
I'm going to the dance.
I'm going to the senior dance.
For the dance.
A dress.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Merrick...
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Thanks.
Why'd you come back?
I didn't expect to see you.
Yeah?
Mmkay.
You sure?
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
Things are kind of confusing.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
Where are you gonna go?
Well, stay here tonight.
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Yeah.
Not exactly.
You want some water or something?
How are you doing?
Is that your car?
Hi.
Buffy.
You guys are thrashed.
It could happen.
Like my homework.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Bugs.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
I forgot.
Get a boob job.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
Where?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Why don't we see a movie?
) What do you think?
He knows who I am!
And where are they now?
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
I'm curious, is all.
I wish you would.
Watchers?
How can you keep doing this?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Five?
I...
Oh, fuck you!
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
You are such a wet.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Fine.
What!?!
Oh.
They were vampires?
My nails.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Put your head back.
Oh.  Sorry.
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
But you threw a knife at my head!
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
No -- you don't have to --
Who we gonna beat?
Okay.
Here?
Sporting events, yeah.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Uh... gym.
Not a pressing issue.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
What?
Oh, him.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Why do you keep saying that?
What, um...  What do we do?
Our purposes.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
I have cheerleading squad.
All right.
She --
All right.  What do we do now?
Wait a minute.
None of your business.  God.
Ow.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
How do you know all this?
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
I was a slave.
Everybody does.
Just stay away from me, okay?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Time to do what?
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
Why?
What are you talking about?
Am I in trouble or something?
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Oh.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Hi, guys.
Nicole...
Pike.
Sorry.
Thanks.
B'bye.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
That is so cool.
I was just scared is all.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
That's the plan.
No THX.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
