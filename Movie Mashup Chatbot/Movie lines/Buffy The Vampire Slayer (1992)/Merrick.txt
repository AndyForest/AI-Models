Which way did she go?
Wheels?
Yes.
Did you see a girl come by here?
Wait!
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Football is my life.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
All right.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
There isn't time.
Interesting.
I want to die.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
I can't work this.
Vampires of the world, beware.
As for example, what?
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
It isn't important.
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Not if you're careful.
Five.
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Buffy...
Don't start with me again.
A what?
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Try to pay attention.
Same one.
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Your turn.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
I don't think you understand the full implications of --
It was necessary.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
I had to test you.
Oh.  Good.
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
Who we gonna beat?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
We'll cover it later.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
It's true.
Skip it.
Meet me at this address after school.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Where's the other one?
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
This is it.
Cramps?
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
I have to show you.
Lothos.
China.
In Virginia.
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
Yes.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Wait!
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
To bring you... your birthright.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
I'm looking for you, actually.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
