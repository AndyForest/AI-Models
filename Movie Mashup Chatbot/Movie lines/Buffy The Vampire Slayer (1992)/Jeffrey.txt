Yes!
Nice to feel needed.
What's with you?
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Well, um... litter?
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
You weren't home.  Like always.
Didn't you get my message?
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
I'm here with Jenny.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
So I noticed.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Hey there.
Come on, what was it?
What'd you dream about?
You were having a nightmare.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
It's the news, Buffy.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
You okay?
I heard she got straight A's.
Okay, let's go.
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
Buffy?
Oh, baby!
Write that down.
