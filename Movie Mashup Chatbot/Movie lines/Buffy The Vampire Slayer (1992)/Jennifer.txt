Hi, Buffy.
Eeyuu.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Excellent.
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.

No --
Jeffrey!
Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Okay, what else?
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
And Spring Fling.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Does Jeffrey know?
What is she...
I never thought of that.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
You're kidding.
What happened?
Omniplex?
