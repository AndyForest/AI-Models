No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
Cheer up.  You may still.
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Shut up!  You let him have it!
What's wrong with you!?!
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
I am a God!  A God!
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
You're even weaker than the others.
What?
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
Really?
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
So very much.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
