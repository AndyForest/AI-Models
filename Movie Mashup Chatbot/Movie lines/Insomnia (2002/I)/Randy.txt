Thought I smelled something.
She didn't tell me.
I don't know.
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
How should I know?...
I told you I don't remember.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Stuff.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Huh?
Huh?
