I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...

Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
You know I remember that.

I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
Eight years.
