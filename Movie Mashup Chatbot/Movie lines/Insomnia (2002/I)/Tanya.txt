Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
She used some stupid code name.
My arm!
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
It was like some big fucking secret!
She wouldn't tell me!
I don't know.
No...
That's what I said.
Hey...
Long as it's fun.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Since grade school.
I was her best friend.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
