She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
That's right.
That boyfriend.  Randy.
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
That's right.
Wild card.
You're not following procedure.
Where's your back-up?
If you want it to be...
Yes.  Like that.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Then so was mine...
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
But we work so well together...
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
Told you I could write an ending.
He.  Well, he...
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Yes.
Yes.
I was a mentor to her.
No.
I suppose.
She was only seventeen.
Down at the station?
Thought you might find that.
Oh?
I'm sorry?
No game.
