This is stupid.
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
What good will that do?
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
What happened?
What happened? Were you kicked out?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
You what?!  How did you do that?
Where'd you find them?
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Charlie...
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
To put the rout all that was not life.  And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.  Pledge Overstreet.
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
Who's in?
Sure.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Hey, he's your roommate.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
Yeah.
Isn't there an easier way?
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
Where are you going?
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Then you can help him.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
Yes sir.
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Father, I--
Father!
You know me, always taking on too much.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
But father, it's not fair.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
The god of the cave.
Look at this.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
But different.
I don't know.
Visit from my father.
That's it!  "Follow my voice.  We'll try no manhood here."  See you at dinner.
Put more into it!
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Oh..
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
Todd, what's the matter?
Quiet.  I have to think.
From my father and Nolan.
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
No.
Er  No.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
A play, dummy.
What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
I've found it.
God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
What?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
What is it then?
Want to come to the study group?
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
What?
So what do you think of my father?
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
