Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
I don't think they're in school.
Knox?
Well, no shit, Sherlock
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Don't come.
What do you mean you don't know?
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
What is the point?
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Well?
At Chet Danburry's house.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Hey, this is great.
Women swoon!
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
How was dinner?
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Charlie Dalton.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
This is it.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Except sex.
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
And English, and trig
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
So much the better.
I couldn't stop myself.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
It should, but I found it and now I claim it.  carpe cavern, guys.  Seize the cave.
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Oh come on, Pitts...
I'm sorry.  I, we
Yes sir.
Yeah?  Like what?
But I thought-
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Mr. Keating!
I here and now commit myself to daring!
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
But...
I'm not?
What?
I think you're sweet.
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
I told you, that's a secret.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Yes... sir.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Doing fine, sir.
It's better than doing nothing.
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
No.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
It's Nuwanda.
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
All right.  I'll second that.
I'm in.
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
That's not my fault.
What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
