I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
I'm sorry, Neil.
