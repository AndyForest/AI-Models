But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Oh God, it's over now!
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
Well...
All right!  What'd she say?
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
You have another choice.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
Too bad.
What is it?
What is this, a midnight study group?
That's miles.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Weird.
