This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
Don't stop.
Nuwanda?  Please?
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
You know what really excites me about you?
I think he's sweet.
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
Isn't he precious?
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
