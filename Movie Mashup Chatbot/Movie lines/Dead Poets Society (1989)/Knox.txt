Will do.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Actually I don't
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
I'll tell you later.
Yep.
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
So?
Yeah.
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
No, I've been calm all my life!  If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
But why?
It will?  How do you figure?
I don't know.  I don't get it.
What is the Dead Poets Society?
Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
Knox Overstreet.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
My Word
Dead Poets honor.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Then come with me.
Are you going with Chet?
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
But I love you.
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
You can't be in here.
Chris!
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Chris!
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
But, Chris...
No.
I'll be there.  The Danburrys.  Friday night.  Thank you, Chris.
Well, sure!
You are?  She's glad I called!
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Sort of.
So, uh, where are you in school?
The pleasure is mine.
Yes sir.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
I don't know.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
You really think I should forget her?
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
I'm calling her!
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
