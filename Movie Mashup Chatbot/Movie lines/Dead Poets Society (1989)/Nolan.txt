If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  Stand up.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
Who else was involved in this?
what?!
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
