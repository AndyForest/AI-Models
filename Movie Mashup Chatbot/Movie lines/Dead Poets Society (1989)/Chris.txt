Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Knox?!
Chet...
Don't stop.
You know,
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
It's all right, Chet.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
What is that?
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Uh-huh.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Just like that?!  You just knew?
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Knox, I don't believe this!
Knox, you're crazy.
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Knox!  what are you doing here?
Huh?
I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Hello?
You going out for the Henley Hall play?  They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
That's your sister school, right?
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Pleased to meet you.
