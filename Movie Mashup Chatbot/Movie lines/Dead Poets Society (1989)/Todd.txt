I have something.
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
A crazy madman.
A madman.
AHHHHHH!
YAWP!
Yawp!
A yawp?
Do you have to quit the play?
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Yea, art thou there?
I'll come to the performance.
No thanks.
This play?
I will be with thee straight.
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
what?
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
Oh.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
It's my birthday.
Neil, you're not gonna...
From you?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
What is that supposed to mean?

Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
Come on, that's impossible.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
And now he will?
So?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
Found what?
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
I don't want to read.
Yes.  But
I... I just don't want to come.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
Nothing.
I'll take him over mine.
I don't.
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
My brother went here.
Todd Anderson.
