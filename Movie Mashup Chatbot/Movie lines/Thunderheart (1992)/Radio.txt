Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Ray. What's your 20?
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Ray. X22.
Come back?
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Go ahead, Ray.
X21, give me a 20.
