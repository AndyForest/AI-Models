Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
You're my hero, Carl.
Hey. Nice tie.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
Mr. Clear Moon.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
I see.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
Let the press through.
No way, Cooch.
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Why?
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Yes.
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
Thanks, Cooch.
Alright. Alright...
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
When did we get that?
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
I gave it back to her.
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Alright. Alright.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
Who is he?
Cooch. You're my hero.
Go ahead.
How'd you know?
Couldn't sleep.
I already did.
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Beats the hell outta me.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
-- a fucking cop.
I did.
This is a restricted area.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
Six rounds. 357.
You crashed my file?
Were you in Nam?
Jesus...
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
You take care.
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
Some Indian time?
What about the water...
We're in there. We're in there --
We're going for The Stronghold.
He's gone.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
This Clear Moon's house?
Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
1868...
Jesus. Oil?
What's that?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
Sorry.
What do you mean?
Well, it was just a dream, I --
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Crow Horse, listen --
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
What are you talking about?
Cuz you're a cop.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Take care of yourself, Walter.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
It's not real.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
That's not solid.
I don't see the connection.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
She's your sister?
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
So what?
And...
Because he was talking to me.
What was he saying?
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
What did he say?
What's he smoke in that?
He knows me?
What did he say?
Why does he wanna see me?
Medicine. As in medicine man?
Let's go.
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
His spiritual mother...
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
You've got no jurisdiction.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Bullshit.
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
What?!
What are you --
After we've completed our investigation.
Great.
What?
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
I desecrated it?
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
Move it, Magdelana.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Who did?
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
This Jimmy's?
That's right. Turn around.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
I'm on my way back in. Over.
X21. Come back.
Good.
I read, Cooch.
Never mind.
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
X22. Read.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
No. No, no. Thank you.
Mister Tully.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
How the hell do you know?
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
Get up!
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Leavenworth a tough joint?
At Sioux Falls Pen?
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
