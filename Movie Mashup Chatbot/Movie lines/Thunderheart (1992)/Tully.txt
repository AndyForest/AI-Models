The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
-- your father was part Sioux.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Do you want a coffee?
Ray...
