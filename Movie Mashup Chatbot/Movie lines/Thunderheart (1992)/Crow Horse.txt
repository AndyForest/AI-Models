His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Tell him, Ray.
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
It ain't Geronimo.
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
You didn't have another vision...
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
Ray.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
So they took care of Leo.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
What?
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
Stop.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Nothin'. Forget it.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Where was this?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
Still after Jimmy?
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
Not no more.
Cuz I'm a skin?
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Likewise.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
What you call myths, we call our history.
What'd you expect to hear?
Ray --
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
A what?
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
He also said "listen to the water."
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
He saw an owl.
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
Why should I tell you.
He said he doesn't know.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
You're steppin' on sign.
Watch out!
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
