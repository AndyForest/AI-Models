Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
Did he say that?
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
I know.
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
If she was dangerous before--
What are you going to do?
I'm a terrible friend.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
I was down in Adamant...
Okay.  Okay.
But Claire--
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Something was there.  You saw it.
Then what was it?
What?
Does Norman know?
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Are you okay?
I have to go.
Mef?  What's Mef?
M-E...
Shhh.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
This.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Sit down here.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
I don't...
What?
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Telling you...
Seance.
Know what I think?
You think he killed her?
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Yep.
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
Well good.  So you're human.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
You are?
How you holding up?
