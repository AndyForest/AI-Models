Then we both are.
What?
Did you?
I started seeing things.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
I miss you.
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
He loves you very much.  He just--
That's not true.
No, he wouldn't.
Why?
That was very good.
Of course you will.
I know that.
Yes?
Do you have a scarf?
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
No.
She said, "You know."  That I know.
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Yes, but...
What's happening to me?
How?
Are you humoring me?
You think that'll help?
What?
What do you think I should do?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
These are good.
You're joking.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
No.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Because he was worried about me.
I didn't want to come.
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Who's that?
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
At the party.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Uh-huh.  What can be?
I'm sorry?
Almost.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
I am.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
Oh-kay...
When...when will she be back?
Well maybe your wife...
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Um...
No.  No, I don't.
Um...sure.
What?
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Thank you.
Would you like some iced tea?
And then you weren't there.
You do?
Wait!  Don't go...
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
That's not...It's not like that.
Tell me.  I can help you.
Tell me.  Please.
What?  What are you afraid of?
Who?  Your husband?
Hello?
Is everything alright?
Um...yes.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
What was her major?
Of course.
I should be going anyway.
You must have been very proud.
I don't know.
She never mentioned her father.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
It's fine.
Claire.
No, I don't.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
Mrs. Frank?
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
She's making this up.
Do we have to?
Stop.
Oh God...
We were suite mates.
He was so pissed.
I didn't sleep with him.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
We know each other.
Wow.
I don't know...
I guess not.
Jody he was lying.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
What is it?
Like what?
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
I can't believe this is happening.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
I don't know.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
No.
All of us.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
Relieved?
Why?
Adamant?
Oh God...you knew.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Please.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Hartford?
Did I?
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Jody, she's alive.
It's alright.
I think so
Jody, wait.
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
Oh...
Nothing's happening.
I don't know.
The planchette?
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Wow.  I'm losing it.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Someone's there.
Please.  That's all I need.
...no...no...no...
Jody, no...
What?
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
You got it.
Absolutely.
It's niiice.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Jody--
What is it?
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Good.  I'm good.
MADISON!
Mauduh...
Mmmuh...
I don't believe you.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
You don't have to do that.
Nothing.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
Do you know it?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Adamant.
Look for antiques...
The leaves...
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
She can't be here without me.
She's gone.
It's alright.
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
She did it.
How did she know where it was?
Get out of my way.
You should have tried harder.
I'm not going to listen to this.
Stop...
Leave her out of this!
Who?
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
So you fucked a student?!
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
I was there.
"You know..."
Your wife...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Since when?
What's the matter?
Wouldn't go that far.
It's Madison Fra--
...I'm positive this time...
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
Yes.  The ghost.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Not personally.
What's wrong with me?
But I don't remember.
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
In the living room...
I...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
You told me that I was...
I felt you...looking through me...
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
Yep.
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Then where is she?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
I will NOT.
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
The accident...?
Sabotage?
What are you...?  No.
What?
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
We had a seance.
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
Norman...
I don't need a shrink.
Well, that's a relief.
We're going to be fine.
You're not at the center.
Five minutes?
What are you doing?
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
...Don't get all...
Tonight?
Oh.
When?
Dressed?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
I didn't do that.
See?
Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
Where is she then?
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
A flare?
No.  Look!  In the window.
No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
He killed her.
Shhhh.
Get down!  He'll see.
Huh.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
What?  No.  No.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
I'm so sorry.
That's...
Oh, no...
Well, that's nice.
Wow.
You're kidding.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You are so brilliant.
Really?
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
In the house.  I was scared.
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
No, no.  It's fine.
Oh.
Hi.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Hurry...
Norman, you have to look at this!
Promise?
I just wish you could have heard her.
I know.
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
But what if something happens?
That's not what I'm sug--
To make sure she's all right.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
More or less.
Of him I think.
After that.
Tomorrow.
Mmm.
Shhh.
Yup.
Nope.
I know.
We did.
To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
Not the focus.
I am, really.
Fine.
If you have to work...
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Three o'clock.
Yep.
It's Saturday.
Don't.
Norman Spencer.
She's awake.
What's their name?
I think three...
