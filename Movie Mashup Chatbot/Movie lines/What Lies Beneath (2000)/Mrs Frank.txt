Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
They're calling me in to work.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
Why are you here?
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
You look a little old for a student.
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
She never mentioned you.
What's your name?
Please leave me alone.
You know where she is?
Yeah.
