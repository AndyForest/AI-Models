What?
Shhhh.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
I know.
I'm cooking you dinner.
What's that for?
Don't think so.
Huh.
What?
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Claire...
How can you be sure?
What?
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
We have to get out of here.
We don't know that for sure.
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
Claire...
I tried to break it off!
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
To Caitlin!!
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
I never asked you to quit!
Claire, please don't...
That's not what I'm sayi--
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
Oh God...
Claire--
What?
STOP IT!
Who?
I don't like this, this...
It's too rough.
Ow!
I take it your not mad at me.
STOP IT!
...Please stop...
Stop...
The...
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
I may have seen her on campus.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
You dropped a glass.
You don't remember?
We walked all night...
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
You know I am.
What?
Call ya later.
Do I have everything?
Really big bed.
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
I'm sorry...
Claire, please...
Keep your voice down.
Sweetheart--
But then you've been so much better...
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
How did you--
Who did?
How do you know this?
This is the Feur thing?
What are you doing out here?
Are you lonely?
I never said...
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
Harvey says he's amazing.
There we go.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
...like it never even happened...
When you do this, I swear...
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
What am I looking at?
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
It's a ghost.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
It's a flare.
Our house.
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
What?
What's going on, Claire?
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Sorry.  You understand.
You didn't?
Did you tell her?
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
"...for my father."
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
You know what that does to me.
Yep.
I think so.  Maybe.
Think I may have cracked it.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
What kind of whispering?
Of course.
Did you call the police?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
What are you doing here?
Claire?
Unless you need me to come home...
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Is it gone?
Mmnph.
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
It's what I've been working for.
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Claire...
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
Why?
Remember how we were?
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Did she say that?
Of what?
I'll be there.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Maybe we should just...
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Did you...
Wanna fool around?
Tired?
It's just us now.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
You are...
You know what I mean.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
It's okay if you're not.
How are you?
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
Nice.  Almost done.
How is it?
Whatcha reading?
Claire?
It's today?
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
When's she out of here?
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
Three weeks.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
