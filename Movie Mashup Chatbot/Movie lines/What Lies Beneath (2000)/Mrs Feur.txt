I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
You must think I'm pathetic.
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Love.
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
No.
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
Your house is so beautiful.
Very much.
Right.  I'm sorry.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
I wanted to apologize.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
This fence...it's so...
I've never even met you.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
I can't, no, no, I can't...
And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
I'm not...
I've seen you.  From the window.
You're the flower lady.
Who are you?
