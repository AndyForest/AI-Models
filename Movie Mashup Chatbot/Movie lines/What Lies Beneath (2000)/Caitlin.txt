Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
No.  But once I heard...
A ghost?
What do you mean?
So much.
Are you mad at me?
I know he does.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
I'll come back all the time.
It's only two hours away.
Hey.
