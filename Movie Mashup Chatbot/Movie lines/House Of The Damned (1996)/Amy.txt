The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
It might have been her mother.
Colleen.
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
Damn it.
You say you saw some activity here?
Good-bye.
There's no need to be.
It will heal.
A few years older, perhaps.
Did you find her?!
It looks delicious...
Yes.  It was.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
Town records are coming up now.
They don't build them like this anymore.
What do these ingredients mean?
I don't understand.
By killing them?
Where does this amulet come from?
That poor little girl.
