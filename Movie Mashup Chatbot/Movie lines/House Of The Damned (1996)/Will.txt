Good-bye.
I'm sorry.
How's your arm?
Are you all right?
No!
Why don't you pass me your plate?
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
What will they tell you?
Suppose not.
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
Good night Angel...
Well, that all depends.
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Don't be afraid!
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
That's great, honey.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
For good luck honey.
He's blessing the house.
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
I'm all right...
Are you all right?
Maura!
No...  NO!
Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
Maura, what is this!
What are you talking about?
What?
Know what?
No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Ok...
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
Aubrey!
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
I think everything's ready.
A friend?
What are you talking about?
Whoa there...
It just disappeared.  Literally.
I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
Oh come on!
Who?
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
So what are you saying?
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
No.
The heater's here.
...set up some more things.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
I don't know.  That's strange.
What?
God rest her soul.
Or what she was worth.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
To our family.
Whatever you say.
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
What will Aubrey think?
Oh come on...
What's the matter?
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
The place is pretty dusty.
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
We'll be there.
Yes, they are.
What's going to happen?
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
The rain is letting up.
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
How long will it take!
What are you getting at!
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
What...amulet?
This isn't happening...
We'll never know for sure.
Good night.
Thank you.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
What was she afraid of?
How can I help you?
And you...are?
Well what is it!
What?
Not at all, if it can help.
Runic?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
And what would you do?
Oh.
