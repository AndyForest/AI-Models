We don't have proof of that.
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
What was her name?
Did you find something?
What's the matter?
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
My God, I heard something!
Take me to her.
Where is she now?
Where is she?
White meat will be fine...
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Maura.
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
There's something through that wall!
There's something in there.
Do you mind if I borrow it?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Where did you find this?
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
