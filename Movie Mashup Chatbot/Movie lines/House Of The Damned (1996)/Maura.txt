Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Go to your room!  Now!
We'll get it later.
We're going to go someplace new.
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
My angel!
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Can you talk to her?
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
No it won't - no it won't!
Who...is Colleen?
Well then who did?!
Don't play games with me, little girl.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Well I bet you they're happy.
Sure.
You're bleeding.
I'm ok.
What's happening!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
We're not going.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Do you think I'm a fool?
You don't think I know?
Should I...
I'm fine.
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
Aubrey!
She's gone!
Oh my God where is she!
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
How are we doing?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Are you ok?
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
What about keeping an open mind?
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Well what do you think it is?
But do you agree with me?
I don't know what I'm saying.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
What is it?
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
Were you fooling with the power?
Ok.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
What the hell is that?
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
Are you playing tricks on me?
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
I wish I knew more about her.
To our family.
It's just going to take a while.
You didn't think much about that before.
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
I just, I don't know...
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Must be...
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You'll have to settle for turkey.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Maura.
Before.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
What about the other five percent?
What do you mean, unfortunately?
I think we should do it.
We don't know.
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
Come back to us honey!
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
So what should we do, father?
Why?
What!
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
It was a shame.
Did you know her very well?
Oh, that's nice...
Yes, I am.
