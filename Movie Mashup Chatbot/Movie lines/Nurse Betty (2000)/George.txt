Thanks...
George...
I have... did it sound that bad?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
Yes... maybe it was.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
Didn't I?
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
I don't think your friend likes me.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
What happened when you were twelve?
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Yes, she is.
You're late, Eric.
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
You never gave us a chance...
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Oh, you mean Fred.
That's very kind of you.
I beg your pardon?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
Good.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
No! Let me try this!
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
...yeah.
Hmm?
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Can I have an evil twin?
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
