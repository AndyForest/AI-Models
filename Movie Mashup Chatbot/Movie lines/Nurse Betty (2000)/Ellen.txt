You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
Worse.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
What's his real name?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
Really?
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Sure I loved it! It was great.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Where you headed, Betty?
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
What's the matter here?
