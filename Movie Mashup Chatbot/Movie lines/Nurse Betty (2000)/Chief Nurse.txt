Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
