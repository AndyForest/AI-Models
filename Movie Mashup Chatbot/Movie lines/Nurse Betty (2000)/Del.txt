You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
That is a skill!
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
They're new to us...
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
...well, then you ain't got much.
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
What?
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
What's so special about it?
I ran back in to get the phone.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
My socks?
I... I don't know...
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
No...
I don't follow...
Of what?
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
Fine. You got five...
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Ahh... my wife's.
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Jesus Christ!
You better believe it.
It is, if you like idiots...
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
