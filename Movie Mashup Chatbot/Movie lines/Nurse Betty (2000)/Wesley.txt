What's wrong with you?
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
A doctor on the show... why?
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
I'm not telling.
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
I said, 'No.' N-O.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
No.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Worse... you're in Texas.
I know that.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
Half.
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
Like... us?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
...among others.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
Should I kill him now?
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
We can live with that.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
...that's a good motto.
I wanted to make a statement.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
I didn't. You gave me a look!
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
He told us it's in the Buick.
You told me how to do it!
IT SURE IS!!
A mark, huh?
Hell of a way to die.
Now, that's really stupid.
That is so right.
That's right.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
Relax, we brought the cash.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Beer, please.
"Injuns?"
He's waiting...
Really?
Seems like a nice place.
Isn't that the point?
What'd you get her?
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
Oh fuck...
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Yeah? The sport utility?
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Would you say she was ambitious?
You lie, motherfucker...
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Did Chloe crack?
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Huh?
Yeah?
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Her show?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
