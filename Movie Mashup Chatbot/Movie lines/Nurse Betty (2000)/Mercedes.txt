Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
