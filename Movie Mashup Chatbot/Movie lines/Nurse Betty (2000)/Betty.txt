Sheriff, I don't...
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
...I meant your food.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
They're fine... you miss it?
Oh. How come?
No, I was just... How you doing?
"Banners?"
I don't think I am.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
...what're you saying?
I'd rather not...
This is really awkward...
I better go check on them.
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
I'm sorry.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
"Thirty-two?"
Umm, I don't think that...
I am?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
...I... I know what you are.
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Umm... yes. Back home.
Yes, ma'am.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
I gotta go.
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
What are you talking about?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
All the time...
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Are you and Larry happy?
I gotta go make dinner.
Yeah, me too.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Maroon.  I stole it.
What?
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
It's all right.
No... what about your sister?
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Did you watch it yet?
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
David, please --
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Why are you doing this to me?
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Ad lib?
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I know. It's up to us.
Of course.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
You told me that two hours ago.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Lyla's very nice.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Why do they keep calling you George?
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
You knew Del?!
No, Del.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
We were engaged.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
I don't know.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I came for love...
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
I got you, Del...
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
...like the water purifiers?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
Sure you don't want any salad?
What was that?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
So, call me when you --
It's not really a good time, guys...
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Roy! What are you doing here?
It was Chloe...
Yes.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
What're you doing here, Roy?
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Make sure it's elevated...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
You made out alright.
Like Rome?
I'll go to the Hospital.
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
Dr. David Ravell.
How did you know?
No. Loma Vista.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
I left my husband two days ago.
That's horrible!
Did you love it?
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Los Angeles, California.
I'd slap his face.
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
I begged him to let me put that on!
...did I win some contest?
I married a car salesman.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
I have to leave now.
...this is your sweater, right?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
Rosa, so you've met David?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
You should have a little faith in people.
Rosa...
Are you sure I can borrow this?
No, almost never.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
He is real.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Looking for someone?
Umm...
What are those for?
...okay.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Fine.
HE IS REAL!!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
What? Where was he?!
Who?
You said in L.A., anything goes.
How many men have I talked to?
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
The Five?
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
The one you were telling me about?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
It's something I had to do. For David.
I came for love. My fianc� is here.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
He has no heartbeat!
