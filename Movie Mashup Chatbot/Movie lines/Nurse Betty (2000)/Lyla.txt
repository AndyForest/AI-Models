She called you 'George,' George.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
I SAID FORGET IT!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Is there a problem, George?
What the hell's going on?
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
I said I'll think about it.
I'll think about it.
I don't know, George...
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
We know that...
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
