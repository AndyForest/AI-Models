I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
I know plenty.
Little place called "Williams," why?
What about it?
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
Tell him what you told me.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
We think we know where Betty is.
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
You're lying!
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
Oww, the arm, the arm!
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
Anyway, so what?
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Yeah?
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Bad idea...
Did you send anyone out there?
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Jesus...
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
No, Elden, I need to...
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Oww! My arm, careful!
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
You should get the order you want.
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
You're in serious danger!
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Uh-huh.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
I swear to God!
She's a lesbian.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
