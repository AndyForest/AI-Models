No... Friends from the diner maybe?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
So she did witness it?
Could I have that in American?
How is she?
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Any idea where it is?
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
That's a nice name for what you need...
No, I didn't have to.
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
I know that...
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
A woman can write a check.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Junior year!
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You think a woman did that?!
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
It wasn't a woman.
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
...plenty
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
