Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
Do what?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Well, you are.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
What?
The LeSabre!
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Oh, Betty --
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Mr. Campbell?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
"A Reason to Love."
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
