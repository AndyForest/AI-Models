That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Indeed, he has often told me.
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
Did you wish to see someone?
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
You here again?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Well, news of Buckley?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
You found Buckley?
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
What are you going to do?
He isn't here.
