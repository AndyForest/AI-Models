How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
What do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.

You mean he doesn't work for you?
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
