[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Did she talk?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Who are you? What is your name?
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
But where do the rats come in?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Thousands?
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
Come on, we're wasting time.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
Take me down there.
What's that?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
I'd like to have a look.
What's down there?
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
How do you do.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
