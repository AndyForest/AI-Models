He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
Save it for Bourne.
What do you mean?
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
You told me Bourne was dead.
Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
Had to be done.
Why not? It was just money.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Sit down.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
No... It must have been Bourne.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
What?
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Berlin!
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Do you know what his budget was?
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
And what are we looking for?
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
Never heard of it.
Show me again...
Who else knows about this?
Lots of people...
Keep going...
Jesus...
It was staged?
And?
What do you have, Danny?
She say what time I should call?
Thanks.
