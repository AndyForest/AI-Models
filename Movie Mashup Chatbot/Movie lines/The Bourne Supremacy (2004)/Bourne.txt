I'm sorry.
I have to go now.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
I can't let you do that either.
Look at me.
You know I'm not.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
I don't want you to forgive me.
They loved you.  And I killed them.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
I killed them.
That's not what happened to your parents.
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
-- what? --
-- car keys?
How long? How long do I have --
You called it in?
I did.
What's going on in Berlin?
Pamela Landy?
Who sent you to Greece?
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
Try again.
Conklin.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
You still should've moved.
Front. Use your teeth.
Drop it.
I emptied it.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
I only dream about people who are dead.
I know it's a dream.
It might have.
I did.
I wanted to kill him.
Tell me later.
There's no choice.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- not yet --
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
Switch! You drive!
You drive.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
We can't wait to be sure.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
He was at the campground yesterday.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
The Telegraph office.
But it ends up the same.
I should be better by now.
It's just a nightmare.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
No. There's nothing new.
Conklin up front.
I was here!
That's a lie!
My first job.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
So when was I here?
Abbott?
Why are you here, then?
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
I killed him???
Last week? When?
A Russian?
Say it.
I want to hear it from you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
Why is she trying to kill me?
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
Who is Pamela Landy?
Get on it.
See that tram coming around the corner?
You didn't answer my question.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
What's that?
Why am I alive?
Oh, shit...
Where am I?
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
I want someone I know to take me in.
I want to come in.
It's me.
