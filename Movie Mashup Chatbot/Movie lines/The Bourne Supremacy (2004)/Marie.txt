Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
You do?
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
But you found another choice.
I love you, too.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
There must be another way!
What if it's not who you think it is?
Where are you going?
-- hang on --
-- it's just him? --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- where? -
What?
-- where's left to go? --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
Where --
That's crazy.
So...
But you're sure?
But we were so careful.
No... How?
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
Sleep. Sleep now.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
I worry when you get like this.
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
-- it hasn't been two years --
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
I'll get the book.
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
