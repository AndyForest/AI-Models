What if the world ends tomorrow?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Some things you should say anyway.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Peter, you're bleeding.
See?  You big dullard.
Use a fork.
Absolutely no class.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
It'll shut itself off.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Oh, Peter. A zit.
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
That's the understatement of the year.
