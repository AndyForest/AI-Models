Are you quite finished?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
