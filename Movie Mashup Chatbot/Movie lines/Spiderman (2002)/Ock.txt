Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.

No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
