Or was it all a dream?
I was there.
Flash, drop it--
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
I got you a present.
You get mugged or something?
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Jesus Christ.
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the ï¿½bermensch!
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
They'll never take me alive.
