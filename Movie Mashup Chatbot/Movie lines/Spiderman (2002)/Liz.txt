Let me see.
Be nice.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Flash, get lost.
Hm.  What a lump.
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
What if you get hurt?
Even if they're not clever.
He knew.
I don't think he wants me to find him.
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
Why?
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Peter?
Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part isï¿½ what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I know what you mean.  I...
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Do you mind if I come too?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
Oh, don't do it on my account--
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
What's your problem?
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
What are you doing this weekend?
Hurry up, Flash!
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Some prep school thing.
You should write that one down.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
I hate people with alliterative names.
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
Uh is a good start.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
