I know.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
No, no.
Oh, sure.
Remember Little League?
No�not really.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
You stop him?
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
No. No, that's okay.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Mm-hmm.
Don't be pitiful.
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
I know.  I've got one too.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Harry�
Harry!
What's in there?
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Right.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Are you okay?
That's not even close.
Now tell me you love me.
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Mr. Jameson--
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Mr. Jameson--
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Can't focus...
Can we make it a hundred?
Yeah--
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
How about tomorrow?
A spider.  Eight legs.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Nah.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
I... I like you.  A lot.
Hello, Liz.
I'm here...
Strong...
Oh, God, I forgot to--
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
You'd feel what?
Well, no.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
I think I'd like that.
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
I've got no problems.
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
I'm sure you kept warm.
Hi, Adele.
I've gotta study.
I'd never admit that.
Does it have a human name?
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
But you like that in a man?
What?
I suppose.
My my.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Thank God.
I hate--
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I-- uh--
Huh?
It's too early to be clever.
Good morning, Liz.
How is he?
Aunt May, what happened?
It's fine.  Tell me what--
A match made in heaven.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
What the hell is that?
The record--
No.
It's Friday night...
I'm a photographer, remember?
I'll introduce you.
I am old enough to--
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
I'll try. Thanks.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Need any more help?
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Really, Professor, I--
Actually, I got this spider bite�
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or�
No�
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
