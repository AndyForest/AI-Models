I'm always here, Pete.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
Cause if you get in a bind--
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
So, uh... how's college goin'?
What, want a glass?
Here you go, Pete.
