Precise equipment� such as waldos�
Any sign of our friend?
Peter-- my condolences.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Of course.
I know him.
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Waldos.
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
So you've found Thorkel?
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
No. It isn't.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Creation? Or its opposite?
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
A bit melodramatic� but if you could prove it� that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
How much do you know about it?
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Your dog ate it.
Peter, what can I do for you?
Mr. Parker.
No, no!  Not there!
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Do you... live around here?
Loonytunes.  And yet...
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become� whatever it is you are?
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
You're sure you're all right.
Right.  Let's go.
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
