Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
Fine.
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
Would you cool it already?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Well...
Thanks, I already ate.
Just call me Spidey.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
What?
So they're airing this tonight?
Like it?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
I'm not so happy myself.
Phooey on that.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Just drop me off here.
Bonkers.
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Imagine how I feel.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
