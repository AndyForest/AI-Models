Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Don't do it, Rob!
Anna Moss.
Anna.
Nobody.
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
You'd love it!
A couple blocks!  About six!
He's got one!
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
That's what I said.
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Nothing.
Oh well.  Nevermind.
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
It's the new --
It's Vince and Justin.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
Well we rang $900 today.
Do it.  Do it.
Rob --!
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
Rob.
I want a tape.
Yeah.
Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
Are you all right?
Can I help you?
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Well, I'll just make it for you.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
I'll tape it for you.
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
