Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Maybe I should talk to him.
You look upset.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Think about it, Rob.
So shall we leave it at that then?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Think about it, Rob.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
