Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
I knew this was going to happen.
And after that?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well call her mother.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
How's the store?
Everything all right?
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
