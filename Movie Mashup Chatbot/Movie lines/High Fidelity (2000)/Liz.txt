If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Enough of what?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
What difference does it make?
It's a crematorium.
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
How're you holding up?
You called this morning?
Hey.  It's Liz.
