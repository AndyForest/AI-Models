Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
What's his name?
Nice friend.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Fine.  That's great.
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Is there a difference?
Your desert island top-five.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
So.  Is now a good time?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
