Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
Alison's.
Do I know you?
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
Sonic Death Monkey.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
Like fuck you are.
So?  You even said they're good.
What?
No way.
Not really.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Fuck off, Barry.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Laura.  Her dad died.
Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
None.  Christ!
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Isn't it?
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
What band?
What the fuck is that?
Terrific.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
How do you know about that?
Ha.
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Why would they care?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
What do you mean, "what?"
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
What did you tell her about the shop for?
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
But now I kind of like it.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
What did he ever do to you?
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Not the point.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Nice, Barry.
We'll do it next Monday.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Say it.
What's next?
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin City."
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Yeah.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Is that it?
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
What do you mean, four more?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Pardon me?
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
Oh.  Okay.
Right.  Why?
Uh.  That's me.
May I help you?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?
Huh?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Hey Charlie.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Yeah, sure...
Who's that?
What is this.
Can I do anything?
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
-- FUCK OFF!
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Let's not.
I always hated this song.
I understand, Dick.
Fine.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
What's this?
Okay.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
No, that's okay.  Really.
Great.
Good weekend?
'Morning, Dick.
I dunno.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
I dunno.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
What needs sorting out?
Can I help you?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
Fair enough.
Are you persuadable?
I don't know.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Would you marry me if I was?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
I mean it.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
I'm going to talk to you.
Not really.
I know.  I don't get it.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
WHAT?
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
Ha.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
Where?
Nothing.
Hi.
No use.
You're being stupid.
I'm alright.
Harder.
You're tougher.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
No, but...
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Okay.
Oh, great...
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
You know the difference.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
What it was like.
C'mon.  I want to know.
Okay.
Mission accomplished.
What about Ian?
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Laura...
Look, we can do other things.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
You know, with Ray...
Hi.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
What?
When are you going back?
What do you want to do?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
What do you mean?
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Mmnn.
Uh... No.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
Yes, of course.
Do you want me to be there?
Me?
No, no.  When are you going home?
Who the fuck's Pig?
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Are you alright?
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Hey, how ya doin'?
I guess I am.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
Sure they are.
Don't forget your CDs.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
You know I'm a good person.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
That bad, eh?
You still together?  Going all right?
It was kind of funny.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
Is that the last of it?
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
Are you still in love with me?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
It's me.
You do, huh.
I don't have your number.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Nothing.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
I guess.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Have you slept with him yet?
Great... That's great.
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Hi.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Never?
I don't know.
Of course it is.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Is it better?
You won't like it.
It sounds stupid.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Yeah.  Great.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
What, what?
No.
I don't know.
Just the obvious stuff.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
Not really.
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
But don't you remember?
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
-- Alright, alright but --
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
My house?
Are you coming home?
Hi.
Shit!
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Well stay for tonight, then.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Enough, Liz.
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Is Ray going?
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
Well she --
It's true!
What's the -- hey, Liz --
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
What's happenin'.
Rob here.
I'll call you.
That way.
Which way are you going?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
Yeah.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Oh, right.  Alright.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Whiskey.
I'm sure it isn't.
Yes.  You?
Nor have you!
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
I understand completely.
You share a place with T-Bone?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
It's a great song.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
Hi, Marie.
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
So you live in Chicago now?
Good.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
Hello?  Anybody there?
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
She left.  She's gone.
So so.  Up and down.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
Hi, Mom.
Yeah?
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Thirteen hundred.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
But you must have --
These are worth at least, I don't know --
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Nice.
Whatever.
We're not there yet, Justin.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
Fuck off.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
I think you have more.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
