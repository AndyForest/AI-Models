How about any guys on your staff?
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
Is it your vehicle?
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
What d'you mean, "bits."
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
I guess by the bed.
Listen, you don't havta come?
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
I'm going up to the institute.
Jesus. What are you doin?
That's just what I wanna find out.
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Are you sure you didn't call?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
No .. You didn't know that ..
<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?"
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
Sure.
She wasn't lying about the van.
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Car accident.
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
You looked like you did?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You believe me, don't you?
I was wrong.
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
What do you want it for?
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
Why?
I haven't got it.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
We're going.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
What do you mean, Ross?
What do you mean?
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
How'd you do it, old man?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Maybe?
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
It's a method for quitting smoking.
I already did. What's his problem?
There's nothing in the files?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
What time is it?
Not too good in daylight ..
O.K.
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
Not for me ..
Who is who?
Yeah, he can go ...
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
I think you're here all day.
What about that kid, Ross?
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
I hope I'm not intruding?
I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
No.
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
That's bullshit,
Once.
Three or four.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
No, Sir.
No.
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
What do you want me to do, Chief?
I thought it was Taylor's case?
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Maybe he's lying to you?
No .. But we have a theory ..
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Is this normal?
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
He ain't offerin me shit.
I know what a "witness" is.
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
<u>You</u> put it in there.
Vehicle references.
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
Yes, Sir.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
I think they're gonna arrest me.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
You do?
He doesn't need my help.
He don't know that. I didn't.
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
No .. not now ..
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
It's not possible right now.
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
Has he got your aunt's address?
You know? How do you know?
I have to talk to you, Helena.
Which is what?
He said that? What else did he say?
Really? What did he say?
How d'you know what I'm like?
I was married to her sister ..
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
Pray?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
No.
No.
What are you reading?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Of course I would ..
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
What color was it?
Did Amber have a dog?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Me?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
Can I see your hands?
The elevator wasn't working?
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
No.
You must have some idea about him.
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
Who sought the warrant?
You got a warrant for this?
Why?
What are you doing, Travis?
