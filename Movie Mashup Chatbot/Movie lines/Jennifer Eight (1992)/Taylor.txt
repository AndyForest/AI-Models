I've heard you call him Freddy.
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
Bullshit.
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
Wrong cabinet.
What are you looking for?
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
