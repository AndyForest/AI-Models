You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
And did they?
He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
Have you got a print from the hand?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
I don't see that at all ..
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
How do you know her hair's black?
What is that?
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Interview over, Blattis ...
