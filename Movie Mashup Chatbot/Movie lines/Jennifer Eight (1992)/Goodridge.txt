I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
You find something curious in that?
