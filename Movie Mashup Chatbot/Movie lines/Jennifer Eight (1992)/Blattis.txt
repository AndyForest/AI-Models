Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
Did he get you the job?
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
What does that mean, Sergeant?
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
