I don't want them to arrest you.
I wanna be near you ...
I'm blind because my father drank.
I know about alcohol, John.
Then why didn't he kill me?
I can't identify him ..
Why does he want to kill me?
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
I'm going back to the institute.
Why?
Why can't I stay with you?
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
No I'm not.
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
I know.
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
Just your age.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Ross told me.
I know what you're like ..
Have you known her long?
Sorry?
You said, you were in the bad lands?
Do you pray?
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Are you married?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Oh.
Are you wearing a uniform?
You should. It's wonderful.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
It was probably the wind.
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
Have you been here long?
I don't know.
Yes.
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
No.
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
My hands?
No, it has a mind of its own.
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
Why not? You heard my voice?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
Is that Margie?
Don't mix very well with beer.
You think John would like it?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
You think he still loves her?
What does that mean?
What was she like?
When did John divorce?
