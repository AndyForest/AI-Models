You ain't going in alone?
What if we need a back up?
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
Bits.
It's twenty of three.
Where's your watch?
Hey ..
Now?
What exactly you doing, John?
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
What about Citrine?
I dunno what I can do to help you?
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Ease off, John ..
I'm asking it.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
You don't really believe this?
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
Stop it.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
Why's she blind, Bro?
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
Did I say he did?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Did he shut you down?
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
That isn't what you said before.
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
Listen to me saying what?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
You want me to stop the car?
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
To throw out of the window.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
Then give me that Zippo.
Pay me, and I shut up.
So am I. But where's my money?
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
No, you didn't.
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Thank Christ we got a witness.
Where is everyone?
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
Because I dislike her too much ..
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Someone bet me a dollar ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
You gotta stop smoking ..
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
You want my advice?
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
Because, don't get into it ...
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is "God's Country," John.
What does that mean?
How's the new residence?
Since when did you drink diet soda?
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
The <u>dogs</u>?
What do you think?
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
"Welcome to Eureka."
You heard. Look for the knife.
Be my guest. What you got?
Did you bring it with you?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
Yeah, I guess I do.
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
She married some English prick.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
Even better.
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Shut up, King Jay ..
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
Whass going on here?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Ask him.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
He has? .. What's he doing here?
I'm already walking. Where is it?
