That's a better one.
That way. I can feel the cold.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
I knew you would come.
Yes.
All directions are the same here.
I don't know how.
All the passages are guarded.
Colwyn ...
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
I know it.
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
Colwyn ...
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
Colwyn.
About what?
I can't.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
We're almost married.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
I have no intention of getting used to it.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
Me too.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
He will come for me.
He will not!
It's a lie!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
