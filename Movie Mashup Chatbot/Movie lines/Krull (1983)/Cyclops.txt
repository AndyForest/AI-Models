Yes. It is today.
I road them often in my youth.
They can be saddled.
Do not let the waters touch you.
We must enter the swamp.
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
And mine goes with you.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
A small house.

We'll meet you at the inn.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
I am Quell.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
Would you settle for a boar?
