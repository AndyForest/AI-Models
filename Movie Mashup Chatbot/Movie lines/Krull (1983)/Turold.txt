You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
You will go alone.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
Of course it was.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
A fine match.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
That I am, my lady.
I knew.
It is important to assure the succession.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
How many did you lose?
Yes. We lost five.
