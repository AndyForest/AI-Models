What else is left for a man without friends.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
My <u>friend</u>.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
Once is enough, thank you.
Staying alive.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
For that rudeness, peasant lout, I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart. Which is right now.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
My heart stays here.
Quell?
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
A venison pie as big as a house.
Can't I come, too?
Where are you going?
I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
What is that awful looking place?
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
You!
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
You do?
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
Sugarballs?
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
Hush!
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Oh, my poor stew!
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
Food for crows.
And do you think I live on air?
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
Put me down, you lout!
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
They'll trample him to death!
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
