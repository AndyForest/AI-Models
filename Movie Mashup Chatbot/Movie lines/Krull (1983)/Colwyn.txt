Yes.
In the Arctic ice.
Lyssa ...
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
Take the western passage.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
Will your power outward.
You must move away from the Center.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
I will find you. I will be with you.
Where is the Fortress?
Lyssa ...
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Have they harmed you?
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
I can't wait either.
I lied.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
<u>What</u>?
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Well, you're beautiful.
That's worse.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
I don't have to go through with it either.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
I won't leave you here.
They have Lyssa!
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
I forbid you!
No! You cannot know that!
You're coming with us.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
She can see the Beast!
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
Where the spiral begins.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
The Beast will kill her.
Let us wish him peace.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
Never.
Can she be forced?
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Yes.
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
But you suspect.
<u>Why</u>?
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
I cannot reach her.
I will find her!
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
I can't reach her.
They know when they're going to die?
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
The Fortress moves?
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
There is nothing.
You won't have to.
You have rope?
But there is another entrance to this place.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
I have no extraordinary powers.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
The new Queen lives.
The White Castle has fallen.
Each to his fate.
It is today?
Saddles.
You have done it?
What will happen?
Slayers!
How did you know?
I cannot.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
I cannot betray my bride.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
I ache with it.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I don't think that.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
You and I will guard the fire.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
I have need of friends.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
He saved our lives.
What business?
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
At the gallop!
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Go. I command you.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Go, join them.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
Hand over your dinner.
These we'll pay for.
We must try to get horses.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
No.
I'm not hungry.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
I'm all right.
That I promise you.
To the place where Death lives.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
You will follow me.
I know you.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Fame.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
