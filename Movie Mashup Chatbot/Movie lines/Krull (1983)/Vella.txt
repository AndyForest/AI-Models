You will not, then?
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Let me comfort you.
You too are lonely.
Even by you?
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Am I not worth returning to?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
