Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
An INCIDENT?
Onscreen.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
According to my information, today.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
Surely not.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
You having hearing problems, mister?
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
What?
Praxis?
What is it?
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Visual!
Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
