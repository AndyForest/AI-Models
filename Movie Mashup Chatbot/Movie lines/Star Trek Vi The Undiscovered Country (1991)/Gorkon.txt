Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
I shall look forward to it.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Thank you, Captain.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
