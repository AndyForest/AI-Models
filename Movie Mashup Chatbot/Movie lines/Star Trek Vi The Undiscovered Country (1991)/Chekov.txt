If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
We're explorers not diplomats!
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
Course heading, Captain?
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Shields up. Battle stations.
But if she's cloaked...
Where IS the conference?
From Starfleet?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Torpedo room--?
Just the size of my head -
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Where is Mr. Sulu?
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
ALL uniforms?
Now we go to Starfleet?
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Shields up, Captain --?
