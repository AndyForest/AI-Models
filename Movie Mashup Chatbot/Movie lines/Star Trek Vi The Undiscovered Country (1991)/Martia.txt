I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
It takes a lot of effort.
They'll respect him now...
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
They'll make it look like an accident...
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
I know how to get outside the shield.
It IS possible.
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
There's a reward for your death.
Krandog aranty.
And your coat.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
