He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt?
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Max, I...
Liebkind, no!
What???
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
No way out.  No way out.
To failure!
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Do you think he'll take the job?
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
What is she gonna do here?
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
What are you doing?
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
Who wrote it?
It won't run a week!
You found a flop!
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Right.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Coney Island??
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Oh.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
You're going to jump on me.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
What scheme?
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
Yes, it's quite possible.
What was I saying?
Yes, what?
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
But that's cheating!
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Mr. Bialystock ...
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
It's nothing ... nothing.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Well, sir, it seems ...
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Yes sir.
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady.
Scared.  Can't talk.
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
Ooooooops.
I'll wait in the hall ...
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Okay.
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
People can hear you.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
