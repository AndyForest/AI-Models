Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name?
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
Congratulations.
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
"Keep a shining in...
"Honeymoon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
"I want to croon,
"Of the silvery moon,
Don't help me.
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
What is it?
What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Shut up.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
Double.  Double.  Double.
I never should have listened to you.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
Maybe it's not true!
To failure!
Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
Only if we ask him.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Okay, take it off, take it off.
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
Maybe you're happy.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
Two pistachios, my good man.
What kind now, Leo?
Then stick with Bialystock!
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
Where would you like to eat?
I already have.  Come on.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
How's this?
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Will you get a hold on yourself.
I'm not going to jump on you!
What???
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
But what if the play was a hit?
One night.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
What did I do?
What do you mean?
Assume away!
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Help!
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
Where?  What?
Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Here, don't panic.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Good, what is it?
I have hurt your feelings.
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Do the books!  Do the books!
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Oooooooops!
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
Do you need us?
Do it!  Do it!
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Come on.  Let's get going.
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Not.
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Yes.  We would!
We swear it!
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart.
Really, I never dreamed ...
No kidding?
With whom?
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
Yes.
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Very nice girl.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
No.  We go.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Nice girl.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
Ta.  Ta.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Like clockwork.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
All right.  All right.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Here I come, ready or not.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
