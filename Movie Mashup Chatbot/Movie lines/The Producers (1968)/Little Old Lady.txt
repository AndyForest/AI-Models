Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Ta.  Ta.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
I shall count the minutes.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Oh, the best one.
We can't play today?
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Feeling better?
Finder's keepers.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
