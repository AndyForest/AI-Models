What are you saying?
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
Oh, sing.  Sing!
What do you do best?
I mean in show business.
What have you done, LSD?
