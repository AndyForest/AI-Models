Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Always.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
I don't know.  I don't know.
But he has long hair!
Vaaaat???
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Good.  I will make the preparations.
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
Vat about it?
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
Heil you know who!
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
The Blue Max...
The Graf Spee...
Hindenburg...
Bismark...
Nietzche...
Wagner...
Of Siegfried...
By the sacred memory...
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
Where are you going vit the light?
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come!
Vat?
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
