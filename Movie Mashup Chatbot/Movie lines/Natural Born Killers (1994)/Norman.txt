Unfortunately, yes.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
Yes.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
And a snake-eye glare.
Hypnotizing.
I do, too.
