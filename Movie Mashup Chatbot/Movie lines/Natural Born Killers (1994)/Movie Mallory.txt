You made every day like kindergarten.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
