It's video.
Not good.
Yes, sir.
Look, I'll trade you.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
Anything.

So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?

I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.

How immediate is immediately?
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
