Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
What gives, Don Corleone?
You better.
Let your fingers do the walking.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Very ambitious. I like that.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
That's hard to believe.
Maybe someday.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Not a chance.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I'm very aural.
That's refreshingly deviant.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I'm trembling with excitement.
Amen to that.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
Well? Where the hell are you?
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
But you never do.
I know.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
Eventually you'll let go.
It's incredibly simple.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
Your dad taught you everything.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
I doubt it.
He phoned it in.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
He didn't. He had it built.
To the best hiding place in the world.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Is this an gritty exposï¿½ or a candy ass press release?
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Interesting.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Then I'll write about YOU.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
In what sense?
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
