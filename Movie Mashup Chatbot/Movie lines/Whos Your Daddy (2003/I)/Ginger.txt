Well?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Ted! Do something!
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Teddy? I was thinking.
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Who exactly ARE you?
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
That's me.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
It's your car. These are all your cars.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
Want a lesson?
You do know how to drive?
They're in the ignition, silly.
