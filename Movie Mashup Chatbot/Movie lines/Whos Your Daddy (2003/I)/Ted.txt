Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Get them together.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
I thought I loved her.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Give me those!
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
And some really fast cars.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
What is it now?
I better go, Dad.
So far away? In Xenia?
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Not ever. Never.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Perv.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Maybe he got promoted.
Well, Dad said...
Astronomical.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
I defy any and all limits.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Someday, I'll find out.
Were you always this sick?
See? Did you see that?
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
You and your pep talks.
God, you are so hot.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
You have changed since second grade.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
That was code for "I like you."
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
Do it?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
Yeah? You like?
So that's a maybe?
So you'll think about it?
But that smile.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Ladies first.  I insist.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
It's okay. You need me?
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
Finally, some gratitude.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
Just say it, Dad.
...not the pit.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Yeah.
I guess.
Well, why should I?
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
You guys are my parents.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Dad, please.
It's my private business! Mine!
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
What do you want me to do?
Of course we were.
Whatever you want.
Hmmm?
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Hi ho, Silver.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
The one with the horses.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
Some of them have to be automatics.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Got it.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I-I don't have the keys.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
My legacy.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
You mean they knew who I was?
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
You're on the next plane home.
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Great.
I didn't forget.
That's a crappy thing to say.
He was my Grandfather, too.
You're a peach.
I miss them, too.
Are they okay?
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
You want it in writing?
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
It's not up to me.
My room?
Very funny.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
Most places are, Jimmy.
It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
James, what are you doing here?
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Yellow pages?
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
You're quick. I like that.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
But absolutely true.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I want you to trust me.
Come on.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
I see.
Tell me more.
What about you?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
Let's do it.
He's on the move?
That's probably my office.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
You're amazing.
And then what?
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
It's all so complicated.
I mean my father.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
I see.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
Whatever.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Where are we going?
Wow...you clean up nice.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
Well? What do you think of her?
A little respect would be nice, that's all.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Don't write that part.
You never know around here.
I guess.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
I don't get the distinction.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
Really? You wanna write about me?
Me?
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
I'm trying to help.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Your article sucked.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
I have absolutely no intention--
Me-ow.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos� changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
Forget the store. Think big.
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
I'll make you very proud.
Only the best for my mother.
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Well? Surprised?
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
You called the cops on us?
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
Yes?
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
My father must've been amazing.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
That's perfect.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
You think we should be more open minded?
What kind of ideas?
My parents always say hard work builds character.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
Really? You'd do that for me?
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
I was like a different person tonight.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
Me? The King of Coitus?
I do?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
Tipping?
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Seldom? No kidding?
As much as possible.
Of course I like girls.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
My parents? What do you mean?
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
People pay good money for that?
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
