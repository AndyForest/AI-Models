We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
We miss you. We miss our son.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We love our lives just the way they are.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We own a small family grocery store.
I will not have my boys arguing.
Watch your tone, mister.
You ordered a Winnebago?
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
Sorry I--
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Whatever helps you cope.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Son.
Of course we are.
I'm getting so good at this.
The lesson being?
You're way ahead of me again?
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
