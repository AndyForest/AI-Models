From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
I meant biologically.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Just a formality.
If you could just sign right there.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
My new bike.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
