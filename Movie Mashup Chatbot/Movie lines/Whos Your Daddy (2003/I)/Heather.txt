So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
Can you believe that was me?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
