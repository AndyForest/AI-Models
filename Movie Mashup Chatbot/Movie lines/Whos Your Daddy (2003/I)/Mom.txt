We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
We miss our family.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
Sweetheart, what is it?
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
But who would run the store?
Like what?
Oh. Goodness.
But how would we pay our bills?
You promise you'll finish school?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
That's part of growing up, honey.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
