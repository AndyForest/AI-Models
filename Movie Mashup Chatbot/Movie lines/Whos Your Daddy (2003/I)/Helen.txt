But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
I understand.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
