Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
How quaint.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
It's about your parents.
I'm just a messenger.
Bad news.
In a hurry, are we?
