Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
I mean, what do you think?
Well?
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
Which you pulled, hard!
You know...take the pictures?
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
If you don't have...I mean...
And I was wondering.
Well. The prom's coming up.
You go first.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
