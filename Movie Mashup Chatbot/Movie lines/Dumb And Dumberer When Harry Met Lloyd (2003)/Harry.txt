Oh my god, are you alright?
Actually we have something for you.
You're it.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Hey look, it's our teacher.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Okay.
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Coming.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
I'm fine.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
Yeah, but I'm buying.
Ooh gross.
Gotcha.
O'clock?
Excuse me?
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Heddo Jeth-ica.
HARRY Dunne.
Four colors? Neato!
Yeah. How'd you know?
Depends how you define 'new'...
In the new library there.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Well la de da.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Mom, you know that never works.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
I know I am, Mom.
You know Mom, like in the pool.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
I'm just not ready.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
I know.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
Sorry, Charlie.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
Well, what should we do?
She's one of a kind.
What?
The one on the left.
Right.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Start the tape, Lloyd.
You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Guys, this is much better.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
Wait, wait!
Ready Lloyd?
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
And like she said, do it before the parade.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
What? What did we do?
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
Do you know what this means?
I don't know who we are anymore.
I... found that rock.
I made the polar bear pants.
But my mom gave me the map.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
Well, I'm listening now.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
Cute puppy.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Hey, it's Jessica.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Are, too.
You're it.
I know I did.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
Who?
A blimp.
No. What happened?
Me, me, me!
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Go away, assface.
You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.
But-
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Hey, where did you come from?
You have beautiful eyes.
Yes.
Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
I don't think so.
I kinda screwed things up.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Shut up!
You can't marry my mom.
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
Some what?
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Yea!
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Who's your partner?
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Wanna bet?
How do you know it's for us?
What?
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
...cause you said...
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
Owww.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
I don't know. Owwww.
Owww... refreshing.
These are really cold, huh?
Can he do that?
You're it.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
Nice jugs.
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
I didn't know that.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
No.
HARRY.
Collins is a great man!
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
You're not my real dad.
Shut up!
Will not.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
She did not.
What?
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
Just a guy I hang out with.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Go fish.
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
One day they'll find a cure.
The second R is silent.
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
Oh, is this your special place?
Wow.
Who's Principal Collins?
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Me too!
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
No.
Why not?
Don't we want them to talk to us?
What?
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
No, it's a treasure map.
I think it's just over there.
I go to school where I live.
Home school. Til today.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Probably because we've never met.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
