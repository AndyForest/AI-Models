That's gross.
Hey, where'd you go?
You take her.
Try one in a million!
That's the one I wanted.
Damn! What are the odds?
Okay. Which one do you want?
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
And with that complete loser
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
Roger that, Wilco.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
A float!
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I lugged it all over town!
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
No. Look.
D2.
Am not.
Sorry, no further questions.
You certainly did.
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
Hello, he only invented money!
George Washington!
A turd.
A raft.
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
The answer is George Jefferson.
No one knows?
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Captain Rob came back?
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
HARRY! I found the treasure!
HARRY!
HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
So, have you given him "some" yet?
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Hey, where did you come from?
You have beautiful eyes.
HARRY, can you hear me?
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
You're always your harshest critic.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Sure I do. On one condition.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
That's a cow, Harry.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Sucks for you.
Nope. I was right.
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
Our own special bus.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
HARRY! Here he comes.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
And my mouph is frozen.
Put some ice on it.
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
You're it.
They can't be real.
And he invented fire.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Don't look directly at him.
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
Now you see why he was elected principal?
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
Kids.
Where did you learn that word?
You take that back!
I will stop this car right now.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Your mom made a move on me.
Whoa. What was that?
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
Exactly! A pirate!
Peg leg?
Yeah, he's a pirate.
Sounds like a pirate.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Who's Captain Rob?
Got any crazy eights?
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
You brave soldier.
Oh, of course.
H A R R Y...
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
The principal.
Shift to your left.
Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
No no no no no.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
You're it.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
Cool.
Is that what I think it is?
Me too!
Home school? What's that?
I haven't seen you around here before.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
Looks like the best man won.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
Me too. I'm almost there.
What are you doing?
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Oh, go on.
Tomorrow night?
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
I know, you want go for a ride.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Why ith dat newth?
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
You really are a pirate.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Do I know you?
You were born free and free you should remain.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
That's the downside. There is none.
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Uh-oh. Harry?
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
Do we have a deal?
Go in there and get us two slushees.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Oh yeah, give it to me.
Have you got what I want?
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Hey can be on top?
I liked it a lot.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
Thanks, Pop.
Obviously.
Or maybe crossing a river!
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
Will that be on the midterm?
