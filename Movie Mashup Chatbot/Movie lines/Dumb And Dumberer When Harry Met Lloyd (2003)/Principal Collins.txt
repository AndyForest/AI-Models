Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Not to expect you tonight.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
Oh I think you do.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
You had some questions.
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
Just like the President.
Everything. Just for the record.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
What?
Who's there?
And you are great in bed.
And, take some more pictures.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
Yes!
I think you'll make a good teacher.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
And I you.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
