Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
What? No! Look.
Okay, what?
What are you wearing?
What?
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
HARRY? Are you okay?
Just down the hall.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Would you like something to drink?
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
Yeah...
Come over around seven.
You and Lloyd chose the class!?
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
You did?
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
HARRY!
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
Hey guys.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Excuse me.
Hi.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
You mean the lunch room?
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
So can I come along?
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
That's not your tape.
I don't know what you're talking about.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
TURK, what are you doing here?
TURK, leave him alone.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
That's my boyfriend.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
That's it. I'm done.
I'm so close I can feel it.
Let's just do it and get out of here.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
Well, something stinks.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
So, when can we do it?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
What?
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
What are you doing here?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Yes, what?
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
I'll talk to you later.
