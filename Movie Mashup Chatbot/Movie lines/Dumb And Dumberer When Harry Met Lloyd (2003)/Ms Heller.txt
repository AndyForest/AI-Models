I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
I thought I told you to get lost.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Oh, you're good.
No.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
No.
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
What the hell are you talking about?
I think you did it.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
Left here! Left!
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
What?
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
This is horse?
Love it!
This band sounds terrible.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
Are you going to kill her?
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Where is it?
The evidence of what?
What papers?
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
Oh, just like the President.
Everything?
So what do you keep in there?
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
You got the Extender?
It's a surprise.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Knock knock.
Wow, you are smart.
And...?
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
Times two.
Oh wow. Look at you.
You said "aloha" twice.
We start our own class?
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
It's the big potato.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
God, I've missed you.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
