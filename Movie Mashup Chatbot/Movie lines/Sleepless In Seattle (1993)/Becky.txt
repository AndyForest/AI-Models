I love the symphony.
What are your plans in New York?
You're going to miss the train.
What about the letter?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
M.F.E.O.?
So I mailed your letter.
This is a photo of hair.
You don't know who she was, Annie --
It's a sign --
But he saw you, right?
I love that dream.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
I love you, too.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
What?
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
Did you talk to him?
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
Turn on your radio!

Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
What?
Right.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
You're a basket case.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
What's with you?
What was that about up there?
It's not true, but it feels true.
Whatever it is.
You should write something about this.
