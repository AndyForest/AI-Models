The one in the street.  I chased after you.
It's you.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Hello.
Magic.
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Sure you do --
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Why me? What about Jay?
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
The cabinets have to be redone --
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling.
I don't think I could really describe it.
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
It's hard to imagine.
What's she talking about?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
No.
It's been about a year and a half.
All righ...
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
Who is this?
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
Hello.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
What is it?
What's tira misu?
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Seventy... eight.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
I can't believe you flew first class.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
When I found you?
What if I couldn't get to you?
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
Get out.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Did not.
This conversation is finished.
Shut up.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Yes.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Have you seen my wallet?
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Who is Annie?
God, she's beautiful.
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Everyone at work heard you.
Did you call that radio station again?
That's true.  Why is that?
There's a bathroom upstairs.
What are you doing up?
Don't ever do that again.
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Jonah!
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
She's going to cook something for us?
There she is.
Perfect.  We'll be there.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed.
Oh, right.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Not now, Jonah --
Now I'm late.  Bye.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut.
This one's for both of us.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I don't know.
Is that what she used to sing?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
What was?
I know.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Go to sleep.
Whose show was this on?
What?
What do you think?
I'm starting to notice that.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
How did they get our phone number?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Sure.  Looking good.
Fine.  Fine.
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
What?
Does red pepper go under R or P?
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Oh, you're changing your mind --
You're right.  You better hope so.
What?!
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
My feelings exactly.
It's never happening again. Right?
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
I don't think I have to now.
What is it?
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Yes?
Hi.
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
What do you mean?
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
Microwave.  Five minutes.
Sure.  Sure.
It takes time --
I read an article about this ...
He's ten.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
You could have called me --
You did?
You look good.
Hi.
