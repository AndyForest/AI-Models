Why not?
What was it that made you know?
What are you going to do, Sam?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
Why not?
Have you had any relationship since?
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Fair enough.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
Is he home right now?
You want me to talk to him?
Why not?
And you're worried about him.
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
Where's your mom?
You don't like the one he was now?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
