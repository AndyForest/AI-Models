Howard.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Are you Annie?
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
Please --
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
I don't know --
Yeah.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
No.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
She died.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
It's not that late in Seattle.
I don't know.  Do I?
Window.
But how am I going to get there?
Eighty dollars.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
I don't get it.
Yeah.  What's that?
You think so?
Dad, could you close the door?
Sure.
Okay.
It was all they had.
No.
No.
If I didn't go.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
No.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Did too.
You said we could go to New York.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
What's wrong with Annie?
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
This is the one I like.
Are you going with her?
It might be in the kitchen.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
The one who wrote us.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Victoria? She's okay.
Was Mom an adjustment?
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
It's a short word.
I just called for a second.
No.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
I was thirsty.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Okay.
It's only ten o'clock.
Why is she bringing that bag?
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
It's a sign.
Dad!
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Listen to this --
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
This is a good letter, Dad.
Great.
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Good.
I'm starting to forget her.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
Bye bye blackbird.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
It was sinking.
How do you know?
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
Jed's got cables.
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Will she scratch up your back?
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
-- a slice of pizza --
English muffin.  How do you do it?
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
She's willing to fly anywhere.
Somewhere in the middle.
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Stressed.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
So I can go.
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
P.  Dad?
Dad --
No, I'm not, but --
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
It plays in 50 states.
Not.
Right.
Dad?  About last night?
It's a spice rack.
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
Dad --
I think they're announcing your flight.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Do you like it?
What about camping?
Do you like baseball?
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
