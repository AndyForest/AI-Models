How can anyone be that naive?
What?
Why did you take the money?
You're already alone.
Here...use a spoon.
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
Nothing about you.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
Really?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
You were talking in your sleep.
You will?
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
I hope it brings you luck.
No. Answer it!
The door, Jack.
Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
I don't like it.
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Are you drunk?
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
I loved it blond.
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
You're shaking. What is it?
How did it go?
What's the time?
You've got such beautiful hands.
I love you Jack, you know that.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
How did you land that?
What job?
I want to hear it.
You're my prisoner.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Where did you get it?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I won't be that long.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
I couldn't resist them.
