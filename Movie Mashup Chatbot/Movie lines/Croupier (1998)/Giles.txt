How's that football story corning along?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
And your lady?
Good night?
Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.
I get it.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Who was he?
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
Looking forward!
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
All right. As what?
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
