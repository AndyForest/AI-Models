What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
You're all scumbags.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Sorry.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
I got scared.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
All men are cheats.
You're shaking.
I'll take you up on that.
My car's in the garage.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
How do I look?
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
I'm Bella.
