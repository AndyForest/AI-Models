Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
How do you feel, Jack?
She was a real asset. But what could I do?
Thanks for the information.
I can see.
He's a good customer.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
That hair will have to go.
You can start Monday week.
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
Girlfriend?
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
Ever?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
I said good call.
Good call.
What makes you so sure?
I make it six.
How many aces are left?
You won't. Not without permission.
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
Wipe your hands.
Haven't you forgotten something?
They've been tested.
We do.
Give me 365.
Any exceptions?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
We check every four days.
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
Where did you go to school?
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
