Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I'll tell you later.
Rough life, Jack.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
Hey Jack, join us.
That bitch? No.
Good call. Help yourself.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
What are you, a cop?
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
She's my baby.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Have you got transport?
Where do you live, Jack?
