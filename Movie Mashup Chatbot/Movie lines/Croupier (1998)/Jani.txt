Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Jack! It's Jani.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Would you like a drink?
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Do you?
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Thank you.
Is it yes?
I have to take the car.
I'm sorry.
I told you, all bets are off.
Let it go.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
I want you to forget what I said.
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
Next time it'll be my neck.
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
It won't.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
The point is, they want a man inside.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
They mean it.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
I know that. But you can now.
I owe a lot of money.
I'm in trouble.
I didn't.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
Which side do you like?
You don't like cheats, do you.
What happened?
He doesn't gamble.
That's fine.
Just an accident. Nothing.
Toss you for it.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Do you believe in astrology?
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Near the casino.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
To coincidence.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
Well, thank you anyway.
You know where I'm from?
