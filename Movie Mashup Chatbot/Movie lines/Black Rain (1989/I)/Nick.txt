Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
I hope not.
You said that in the last two places.
Let's grab some food.
I said let's go, Charlie.
Let's go.
In Rome, I'll bow.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Number five with a bullet.
No.
What'd you say?
Not a prayer.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Saving your life.
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Some party.
Frank Abolofia.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
-- I should tear your head off.
Charlie...
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Get rid of it.
What's this?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Home.
Thanks.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Are you expecting anyone?
Give me a break, would you?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Connie...
Short shift?
We can't lose.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
Call for help.
You all right?
Why's that?
What's that for?
Me too.
A wife.  She left.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Joyce?
How many men?
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
You did great, Ichiro.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
Start it.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Let's go.  Him first.
So I bring some cheese?
What's in the box?
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Big enough.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
I want to go talk to him.
Where does this Sugai live?
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
I want to yank Kobo.
Shut-up.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
Gaiijin.
She disappeared... shit!
Good.  Very good...
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Ichiro --
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Are we getting married?
Did I say that?
What'd I tell you?
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
What's he saying?
A snitch?
Know her?
How'd you get this?
I can see that.
Yeah...
Why weren't you at the platform?
What happened?
Why the hell not?
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
Give us a break...
What's the problem here?
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
I'd like that.
Might be different in New York.
Can't make you change your mind?
What if I chant?
Why would you care?
No one's keeping him here.
We're in?
Tell them I'm not.
Who am I supposed to be?
I don't remember you saying no.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
What do you chant?
Where's the wife?
He drinks.
You could fake it.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
I need someone to translate for me.
Unavailable.
I need your help, Joyce.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
He's on duty.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
You have a helluva way of answering.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Gaiijin?
There was a change in plans.
Don't give him any more.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
I'm amused.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Guess I'm on a roll.
Save it, I already took the tour.
I'm taking you back.
Right.
He killed a police officer.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
He was my partner.
Why me?
What...?  What if I say no?
What?
Why?
Yeah.
Not in that company.
This by this...
I have to get to Sugai.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
What's this?
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
Because I want you to tell me.
Could you fill me in?
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
We're police officers.
I want a gun.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
That wasn't our deal.
Good.
I don't have to.
If I say no?
With these?
You trust me?
Why tell me this?
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
The families who control the casinos?
I want him.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
