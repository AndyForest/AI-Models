Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
I still think you're a bastard.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
You'll get Ich killed.
The cheese...
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
They want your autograph.
I don't remember saying yes.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
You met her.
He's got a reason.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
And I'm supposed to care?
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
Where's Ich?
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I paid for that.
Don't be an ass.
She ever pull down her shades?
I don't think so.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
I don't give tours.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
Ich said you left.
He gets as much as he wants.
