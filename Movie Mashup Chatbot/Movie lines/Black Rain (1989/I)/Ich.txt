What does Charlie mean?
Cool?
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
Joyce can be nice.
Squid?
How can you be so sure?
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Louder, pal, louder.
Yes...
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Luck.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.  You have one?
Someone attacked him.
I don't know.
I couldn't tell.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
Kampai.
I can't...
No.
Nick, you can't do this.
No...
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
It's illegal, Nick.
It's very small.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
What...?  Why?
A resort city, Beppu.
Nick!
San is an honorable title.
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Nick --
I'm not drunk...
You can trust me.
I'll check it out.
You can't come in.  They don't want --
You were too far behind.
Yakuza.
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Nick...
Sure.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
There she is!
Nick...
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
I stole them.
I've continued working on the case!
I'll get him for you, Nick.
You must leave?
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
I don't, that's all.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Nick!
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
Where would you look for the mafia?
