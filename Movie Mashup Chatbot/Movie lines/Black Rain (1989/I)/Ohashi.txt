Goodbye, officer.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
You had my help, detective.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
Look.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Do you know what this is?
You're foreigners.
It is not allowed.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
