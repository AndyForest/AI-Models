Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Maybe we should bail?
Getting very weird.
This the right place?
This should be it...
First decent idea you've had.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
Nick, we can't just --
Hey, when in Rome --
I didn't know.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Nick... You up?
Where is the subway station, please.
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
What are you doing?
Maybe we should do something?
The Wolf?
What?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
Who do you think the Jap is?
What are they doing now?
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
Why?
Back-up.
Let go...
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
I think she got to you, pappy.
Hey, all right.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
You all right?  You okay?
You cool, Ich?
What'd she say?
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
