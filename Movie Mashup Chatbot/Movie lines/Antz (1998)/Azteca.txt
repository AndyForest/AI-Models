Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
Break's over.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
Someone who follows his heart!
Invisible!
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
Tell me about it.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
