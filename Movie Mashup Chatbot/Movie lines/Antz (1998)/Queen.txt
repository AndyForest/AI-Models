Bala!
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
Yes, what else?
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
