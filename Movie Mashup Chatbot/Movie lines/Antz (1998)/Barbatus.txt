Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Z!  Over here!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Superior numbers, kid!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
You new, kid?
