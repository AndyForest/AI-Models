You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Well...  I declared war!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Duty calls!
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Not that one.  Or that one.
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
Okay, son.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
ARREST HIM!
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
May I cut in?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
Affirmative.
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Alright, let's move out!
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
