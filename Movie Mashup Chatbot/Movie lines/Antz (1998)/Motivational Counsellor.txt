You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
What do you see out there?
I'm glad you asked me that question!
Ask me why we're so successful.
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
