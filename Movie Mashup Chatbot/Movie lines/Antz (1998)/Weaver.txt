Right...because every ant's important!
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
No, sir!
That's correct, sir!
I...I have no idea, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
Yeah, I know.
Wear this.
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
I can't think of any.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
Time to cut a rug, Z!
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
I'll be back.
