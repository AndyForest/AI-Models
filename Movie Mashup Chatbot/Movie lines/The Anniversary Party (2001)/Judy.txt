Not as a rule.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hm.  We should do it again.
A perfect night.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah...
Are you my big hard hero?
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
There's a test, you know.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Nice to meet you.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Ours.
The infamous dog?
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Don't be silly.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Lovely.
We have a gift?
