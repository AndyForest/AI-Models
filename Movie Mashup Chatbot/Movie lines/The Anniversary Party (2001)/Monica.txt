You have?
Excuse me?
We live next door.
Monica.
I'm so sorry.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
That's very nice.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Yes.
Medallions.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Ryan's really angry with me.
Lemon.
Okay.
What am I, five?
I'm a little in the puke zone.
I've never done this before.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
I will treasure this.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
I'll be your best friend.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
And Ryan works at home.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
A little out of my element.
I'm a little nervous, so...
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Sally did all this herself?
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Something soft.
Please, Ryan.
Let's just go home, okay?
Don't go in, Ryan.
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
He always has two or three going...
Ryan.
I...
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
Yes.
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Ryan!
We could hardly say no.
Sally?
