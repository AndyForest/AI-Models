One guess.
You're fucking desperate.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Would it make a difference?
Why didn't you come in?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
It's not going to come up.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Why would she care?
You want a Tylenol, or something?
I'd say it was down.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
Borrow whatever you like.
Oh.
Well, probably.
Oh.
Oh.
Why didn't you bring him?
Why didn't you bring him?
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
Of course.
Count on it.
Damn straight.
And you're not the wife.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
He's not going tonight.
Yeah.
Would you leave us alone right now?
Thanks for coming.
Ryan's novel.
Take your time, Jer.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
You're out of your mind.
Scout's honor.
Yes.
Whatever you say.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
We'll be fine.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
He's directing now.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Well, you're a tower of support.
We've only been over this how many times?
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
I adore him.
I love you, you're a genius.
Fantastic.  Out here.
Sure.
I know.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Ah...
He's my favorite.
It's a Calder.
Me too.
Me too.
I guess.
Okay.
You don't have to.
I'll be with you.
Everybody hates the messenger.
I know.
Yes.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
I wanted you back.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't.
Anyone else?
Cal, too?
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
It's a shit novel anyway.
I don't look my age, Joe.
What are you saying?
About me!
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
And how hard it hit?
It's not like this all the time.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Otis!!!!
Fuck you.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
She left the fucking gate open.
Don't be so sure.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Not properly watered.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Truce?
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Still champions.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
Yes.
In the kitchen.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Really?
I'm going to throw up.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
I mean, you're really back.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
No.  Did you?
What?
Through the sweats or not?
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Hardly...
Happy anniversary, baby.
No luck.
Not good.
Well...wow...
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
I didn't say a word.
Trust him.
Of course it's alright.
How long ago was it?
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I did it.
I so wish I'd known.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Are you working on a new book?
Oh?
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Panes?
We're going to have to go back out there.
Thank you, Panes.
That's not an answer, is it?
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
Thanks.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
No.  Not something new.
I never like to talk about my work.
I don't want to talk about it.
Yes.  Fine.
You're a shit.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
About five thousand dollars.  With my discount.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Shit!
Everyday.
You know it's true.
We're just feeling our way back.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
Okay.
Like the last time.
Like the last time.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Fuck you, Panes.
How?
She's all over him, are you blind?
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
Panes is here!
Will champagne help?
Are you lovesick?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Monica and Ryan.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
Relax.  You've done enough.
You don't need to do that.
What are they?
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
I'll be right out.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Why are you doing this?
Not nice.  Not kind.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Neither does Joe.
You weren't exactly horrified.
And Cal's this massive adult?
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
What do you mean, thank God?
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
And the food sucks, I know.
Oh Soph...
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Big time.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
It's much more personal in here.
So where should I put it?
She's such a great photographer.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
Nevermind.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Like Joe.
He's a novelist.
And here they are!
Enough about me.
