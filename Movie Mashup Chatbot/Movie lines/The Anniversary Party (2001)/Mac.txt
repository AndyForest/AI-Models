I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
What what's about?
I don't know how to make her funny.
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
You don't have any clothes on.
Not this time.
I'm in mourning.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
She already has.
So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
Yeah, thanks pal.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
I'm fine, babe.
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Are you always this much fun?
It was fifteen seconds.
Go.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
I meant Sally.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
You got your DP?
You lose this?
How's he doing?
Jesus Christ.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Time!
What?
Clair is a hovering mother.
