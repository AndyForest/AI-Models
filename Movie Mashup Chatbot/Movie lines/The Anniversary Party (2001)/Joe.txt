Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
October-ish.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Leo?
What?
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
Who, Sally?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
No, what?
With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
She's a constant surprise.
Isn't Skye amazing?
And how's the diva doing?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
It has your ring.
Had a little help?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
Leave us alone right now.
Fuck you.
Stupid tart.
But she's alright.
And?
The suspense is killing me.
What is it?
So?
Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
You really need to be fucked.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
When does he graduate high school?
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Please?
Can I open it?
That for us?
Anymore.
Fuck you.
Will you make love with me?
Oh, Sally Mae...
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
I know.
Happy anniversary.
That's under lock and key.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
No.
I don't want to go tonight.
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
I have no idea who you are.
I'll never forgive you.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
You're not ready.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
You changed your mind.
Don't do this!
Don't do this.
Don't push me away.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
It's a novel.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
That is not true.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
Love?
Otis!
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Otis!!!!
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
He'll find his way back.
Well he can't have gone far.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Dolphins.  Great.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
Truce.
Okay, knock it off.
It's an unfair advantage.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
Two minutes.
It's taken care of.
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
Otis!  No barking!
You can never be too early or too thin.
I'll say as little as possible.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
You want me to uninvite her?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
What?
Don't get it.
For good.
We're great.
No.  I missed that.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
Not.
Kiss the back of my knees.
What did you get me?
Accept a compliment.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Happy anniversary.
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
Sure.
Come on, Panes...
Has she called?
Panes!  How are you?
It's Jerry's worst idea.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Mmm hmmm.
Ah.
And I you.
Do I put you off?
Joking.
Not long.
Don't I find what?
Yes I did.
No.
Yes.
It's a novel.
Yes, she is.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
Oh.  You're serious.
I meant Sally.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Ah there's our snookums now.
It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Sorry?
I like you.
Come here.
You must have been a baby.
How long have you been married?
And he doesn't smoke?
A lot of cakes.
That's a lot of those.
I'm sorry.
I think he's really angry with me too.
Lemon it is.
Lemon or raspberry?
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
Let's go for a walk.
Are you okay?
Sally!!!!
I need to leave you now.
We're way past inappropriate.
Scout's honor.
Easy tiger.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
And you know, he really does not.
Elitism?
What?
Very well put.
Hm.
No you're not.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
How do you do, Skye?
