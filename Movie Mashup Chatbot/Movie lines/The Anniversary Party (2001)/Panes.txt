I'll do it.
Coffee?
What's a sign for that?
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Oh, you know, I am.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Would you, like, marry him?
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.
The Shostakovich.
That was my clue.
The charades.
I was impressed.
Do you need anything else?
Is there space here?
No, never.
Not at all.
Come on in.
What did I do?
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
I guess.
You don't need to thank me.
Yes, you're a monster.
You're my best friend.
So tell me, how's it going?
Um.  Happy for you.
Well, something's wrong.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Why not?
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
What does that mean?
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
I didn't hear me say tonight.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
I wasn't finished.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Like your business managers?
You see, that's worse.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
It could be worse.
You don't know she's a bitch.
She's even better looking in the flesh.
Oh great.
Not enough.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
