I think there are sixteen there.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
Very.
Are you asking me to marry you?
If he were still alive, maybe.
Yeah.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Do Peter Sellers again.
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Really??
Oh?
Thank you.
Oh?
No, no thanks.
Yes.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
I don't mind...
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
