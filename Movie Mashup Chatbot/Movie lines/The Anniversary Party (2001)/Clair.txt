Honey?
I...wait, what are you talking about?
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
It's alright, isn't it?
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
Just don't fucking tell her.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
I'll change back before we leave.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
Didn't I say?
To dander.  Otis.
He's allergic.
What?
I'm not.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Oh my God, the sitter.
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
Really?
Really.
Don't you miss it?
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
