Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
I never have any luck.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Yeah... I guess it does.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
