It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Aren't we going a little hard?
Whatever you need.
I'm good at that.
Wire pull over?
What about the vault?
Okay. How many bank exits?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Yeah. I got out.
Chicago.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
I Just want to find a suitcase.
Can he trust you?
How long have you been married?
That right?
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
I'll tell you when.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I got a nurse in mind.
What's the damage?
