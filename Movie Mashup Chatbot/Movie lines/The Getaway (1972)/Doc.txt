Get it over with...
I bet.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
No applause!
I'm in a hurry.
No way. I always do my own work.
That's your problem.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
That's right.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
Beynon.
I'll take care of my end.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
What about them?
I get my own help.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
All it takes is a long arm.
You gotta be kidding.
We walk.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Pull over.
Yeah.
I don't know, airport I guess.
You okay?
Just get your clothes on...
Come on, come on.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Whatever you say.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
You and me.
I don't see how.
You want to try with me?
Whatever happens it's over.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
I guess you're right.
We got this far.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
I want to say something.
We're going to make it.
We better stick here till tonight.
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
No scars.
Okay?
Are you hungry?
How much?
Where are you going?
Let's do it.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
You can't trust anything these days.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
When are you going to learn?
El Paso.
I think you liked it with him.
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
I didn't mean police.
There may be a hunting party.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
When they find it, they find it.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
I mean it.
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
I'll bet you can.
Texas is a big state.
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
There better be a guy with the
Sure?
How long ago.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
And switched keys.
We keep going.
If you don't start telling the truth...
Who's she?
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me?
Do it my way.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Do it my way.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Why?
They checked in.
I see it...
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
Bullshit.
At least you were outside.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
That bad?
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
My mind's not on guessing games.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
I didn't. I just waited.
That doesn't hurt.
Why are you laughing?
Yeah... I know.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
Is he straight?
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
You were asleep.
Better than I remembered.
Really?
I'll be okay.
Wait... give me a minute.
It's just been a while.
I guess I'm kind of...
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
You go out much?
That's not all of it.
Boring.
How's Estelle?
You been okay?
Just the way I remembered.
Whisky and a peach.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Good.
Where did you get them developed?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Just like old times?
Where did you get those?
What's Beynon got set up?
I've been there every day for the last four years.
It doesn't look like that.
I want to take a walk.
Yeah.
It looks fine.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Hi.
No way. I've got to get out now.
Might try that.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Dillinger got killed.
What do you have in mind?
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollieï¿½s. Okay. Any questions?
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
Two.
Suit yourself.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
What about you?
You were with him?
Where?
Then you do it.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Right.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
How's Mama and the kids?
Go with God.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
You got it.
That's what I want.
Sure am.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
Come on. How much?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
Not now.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Let's just get to the border.
I kinda doubt it.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Just fine.
Drive.
