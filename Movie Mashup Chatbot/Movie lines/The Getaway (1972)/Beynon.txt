Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
What do you add up to here?
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
What about your wife?
And you got him...
News said two persons killed.
Hello, McCoy.
Stay clean.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
