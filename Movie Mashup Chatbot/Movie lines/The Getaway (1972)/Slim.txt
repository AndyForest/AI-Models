One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
Hope you get to where you're going.
That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
How about twenty thousand?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
And I keep my mouth shut?
You serious?
'Bout five thousand.
What's it to you?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Which way?
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Why not?
Where we go in1?
How was that?
Suit yourself.
