What now?
I guess we are.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Are we going to make it?
How long before this car's hot?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Where do we go from here?
Who was it?
You're crazy.
So what?
What is it?
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
What's wrong?
I'll be ready.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
Can we make it?
Okay.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Sounds good.
No more about Beynon.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
I don't want to hear it.
Sure...
Yeah.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
No scars?
I think so... I don't know.
Not now.
Twenty eight hundred.
El Paso.
Only one car.
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
I did I killed a man.
That would be the first time.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
You're full of ifs.
What?
Why, there's nothing on the news?
Like what?
You've got it all figured.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
Do you mean that?
What do you want to do?
When we had trouble before it was different.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
I can handle it.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
You bastard...
Fifteen minutes.
He must have.
A man helped me open it...
What do we do?
She's on TV.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
You sent me to him.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
I don't want to go there.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Do you trust him?
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
He might be ready to chop us up.
There are three men dead.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
Doc...
What about the bank?
... and live happily ever after.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
I mean it.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
Promise you won't laugh.
You know how I feel?
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
For exits off Main Street.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Want to cry now?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
I couldn't have... much longer.
You got the parole, didn't you?
$250,000 right off the top.
Suit yourself.
I bought you a lot of new things.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
How was it?
Really.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
Sure.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
It's all right.
I'm still here, Doc.
After four years and now the question comes up.
No. It's been a long time.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
Fatter... some things never change.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
How does it taste?
What do you want for dinner?
Half a million.
Assumed name... Houston.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Better than old times.
I've been doing my homework.
Small town, small bank, big money.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Where do you want to go?
Feel good?
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Sure...
You want to drive?
You okay?
Hello, Doc.
We'll try again.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
No, I'm afraid not.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
No, I'm not.
Where's home?
That's right.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Oh my God.
