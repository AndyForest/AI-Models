Yes, ma'am.
Yeah, I know.
Just wanted to see.
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
Now wait...
That's not right, really, cuz I...
I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
Sure.
Yeah.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
Don't... don't say that to me...
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
Or what? OR WHAT?
YOU SHUT UP!
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Yeah, I do.
I'm a what?
What?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
Yeah?
Yeah, I know.
You feelin' sick?
Hey.
Rae!
Rae don't do this now...
Rae...
