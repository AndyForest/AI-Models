Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
The hell are you talkin' about?
All that shit's on aisle 5.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
You need money again?
Yeah.
What happened to your face?
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
