Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
Like I told you.
Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Go ask him.
He tapped that.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.

Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
Shit. Who hasn't?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
You need some weed?
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Thought you had a man for that.
