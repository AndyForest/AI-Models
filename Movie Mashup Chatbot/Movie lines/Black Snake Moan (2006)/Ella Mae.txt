Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Well, that makes it easier.
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
