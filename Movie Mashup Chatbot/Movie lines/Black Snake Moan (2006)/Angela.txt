Then start taking them seriously.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
What are you doing?
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
More cough syrup?
What do you need?
Hey.
When? Now? Oh. No.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
I bet you have loyal customers.
This was very sweet of you.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
You didn't have to do this.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Not if no one finds out.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Is your niece older than 12?
You take her to a doctor?
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
Yes?
Well. It's good to see you.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Lazarus?
