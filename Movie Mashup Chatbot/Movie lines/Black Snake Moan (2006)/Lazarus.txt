I do. God's truth. I do.
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Can I come in?
I need ya help again.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
At church?
That'd be nice.
You liked what I brung ya?
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
Don't make it less true.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
This gonna get you in trouble?
Oh, she older than that.
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
I need to uh...
Angela?
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
You hurt it?
Oh! Gave me a start.
I'll take a jar of that, too.
For your hands?
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
God forgive you, for how you done me...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Rose... please...
Better'n me?
Kept us warm for twelve years.
I keep the heat on.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
And you gonna live it with him?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Like a man.
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
You sayin' you'll do what?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Maybe I won't.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
Get a good picture in your mind.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
I know that.
How you feelin' today?
Looks like you know a song.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Don't think that'd be wise.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
You can handle it.
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
What is it?
I tried.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Tell me what to do.
I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Anything.
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
No joke.
To freedom.
Want another?
You take it straight?
You drink whiskey?
Well, get to it.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
I said... STOP!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
Whose doin' is that?
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
In my house, you watch that lip...
No ma'am.
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
How you let men treat ya like they do?
Gal, you ain't right yet.
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
Let me say somethin' first...
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Don't need none.
Well I don't...
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Come on, gal...
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
How a girl get like that?
Nuh-uh.
Naw!
Uh-huh.
What'chu sayin'?
What'chu sayin'?
What'chu sayin'?
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
Now, hold up.
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Why you say that?
This Rae... you get with her?
Huh?
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Word wit'cha. In private.
I do.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
The hell is this shit?
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
Not like that.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Ask the chef.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I told you to TURN BACK!
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
I didn't start this, R.L.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
So...  That your first time?
My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
Keep the change on that.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
