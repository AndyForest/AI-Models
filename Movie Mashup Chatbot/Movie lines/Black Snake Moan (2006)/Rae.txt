Okay.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Hi.
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
I got others.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
You go to hell.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Yeah.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
I don't want you to let go.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
What I love.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
Sorry.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I guess you have.
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
By myself?
Nothin'.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
Where you gonna be?
You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
The... chain helps.
I'm here with you.
Could you do somethin' for me?
I ain't in a hurry.
Still makin' jokes?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Sure.
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
I can handle that.
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
I don't fuckin' cook.
Uh-uh.
Let go of me...
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Uh-uh.
Itches.
Uh-uh.
If I break one you gonna shoot me?
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
I CAN'T!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Or what?
LET ME GO!
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
You some kind'a pervert?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
What do you want?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
What?
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Why you got me chained?
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Wait. He left.
Where's Ronnie?
Two days?
How long... how long I been out?
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Teh... Tehronne?
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You a preacher?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
Thank you.
Ronnie...
Ronnie. Please, baby...
I feel better. Do you?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Holy shit!
Are you wasted?
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
Hey.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
This ain't gonna work.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
I just wanted some make-up.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
Got in a little accident.
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
The hell you call me?
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
You got any money?
