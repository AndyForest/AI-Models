Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
LAZ, I said let...!
Let go of my arm...
Let go...
I don't love ya no more.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Better than what you give.
I deserve better than this.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
