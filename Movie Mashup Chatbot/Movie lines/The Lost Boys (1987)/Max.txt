It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Something the matter?
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
Not impressed, are you?
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
Say hello to Thorn.
-- a job.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
