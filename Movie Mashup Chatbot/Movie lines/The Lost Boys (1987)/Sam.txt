What's Plan B?
Well... we blew Plan A.
You gotta drive!
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
Fine!  Stay here!
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
He's my brother.
Yeah.
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
All day.
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
I don't like horror comics.
You better get some fresh air.
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
I don't like horror comics.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
What happens in tow and a half hours?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
There's a cop behind us.
Oh, no...
I thought they'd be in coffins.
What's that smell!?
Chill out Edgar.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Hit the lights again.
How do you know they're not?
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
I can't do that!
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I thought we were goin' into town.
Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Good!
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Thanks, Grandpa...
You have a T.V.?
Mom!
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
No, I'm not...
But, Mom...
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Must be a circuit breaker.
C'mere, Nanook.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
He's already gone to bed.
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
Can we get a T.V.?
He met a girl.
Help me, Mom.  Help.
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
I thought we were poor.
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
Smells like something died.
What's that smell?
What?!  Did you know that!?
But you passed the test!
I am?
Does it burn?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
What's the matter?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
The Marines.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
What about Mom?
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What happened, Michael!?
Michael?
You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
I'm making you a sandwich.
No.  On the phone.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
Did you spill something?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Do I have to do this?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Where are we going?
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
I was here first.
Even poor people have T.V.s
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
