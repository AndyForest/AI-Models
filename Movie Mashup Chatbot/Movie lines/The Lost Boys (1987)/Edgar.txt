The baddest!
We are awesome monster-bashers!
Death to all vampires!
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
<u>Four</u> to go.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
That's just the way we like it.
They're looking at us.
They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
Shut up!
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
El Vampiro.
The Prince of Darkness.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
All together?
As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
What?
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
He's not glowing.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
Or a vampire.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Okay, okay.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
