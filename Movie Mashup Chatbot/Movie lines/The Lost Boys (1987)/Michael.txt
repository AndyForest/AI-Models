What is this, David?
Where's Star, David?!
Where is she?!
What's going' on?
I'm my own man.
Don't!  Stop!
What?...
We were gonna grab some food.
I can't beat a Triumph.
Star?...
That's right.
We still going?
Sam, don't --
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
I'll take you there.
David.
Of course not!
Get out, Mom!  Run!
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Gotta go, Mom.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
Mom... please.
I'm tired now.
We are...
Sure.
Okay.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
No.  I'm up.
I'll pass.
See you later.
I'll hitch.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
He's not breathing, Mom.
He looks dead.
For what.
It's gone.  I feel it!
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
Huh?
You've got to put this on.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
I know, I've felt it...
Then it's not too late for us...
Why not?
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Okay.
When?
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
Let's go see them.
Now you and David...
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
Ouch.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
I'm Michael.
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
What's your name?
Hi...
I just wanted to... I, uh...
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Well, I...
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
Huh?...
Who are you calling?
Star.
I don't know.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
What??
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
Nanook...
Don't turn on the light.
Piss off.
Don't bother.
Mom's home?...
No.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
No.  Why?
What would that make Mom?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
Entertain yourself.
Go away.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Nowhere.
You're beautiful.
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
This room is mine.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Will you give Mom a break?
This is kind of a cool place.
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
