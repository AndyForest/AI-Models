You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Hey, take it easy.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
Why?  They're only noodles.
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Honda 250, huh?
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
You can't kill me, Star.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
No.  Stick around.
With him?
Where you going?
