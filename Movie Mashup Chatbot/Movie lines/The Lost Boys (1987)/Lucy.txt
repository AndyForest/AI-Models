'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
Michael!...
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Okay?
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Michael, are you still in bed?
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Oh, no, you won't.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
He's just a deep sleeper.
For everything.
Still mad at me?
What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
Ohmygod...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Not funny, Sam!
What did you say?
Oh, no.  Now what?
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
In here?
Where's Michael?
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Lights out, Sam.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Soon.
You've heard this story before?
Not that poor.
Tell them to get something to eat.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Ocean air!
We're getting close...
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
Max... what are you talking about?
I thought you said they needed discipline?
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I hope so.
He doesn't walk all over me.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
I'm really sorry, Max.
Max!  What's wrong?
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
You're cute, Max.
Hi, Thorn.
Do I look that needy?
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Lucy.
