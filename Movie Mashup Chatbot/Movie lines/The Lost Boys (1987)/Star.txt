I will, David!
Look.
Leave him alone.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Yeah.
For a ride.
I like Michael.
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
You didn't tell David?
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
Who, Laddie?
This is Michael.
So do I!
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Save Laddie first.
Take laddie.
David's looking for me... I have to go.
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Because I love you...
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
No... no, everything's different now...
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Okay.
I guess you're new around here.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Me, too.
What do you mean?
Star.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Okay.  Talk.
Did you want to talk to me?
Are you following me?
