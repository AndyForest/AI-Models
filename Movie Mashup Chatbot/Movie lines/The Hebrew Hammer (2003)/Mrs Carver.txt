Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
So. Do you have a name?
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Mazel Tov!
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Do what you must.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
