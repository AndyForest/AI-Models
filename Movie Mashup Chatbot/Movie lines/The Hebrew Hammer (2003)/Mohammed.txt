Hammer, you alright?
What are you doing?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
How do we bypass it?
A stereo type alarm system?
What are you doing?
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
Cool. What's it do?
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
What's wrong with him?
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
