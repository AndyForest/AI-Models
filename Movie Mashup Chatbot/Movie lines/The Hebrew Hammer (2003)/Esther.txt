Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
What do you want me to do?
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
It's Esther.
You two know each other?
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
I forgive you.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
We do!
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Keep going.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Mordechai?
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Oh!
What!?
I said, do you come here often!?
Sure. Why not.
So, now what?
Yeah, no kidding.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Any sign of Santa?
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
