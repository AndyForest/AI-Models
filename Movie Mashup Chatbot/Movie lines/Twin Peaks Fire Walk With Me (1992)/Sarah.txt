Good night, sweetheart.
It's a school night... back by nine.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Sure you do, it's good for you.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Laura.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Leland...
Leland, what are you doing?
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Oh, Leland.
