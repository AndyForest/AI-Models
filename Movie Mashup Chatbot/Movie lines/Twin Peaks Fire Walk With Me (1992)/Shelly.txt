Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
As if I didn't know.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Norma, are you alright?
You're right. There's no one here.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
