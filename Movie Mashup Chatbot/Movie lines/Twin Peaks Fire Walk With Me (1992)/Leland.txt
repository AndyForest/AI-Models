They were looking for wood.
Trees?
Sex?
Eating?
Hiking?
Boating?
I always thought you knew it was me.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
We're late to get to your mother.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
A special friend?
Who was that?
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
Let me see.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
School?
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Bobby didn't give you this?
Did you get this from your lover?
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
Look at this finger here.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Nothing, I chickened out.
That's right.
Who am I?
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
