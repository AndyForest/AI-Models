I'm so sorry, Laura.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
No... No...
What does Bob say?
Maybe.
But Bob isn't real.
Who would do that?
