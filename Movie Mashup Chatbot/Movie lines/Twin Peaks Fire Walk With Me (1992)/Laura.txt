No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
No.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
NO! GOD, NO...
Go away. I am not talking to you.
No... No, go away.
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Bobby...
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
What was?
You killed Mike.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Here he comes.
Don't be late.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
I'm nearly out.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Get lost Bobby.
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
Cause I like it.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
I can't help you there.
WE got it back, that's all.
What can I tell you?
No.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
No, you should forget about last night.
Not you, Donna, not you.
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Nothing.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
No, you're the muffin.
Donna, you are a muffin.
If I can smoke it.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
No, I want to smoke.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Donna, are you my best friend?
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Well, why not?
Maybe.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
I don't know what to do.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
He probably wanted to drive over.
When?
Thanks.
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
Noooo...
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
Oh, yes... yes...
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Bob.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
I already made you two tapes.
I'm not.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Let's go all the way.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
What? She asked about my father?
I am The Muffin.
Hey, Jacques...
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
You want to see...
Bobby killed a guy.
When he finds out.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
You mean the ones you pity.
"Oh, Laura..."
Everything, but everything.
You know it and I know it.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
I can't tonight.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
Not now.
James...
How can I be together if I'm not together?
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
Okay.
James...
Good night, Mom.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Where's Dad?
I hate asparagus.
Mom, take it easy.
Mom... what are you wearing?
I'm sorry, Mom.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
What were you doing in my room?
What?
I forgot my books at school.
Can I take the car?
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Stay away from me.
I was down the street.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Dad?
Are you sure you're okay?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
No.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
A friend from school.
Dad...
Not really.
...school's fine...
Fine.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
Dad.
