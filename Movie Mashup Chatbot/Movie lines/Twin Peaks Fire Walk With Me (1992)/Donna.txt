Why do you do it, Laura?
But I love you, Laura.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
How did the car get back here?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
You're not mad at me?
Laura, I am your friend.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
What are you doing?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
Dancing.
Where are the Cookies?
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
Where are you going?
Goodbye, Muffin.
You want a muffin?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Do you want to talk?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
Of course...
Laura?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Call me.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
Oh god, Laura.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Are you going to see James tonight?
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
The usual, 9:15.
James called me last night looking for you.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
You didn't do your homework?
