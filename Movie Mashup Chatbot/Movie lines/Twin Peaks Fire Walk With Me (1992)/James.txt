See what?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
What?
What?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
You always hurt the ones you love.
Oh, Laura.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
What do you mean?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What's going on?
What about tonight?
This afternoon?
I've got to see you.
When am I going to see you?
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
We were supposed to be together.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
It does matter. We're in love.
Why? It does.
Laura, do you love me?
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
