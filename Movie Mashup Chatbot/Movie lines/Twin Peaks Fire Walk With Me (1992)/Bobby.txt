Bobby's got it.
We can do it right here.
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
Let's ditch this place and party.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Don't get funny with me again.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
The stuff we got last night.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Here he comes.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
