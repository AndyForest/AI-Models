All right.
Gold. You were going to�
Say, what about that gold deal?
It's unbelievable.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Chalmers Bryant!
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Well, that's that, I guess.
Charming chap.
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Suppose she should leave it?
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Yes, charming.
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
I surprise you? Now that's news.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Very often.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
108 and still active?
Well, is it?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
He amputated his own leg?
When was all this?
Who?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
�buy and sell?
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Well, it must have taken�
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
You have no disputes over women?
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
That's intelligent.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
Who, for instance?
So there are others?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
And the wine - excellent.
Thank you.
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction�
And mine's Conway.
Hey!
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
You're lying, aren't you?
Yes.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Father Perrault is dead.
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago�  �you're still alive, Father Perrault!
It's astonishing - and incredible, but�
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as�
Are you the High Lama?
Do you think this will come in my time?
Mine?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
What was that?
Come on! We're wasting time!
What about the others?
The clothes?
You say the porters are waiting for us?
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
You're wrong, George.
She came here in 1888!
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
You can't take her away from here!
What's she got to do with it?
Maria?
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Oh, George . . .
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Is that all my story meant to you?
I don't need any proof.
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
So you think I'm mad?
I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
You can't leave, George.
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Why - I'm sorry - but I�
Porters?
All right. Sorry, George.
George, come back!
George, what do you think you're doing?
Shhh!
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Porters?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
Uh-huh.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Well - I mean�
Did I say "if"?
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
I don't know.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
See that spot?
He's dead.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
Oh George, come on.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
George, what are you going to do?
Oh, stop it!
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants�  �and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
Hurray!
You?
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Come on! Quick! This way.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
Hello? Colonel?
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
We'd be eternally grateful if you�
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
What do you suggest?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
I guess we're in for it.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
What if he refuses?
That fellow got on at Baskul.
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
Where were you hiding?
Why aren't you registered through our office?
Where did you come from?
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
I'd love it!
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Ouch!
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
I wonder.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Thank you.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
A man whose life was empty!
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Was this your idea?
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
hope you'll forgive me for�
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
