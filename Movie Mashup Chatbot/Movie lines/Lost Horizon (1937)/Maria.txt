No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Are you taking me?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
Thank you.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Please don't go.
