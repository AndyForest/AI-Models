I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Why?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Why, mother?
I was just going to.
Why?
Struggling, why?
Why?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
You see, it's not a dream.
Bump?
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm so glad.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
What is?
I'm thirty.
Yes, I know.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Yes.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
That was easy. I read your books.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
My name's Sondra.
