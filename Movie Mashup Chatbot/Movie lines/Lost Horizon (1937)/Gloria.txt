If you want me to!
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Nothing. Why?
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
No.
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
What do you want?
