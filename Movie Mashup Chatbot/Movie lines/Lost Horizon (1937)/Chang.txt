Yes.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
Thank you.
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Charming, isn't she?
Shall we have another?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
The only one.
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
You're startled?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
Centuries.
They were.
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Oh, good heavens, no!
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including�  �the excess of virtue itself.
We follow many.
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
In time you will meet them all.
Oh, yes.
Goodness, no!
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
Where is your mad pilot?
How do you do?
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Please let me help you.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
Thank you.
Then it's done.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Splendid!
Now, what would you like to do?
Why, no.
Oh, I'm so glad.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Yes.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
No.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't�
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now�
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
Oh, dear.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Pardon me�
