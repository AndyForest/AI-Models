I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
