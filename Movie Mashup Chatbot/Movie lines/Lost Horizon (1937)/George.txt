All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
You mean you don't want to go?
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
Look, Bob!
Over by that hill.
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out�porters or no porters!
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
How can we get in touch with them?
As far away as I ever want to be.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
was saying�
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Yes, everything!
Yes.
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
Why not?
She's going with me.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
I'd go mad!
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned�
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
I don't see that there's anything to say.
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of�
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
What about the porters?
Let me up! Let me up!
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Let me go, Bob!
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Nothing about the porters yet?
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
That's what you said.
What do you mean if we should get out?
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
What are you talking about?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What's it mean?
Yes.
What is it?
Dead?
What is it? Has he fainted?
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
What are these people?
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Yes.
Yes, Bob.
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
Just what I needed too.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Bob, these are all that are left.
Right, Bob.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Yes.
Yes.
Bob! I think I hear motors!
You'll wait till you rot!
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
How about you? Do you want to go?
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Why, he's speaking English.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
What do you want him to do?
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
All right, I'll be there.
Perhaps.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
EXCUSE ME�
