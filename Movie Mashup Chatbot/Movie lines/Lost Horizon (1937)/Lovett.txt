Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
They were in a quandary, and�
�then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
Horns? What kind of horns?
Horns?
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Yes.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people�
The police?
Certainly not.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Yes.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
I'm thinking.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Please don't call me Lovey.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Do you think they're cannibals?
Where are they? Do you see them?
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
Now you're irritating and absurd!
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is�  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Oh, really?
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south�
It certainly is.
That's ridiculous.
Why, of course. Yes.
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
I see.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Good morning�
I beg your pardon.
Don't call me brother.
Yes, it just shows�  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Not at all.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Found in Asia!
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
A paleontologist.
I'm a paleontologist.
Fossils.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Oh, immediately.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"�  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
No porters here!!
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
Where are we going? Huh?
Why, you - you� Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
In for what?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
Good.
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly�
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Yes.  Barney!
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Go? Where?
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
English!
What is it?
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
It's Fenner.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
