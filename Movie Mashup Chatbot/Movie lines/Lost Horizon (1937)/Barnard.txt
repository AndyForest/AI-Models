Two years!?
What about those men we met this morning?
Not even a radio?
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village�
In a quandary.
Come on, Lovey.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
There you are!
Certainly not!
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
Yeah. You know.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Okay, Lovey.
Just call me Barney.
Sounds like a stall to me.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Have I?
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots.
No kidding?
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
Will you stop squawking!
Yes!
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
He might have lost his way.
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Yes.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Look here�
Is it?
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
I see.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Good morning, Lovey.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
Okay, brother.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Uh-huh.
Sorry.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Uh-huh.
Well, what do you know about that!
Oh, I see.
A what?
Fossils, huh?
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Huh?
Think of it! In times like these.
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
I'll say.
What are we going to do?
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Why, you look beautiful.
Hey, what's happened to you?
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business�
Well - I'm�
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
When are you going to start?
Leaving?
Hey - look!
Cave, eh? Where?
