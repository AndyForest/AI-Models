Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Ann--
Ann--
...Yes?
Yes?
Yes, Ann?
Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Ann. Will you come in?
...No, please.
Birdy--
...I guess I've been all wet.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Huh.
Ah... it's nothing.
...Uh-huh.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
He didn't say that.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
Yeah.
Hello, Birdy.
Hello, Tony.
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Who?
Yeah. Thanks.
Hello, Rachel.
...You don't like the music out there?
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Did she make mistakes?
I don't understand.
Well? How'd she do?
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Uh-huh.
No. Uh... family friend.
OK.
All right.
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
Look, uh... Creighton...
Uh-huh.
That'll be fine.
It's OK.
Yeah.
Sure.
Cash.
Yeah.
Way out of line.
You're out of line, mister.
...Was that a pass?
Ed.
I'll have it in a week.
And how do we share--
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
No. I--tell me--
I can get it, yeah.
No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Huh.
That right.
Uh--
I, uh...
Big Dave--
...Huh?
So you paid the guy?
...Dave?
OK.
Your place?
But it's...
Mm.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
...You know... who *who* is?
How much to they want, Dave?
Uh-huh.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
What is it, Dave?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
All right, I guess.
How's business, Dave?
Mm.
No, Dave, I wasn't.
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Told what?
Just coffee.
...Doris--
Honey...
You don't have to tell me anything.
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
You don't have to--
What happened to you?
How are you?
Honey...
Congratulations, Gina.
I didn't say a word.
Mm.
So?
How's that?
Who?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Yeah, right.
Where you going?
Mm.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
So... who... who actually--
Yeah.
...I don't get it.
...I don't think so.
I took Doris's keys.
I don't know. I don't think so.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
He and Doris... were having an affair.
*I* was with her.
It was Big Dave's.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
...OK.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Yeah.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
...So, uh, who should I--
I'm fine. Thanks.
So, who should I--
So--
He a good man?
Yeah. What do I, uh...
I'm fine.
No thanks.
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I don't work here. My wife does.
...Huh?
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
That was quite something.
...Did you make that up?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's very generous.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
Yeah.
...Nah.
OK.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
...You ever wonder about it?
This hair.
Frank.
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Yeah.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Birdy...
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
I don't understand.
My *wife*?
Huh?
...We goin'?
Doesn't bother me.
Hello.
Yeah?
...I'm Crane.
No thanks, I--
Yeah--
Crane. Ed Crane.
Hello, Walter.
