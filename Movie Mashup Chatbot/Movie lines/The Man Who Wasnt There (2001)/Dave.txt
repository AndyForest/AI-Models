I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
What kind of man *are* you?
...What kind of man *are* you?
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
Come on in.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
Please, Ed.
Please, Ed.
Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
...Oh, Jesus.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
...Ed, I...
Uh-huh.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
She's a rare one.
...That's quite a wife you got there.
...Were you in the service, Ed?
How ya doin', Ed?
