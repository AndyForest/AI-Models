Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
It's OK...
...I wanted to make you happy.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
You're an enthusiast.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
But more or less.
...I stank, didn't I?
Geez, Mr Crane.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
Oh, Mr Crane--
Boy.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
We've certainly missed you.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
