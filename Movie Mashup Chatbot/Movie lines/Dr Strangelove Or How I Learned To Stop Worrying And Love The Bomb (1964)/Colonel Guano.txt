That's government property, Major.
So what?
What about the President?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
