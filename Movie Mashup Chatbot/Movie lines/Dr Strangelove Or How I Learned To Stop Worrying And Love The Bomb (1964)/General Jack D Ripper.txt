And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Who do you think you're talking to?
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Why do you think I ask?
Do you recognize my voice?
This is General Ripper speaking.
