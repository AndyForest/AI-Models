Yes, sir.
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
