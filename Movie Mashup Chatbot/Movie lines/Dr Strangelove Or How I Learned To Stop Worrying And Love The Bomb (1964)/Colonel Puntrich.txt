Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
What did you say?
What is your name, young lady?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
No, sir.
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
What did you say, sir?
General Schmuck?
