I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Why? Hi, Karl.
They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
