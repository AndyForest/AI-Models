I'll be back in a little bit then.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Would y'all like that?
It went real good.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
What do you want, hun?
Leave.
Leave.
Leave.
Leave.
That might be better than this.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
Please Doyle, don't.
What?
He does make some funny noises.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Huh?
I know he does.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
I'm glad of it, honey.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
We sure like havin' you.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Yeah.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
Well, okay. I got you some.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
I believe you. I really do.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Okay.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Right now?
I'll be dog.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
You scared me.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
I know.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
