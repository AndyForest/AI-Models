Why won't he talk to women?
No, we have to get this story.
Do you smell shit?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Will he be supervised?
Where will he go?
I didn't mean that.
Is he leaving right this minute?
Signs?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Before they were married?
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
No thank you.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Yes sir.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
