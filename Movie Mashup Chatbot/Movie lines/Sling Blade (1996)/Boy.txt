My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Okay. You don't have to though.
About a half a mile I think it is.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
Yeah.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Yeah.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Well, I guess it's all good.
Did you decide, sir?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Well, what did you want?
Can I help you?
