Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
It is apparently not working.
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Excuse me, Andy...
We are all impressed.
Goals are important.
Are you at peace with your family?
