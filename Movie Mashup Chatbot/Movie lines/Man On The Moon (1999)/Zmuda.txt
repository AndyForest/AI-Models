And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
It's working for Elvis.
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
What is this, World War Two...?
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
No!  Andy, don't do it --
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
What?!?
Hey Andy, good show.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
I used to think you were original.
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Don't believe everything you hear.
That was a really hot house!
