I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
"Burlesque"?
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
What's your name?
