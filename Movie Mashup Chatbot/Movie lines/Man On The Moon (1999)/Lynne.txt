You're NOT DYING!
How can you be so casual??!
Have you told your family?
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
Andy... there is no real you.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
It's me.
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
And all this will be for real?
Why Memphis?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
I'm here, ain't I?
You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, the theater's that way!
No thanks.
Hi... am I late?

Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
