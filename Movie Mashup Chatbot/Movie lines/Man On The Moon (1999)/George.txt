Really?
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
Yeah...
You've got good days and bad days.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
So how can I help you...?
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
You must take a little pleasure in it.
What was that all about?
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
There'll be other shots.
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
Andy!
That's alright.  Where...?
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Andy?
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
You have to do it.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
People love... comedians.
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Can I help you with something?
Er, yes.  Speaking.
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
So your name's not Gorsky.
