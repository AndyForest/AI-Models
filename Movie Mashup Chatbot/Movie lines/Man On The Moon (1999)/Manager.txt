Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
