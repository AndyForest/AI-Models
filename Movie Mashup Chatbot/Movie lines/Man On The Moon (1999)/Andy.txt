Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
My hair is coming out.
I can't move my arm.
Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
Tony Clifton.
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
We were just trying to push the envelope --
What, you don't think I can beat him?
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
They're having a laugh...
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
But wasn't it funny?
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
How long would they let me sleep?
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
I'm sorry, George...
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
What's up?
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Hi George!
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Those are my terms.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
I refuse.
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
No.
George, I hate sitcoms.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Sitcom...?
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
No.  Caspiar.
Tank you veddy much.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
B-but I have them.
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
Oh!
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Right...
Deal.
Twenty!
But it's only for thirty seconds!
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
What do you mean?
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
You don't know the real me.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Oh, it's open.
Go away.
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
I can shtop whenever I want...
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
If you want...
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
Yes.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Popcorn?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Hi...
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Hi...
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
DON'T TOUCH ME!
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
You're not listening to me --
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
And you're just poor white trash!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
And you're just poor white trash!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
I was very original!
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Sir, do you have a problem?
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
It's so dirty.
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
They're asking for it.
Give me the book.
So?  What do they know?
Each show is worse than the next.
I'm gonna quit.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
"Philosophically"?
Why??  I... I attend every year.
Yes, your Holiness?
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Are you sure?
