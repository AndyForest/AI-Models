B-but... we saw... your neck...
B-but... we saw... your neck...
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
Andy!
Why isn't he MOVING??
They're gonna lynch him!
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
He said he's coming back!
Where?
Is he in his room?
