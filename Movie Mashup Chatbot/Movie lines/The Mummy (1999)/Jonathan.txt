Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Excuse me?
Oh yes, of course.
And how does one do that?
And what ritual would that be?
You're not going to kill us?
Yes,... I see.
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Oh.
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
I found it, Evy! I found it
Juicy?
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Did you ever see him eat?
Still...
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Way to go, Evy.
Picked his pocket, actually.
That just makes you more gullible.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
I was mistaken.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
Yes?
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
You have got to be joking?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
What?
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
That looked rather painful.
Who's here!?
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
You did not!?... We're not!?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
That thing gives me the creeps.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
Um, well, you see...
She's my sister, actually.
