Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
You shall see.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
What friend? You're my only friend.
Do you know where I can steal some?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Even?
You always did have more balls than brains.
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
My very good friend! What a surprise.
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
In the desert? What for?
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Yeah! Them.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
Yeah?
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
