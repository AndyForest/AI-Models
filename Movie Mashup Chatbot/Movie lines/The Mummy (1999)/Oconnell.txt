Well, okay then.
I never killed a priest before.
Who the hell are these guys?
You know where he's taking her?
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Relax, I got him.
What does he want the book for?
What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
Immune from what?
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
Where's your new friend?
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
C'mon, friend.
Goin' somewhere?
I've had worse.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Sounds familiar.
Let's make us even, shall we?
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
None of the above, thank you.
Altar boys?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
Now go find me a big stick.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
Try me.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
Got guts, lady.
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Got what?
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
FINE.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
That bad huh?
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
Is he supposed to look like that?
You dream about dead guys?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Because that's my name.
Not unless you call me Rick.
No you're not.
And what is that?
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
Something like that.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
Who was talking about what?
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Preparation for what?
What are those mirrors for?
The things that get you excited.
We're about to be shown the way.
We're almost there.
Trust me.
Can you swim?
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
I know my treasure.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Really want to know?
Want to know?
I found sand. I saw death.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Every damn day.
Yeah, I was there.
I just decked your brother
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
No.
So who's the broad?
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
Got it.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
We gotta get her back.
What?
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
Where's my gun?
Tough break.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
And you're sure you can find the secret compartment?
None taken.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
Awfully.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Hey,... don't I know you?
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
