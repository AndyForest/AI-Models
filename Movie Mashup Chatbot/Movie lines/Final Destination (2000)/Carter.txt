"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
You're the fuckin' devil.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
We're losing our favorite teacher.
All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
I'll remove him.
It broke!
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
SHUT UP, BILLY!
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
That's what I'm doin'!
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
You have a responsibility to tell me.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
Terry's name should be on this wall.
