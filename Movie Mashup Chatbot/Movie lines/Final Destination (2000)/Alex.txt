When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
You know what to do.
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Let us out!
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Most kids do, I guess.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
Right. April 25th.
Remember the departure time?
Thirty-nine.
Remember the gate number?
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
That's him, but... he's not here.
That... him?
This place?!
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
I'm... really sorry.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
It's only the end of June.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
No!
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
Why do you think I was hiding?
Look, there's something you should all know.
I don't.
I wish you were on the plane!
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
That's a plan.
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
No. I saw it. I saw it!
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
I'm sorry we broke in.
Design?
You saying Tod did kill himself?
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
