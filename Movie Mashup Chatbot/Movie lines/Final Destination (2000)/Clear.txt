No! No! Don't!
Police are coming.
Get out! Get out of the car!
Carter, get out!
Can't you open the door?!
Stop the car!
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
Nothing is... anymore.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Most kids never have it happen.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
4:25.
Like... 4:25.
No.
Thirty-nine.
As in flannels and plaids?
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Then, let's go see him!
Is that something you're "feeling?"
"It?"
That's why I was there last night.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
He's not a witch.
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Get control of yourself!
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
Knock it off!
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
What are you doing?
