No harm. No foul.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
In Death...
Cuticle lacerations.
I know who you are.
