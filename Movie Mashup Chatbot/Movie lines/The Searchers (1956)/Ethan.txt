Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
You askin' me to clear out now?
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
How should I know?
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
Huh...? No...no water.
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
Why don't you finish the job?
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
I say NO!
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
You got any more orders, Captain?
Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
By what you preach...none!
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
Got a warrant?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
You ain't goin'...
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Told ya, didn't I?
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Well, the reward still stands...
You were born old...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Ain't yours yet.
And maybe you lie...
Keep talking.
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Talk!
That's what I said.
How'd you come by this?
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
It's what I'm countin' on.
What's that got to do with us?
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
Not no more.
They'll be back...
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
How? She's even forgot her own language!
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
Stay out here.
Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Well, you're a widower now...
Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Nine...  Ten!
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
You ask her!
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
Forget it...
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
He just couldn't wait...
You all settled an' comfortable now?
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Good night.
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
That don't make 'em kin...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Why?
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Good night...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
Easy on that!
If they're still alive...
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Nothing for you to see.
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
You've done a lot of growin'...
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
Comancheros...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
Not far from it...
I've seen her...and she's alive.
She's not a little girl any more.
No...not yet...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
I got your boy killed.
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
