Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
It isn't fair...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
Finish your breakfast...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Ain't worth the mendin'...
