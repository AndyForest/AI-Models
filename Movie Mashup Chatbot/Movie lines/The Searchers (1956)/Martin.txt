It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
I've come now...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
Grab hold!...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
What's goin' on?
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
We won't be here...Come on!
Over there!
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Why didn't he make his move back there?
You figger Scar means to kill us?
Not likely.
Never heard of him...
Lemme alone...
No...She's not...
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
What's the sense in it!
Ethan, quit it!
I think maybe we oughta...
Think she means for us to follow?
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Look?
Cut it out, will ya...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
What?
Think it might be...?
But I just bought a good blanket.
Scar?
Whatchu doin'?...
Futterman?
Oh...
What's that?
Hey! What's the idea...?
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Because she's my...my...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Good night...Laurie...
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Say it. We're beat!
What you goin' to do?
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
You all right, Ethan?
You want us to fire a shot if...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Leggo...
Well, come on!
Well, fust off...
What you want me to call you?
Yes, sir.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
Only if I'm dead!
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
I got to fetch her home...
You crazy?
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
It wasn't much of a letter...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
Might at least have left me my pants!
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Well I ain't one of 'em!
Don't go takin' that stuff...
But couldn't you...?
Where?
She'd be about thirteen now...
