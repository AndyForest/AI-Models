You've seen her!...She's alive?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Why it's just a snip of calico...
Don't go blamin' yourself...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
