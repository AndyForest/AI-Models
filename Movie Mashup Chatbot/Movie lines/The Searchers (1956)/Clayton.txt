Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
You all right, sergeant?
In that case, give the boys room...
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Another one, eh?
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Now mount up, son...
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
How many, would you say?
<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
You got one now!
I didn't give any order to fire!
How far's the river from here, Mose?
Just keep goin'...
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
What good does that do?
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
He cometh forth like a...
You fit a lot of descriptions.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
What in...?
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
JOINT action?
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
I'm Clayton.
