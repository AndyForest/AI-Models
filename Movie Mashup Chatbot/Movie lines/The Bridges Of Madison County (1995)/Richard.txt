I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
Franny?
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
I'm going to miss you.
Frannie.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Where you going?
What time is it?
'Bout 4:30.
Sure.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
You feeling better Franny?
