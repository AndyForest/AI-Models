Well, I can help.
I don't mind waiting.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
I simply can not stand that tone!
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Well, that's a long time.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
No treasure maps, huh?
How bizarre!
Eeeww!
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
