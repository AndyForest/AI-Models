I said NO!
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
Why are there two deeds here?
Doesn't matter. Move on.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
Oh Jesus.
SO!
It's not that long.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Carolyn!
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Nobody did.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
Not yet. You want to go?
I bet mom could've helped her.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Bar across the street.
Then why do you?
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
No. We're going to lock this up and --
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
That's it!
Grateful!?
I can't believe she's making jokes.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
What?
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
What's he saying now?
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
What?!
Yeah.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
What problem?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
Lawyer here?
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Okay.
Betty.
Okay.
Nah.
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
WHAT!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
When did she decide this?
Cremated?!
