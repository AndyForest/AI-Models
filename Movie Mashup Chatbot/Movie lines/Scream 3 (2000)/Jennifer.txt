Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Good twist.
Bitch.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Basements creep me out.
Gale Weathers would find a way.
There a story in that building?
Need to get in that building?
That's funny.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Geez.
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Oh shit it's my cell!
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
