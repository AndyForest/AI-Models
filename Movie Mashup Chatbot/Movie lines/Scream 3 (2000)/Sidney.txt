Oh yeah, how?
How is that good news?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Hmm.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
What do you mean?
Excuse me?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Did you request this case?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
What do you know about trilogies?
Absolutely.
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
They've got her!
Where are you Dewey?
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Yeah?
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
I can see nothing's changed.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
GALE WATCHOUT!
I know!
Gale he's got Dewey!
What are you talking about?
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
I thought you wanted me here?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Yeah?
WHERE?
Where?
You're dead!
How do I know their voices are --
Yes.
Who is this?
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
W-what do you want?
Who the fuck is this?
I'm sorry, your voice.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
Are you sure?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
