Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Reaction to what?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Where are you?
Yeah.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
What?!
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
What kind of a game?
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
What do you mean?
Thanks.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
Who is this?
Jesus.  Hello?
