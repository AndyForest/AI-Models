What?  What movie?
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
Roman that's not the line.
I'm hanging up right now.
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Who's this?
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Huh, fine.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
