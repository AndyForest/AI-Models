To see your reaction.
Closer than you think.
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
Good bye Ben.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
More of a game really.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Do I?
I don't know.
Who is this?
Hello.
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Go there.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
