And what made you think it was Sidney?
No.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
The killer called her.
There's someone here who wants to help.
Detective Kincaid?
Is that a threat?
Is that a threat, Detective?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
What does this have to do with Sid?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
Where's Gale?
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
Sid I can see you!
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
No.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Follow me.
What?
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Who is it?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Do you want us to come with you?
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
GALE BEHIND YOU!
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Gale, your engine's still running.
You're not a detective.
Stop following me.
I'm on duty.
Jennifer needs me.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
Off the record.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
You used to say that was our strength.
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
What about me?
Why would the police come to you?
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
They found another note?
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
But you know who she was.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
