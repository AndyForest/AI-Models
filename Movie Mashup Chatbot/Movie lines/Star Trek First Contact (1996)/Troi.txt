I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Did you know her?
But how?
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Captain...?
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Aye, sir.

We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Even Data?
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
