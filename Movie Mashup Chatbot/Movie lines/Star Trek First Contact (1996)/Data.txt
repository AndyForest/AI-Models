I believe so.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
No.
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
No... no, please... you cannot...
Yes...
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
I... do not want this...
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
No. I will not betray my friends.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.

According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
I have helm control.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
Dispersive armor is holding.

Who are you?
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
