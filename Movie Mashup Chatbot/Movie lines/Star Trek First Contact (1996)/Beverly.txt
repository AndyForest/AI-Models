I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
You think they're still up there?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
That'll be interesting.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Are you saying they won't help us?
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
At least four hours.
