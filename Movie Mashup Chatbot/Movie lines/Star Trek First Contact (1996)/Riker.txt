No, sir.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Yes, sir.
Good luck, sir.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Captain?
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
We're still in Earth orbit.
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Emergency override!
Report!
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
I'll keep that in mind.
Right.
Just a little queasy...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Agreed. Options?
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
What are they doing?
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
What the hell is happening, Worf?
What?
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
Hold that thought.
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
I remember it made me sick.
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Where the hell are they going?
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Report.
