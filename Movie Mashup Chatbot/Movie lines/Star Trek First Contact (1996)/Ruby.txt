You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
Why?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
You're leaving, aren't you?
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
Or...?
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Friends from Cornell...
We?
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
You're lying.
'Fraid not.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Did you need something?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
