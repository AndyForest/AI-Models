We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
Absolutely.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Not yet.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
You actually performed surgery...?
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
It's Cochrane.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
Yes...
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Montana.  Energize.
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
What year is it?
Contact Starfleet Command.
Where's the Sphere?
What?
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Ready quantum torpedo.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Where?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Juice?
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
We're crossing the threshold!
Their com system must still be down.
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
One minute to warp threshold...
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
<U>Engage.</U>
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
It'll have to wait. Come on.
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
Ready to make a little history?
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
There should be some kind of manual release...
I have the password right here.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
How serious is the damage?
Let's go.
Understood. Keep me informed.
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
There is no invasion...
Invasion.
What do you want?
Something wrong with that?
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Yes.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
There's a few of us left.
California. San Francisco.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Yes.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
That's impossible.
No... I'm from France.
No. It's a lot further than that.
I have to...
I am not a thief...
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
Some.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
I'd say you already have.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
How did you know about that?
Were the two of you... involved?
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
What makes you say that?
What?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
I can try.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
I'm very sorry.
Cochrane?
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Yes, he is.
Track their weapons fire.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Life signs?
On screen.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Onscreen.
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Fire!
Go to manual.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Steady as she goes.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Fire.
Unless you'd like to stay.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
Return to our own time?
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Life signs?
On screen.
Report.
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Worf... torpedo... now!
