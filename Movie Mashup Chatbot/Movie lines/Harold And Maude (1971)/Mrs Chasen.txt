I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Eh, Poli Sci?
And what are you studying?
You are at the University, Candy?
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
How interesting.
And what do you do, my dear?
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
This is insane.
Harold!
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
A sunflower?
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
To whom?
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
