Stay where you are, Harold .
Harold, calm down! This is...
Harold!
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Harold!
Souvenirs?
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Well, I don't...
Eh?
Yes.
Oh sure.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Yes.
The moment of truth.
That's right.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
