Lady! Be quiet.
Wait here.
Where are the papers?
Then whose name is it registered in?
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Is this your shovel?
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Out!
None of that, lady.
Okay, lady. Out.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Your tree.
Took it?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Could I see your registration?
How long have you been driving?
Come again.
Yes.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
