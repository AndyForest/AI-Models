Here's your shovel.
What do you see?
A block of ice.
Sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
It's true. I can't live without you.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
But why now?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Farewell?
... which I hope will make you very happy.
For you.
It's all right. It's organic.
Supper for two.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
It looks like you. Thanks.
I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.
Why?
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
Here.
Maude.
You should have been a poet.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Do you think there is any life up there?
Look at the stars.
You sure have a way with people.
How about some candy floss?
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Oh, you weren't scared.
That wasn't very scary.
She took my head.
Just like this.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Maude, do you think you can help me?
But they'll put me in jail.
But they have.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
Maude, I must speak to you.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Where's that?
Yodeling?
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
No. I'd feel stupid.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
With God?
Maude, do you pray?
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
I like you, Maude.
Okay.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
You are the wisest person I know.
Did Confucius say that?
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Well, I really don't smoke.
I like Glaucus.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
The ice is melting.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
I don't know.
He's stopped.
I think he's following us.
Okay?
But I don't play anything.
Well, I don't...
No more revolts.
What were you fighting for?
What's that?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, I really don't drink...
Look, the ice is melting.
It is kind of rough.
What is that he's working on?
Is he all right?
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
But this is public property.
But we can't just dig it up!
But what?
What is it?
What?
What happened?
Well...
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
Because they are all the same.
I don't know. Just one of those.
What do you mean?
That's a nice teapot.
You don't look eighty.
You look as if you could.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
That's really great.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
Yes. Very much.
No.
Me! No. Of course not.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Eh, fine.
Maude???!
All right.
All right.
Sort of.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
No.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
It's very interesting.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Yearse!
But this is my car.
Yes.
Yes.
Eh, no.
What?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Nice to meet you.
Harold Chasen.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
I don't know.
Eh, no.
Eh, no. Thank you.
Perhaps it is.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
I don't care what people say.
At a funeral.
What?
To a girl. Here.
I'm getting married.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Mother.
Mother.
I have a sore throat.
No. Like this.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
No. My uncle.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Is Sunshine your real name?
Would you like a cigarette?
How do you do?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
No.  I'd have liked to.
Yes.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
No.
Well, maybe one.
No.
Huh?
I go to funerals.
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
I don't know.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
No.
And a lot of time.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Yes. It does.
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
A rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
She took my head.
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
Parasite!
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
What's the chance of getting one of these?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
How about to slit his throat?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Will they really teach me to shoot?
ZAT!
Another man's life in your sights.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
To pit your own life against another.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
You think so, sir?
Jeez! That's a great story,
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
War is not all black.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Uncle.
