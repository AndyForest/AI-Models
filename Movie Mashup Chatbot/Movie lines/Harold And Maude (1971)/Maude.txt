Because if you are...
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Check.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Officer, I can explain.
No.
We planted it.
But there is a family resemblance.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Haven't we met before?
Hello.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
No, no. I just took it.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Oh, I don't have one.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
"And this too shall pass away."
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
I feel giddy.
I thought eighty was a good round number.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Oh, Harold.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
I took them out.
Yes.
- end where I began.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Yes. They're old friends.
Well, they're my species.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Don't you advance on me.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Well, don't go.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
What is it, Harold?
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
Oh.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
From the guys who got the matches, of course.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Well, why don't you?
With Life.
Pray? No.  I communicate.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
It's so blue.
I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Of course.
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
What was that?
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
It's all right.  It's organic.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Yes.
Yes. It's almost there.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Superb.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
No.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Yes.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
We'll come back in the morning.
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
Oh, my. We're too late.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Exactly.
Why not?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Over there by the courthouse.
Look.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Why do you say that?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
What do you think?
It goes on and on.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
She seemed yare to me.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
How about some ginger pie?
Harold?
Promise?
My door is always open.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Well then.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Oh, look! The birds.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Oh.
Your hearse?
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
No.  I thought not.
Do you sing and dance?
Do you dance?
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
