Always keep 'em laughing.
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Go away, unless you got my money.
What do you want?
