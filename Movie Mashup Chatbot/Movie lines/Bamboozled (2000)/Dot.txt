He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Your father is proud of you.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
