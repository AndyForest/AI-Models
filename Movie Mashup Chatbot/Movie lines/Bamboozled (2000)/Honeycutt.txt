Louder.  They can't hear you.
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
Everybody say Ho!
