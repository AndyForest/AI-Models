I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
You can walk away.  We both can.
You're in this up till ya neck.
So that's what you been doing?
I'm out.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Look at my lips.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Please, have a seat.
What's wrong with him?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
She's also moorish.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Why are you smiling so?
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Nice to meet you.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
What kind of show is this gonna be?
How much?
Manray needs a job.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
That ain't funny.
We're starving.
We was coming to see you.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
Did we get our bill yet?
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
