I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
You know how your Daddy is.
No.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Yes he did.
He wants you to come and see him.
Peerless, your father called.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
How's the food?
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
