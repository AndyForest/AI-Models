DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
I'm tired of waiting.
And I'm the feet.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
I won't do it anymore.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Mantan?
Why?
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
To what?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
How different?
Where do I sign?
What do I have to do?
My tap shoes.
Well do something about it.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
You sing and dance?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I never had a really real pair before.
