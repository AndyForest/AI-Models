D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
It's him... it's him.
If you've lied to me to me --
Anything?
You'll do more.than that.

Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
It was me.
He's with us...
Be ready.
Will you come to him on your knees?
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
And are you afraid?
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
