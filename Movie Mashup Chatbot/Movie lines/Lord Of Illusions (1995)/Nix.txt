Liar!
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
You could still help me do that.
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Swann?  What are you doing?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
You don't think I've got it to give?
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
