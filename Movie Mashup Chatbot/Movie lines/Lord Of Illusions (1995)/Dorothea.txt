What is he?
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Why did you wait so long?
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
Harry-?
Is it finished?
Harry?
Don't look.
Yes.
I'm here, Harry.
Harry...
You can't.
Oh God!
Harry?
Are you all right?
What was that?
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
Yes.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
Are you sure?
I was so afraid.
Nothing?
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
I wasn't.
No.
I told you --
Some or it.
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
It was more than that, I think.
Oh Christ.
What did you find?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Yes.  You do that.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
That's my business. Harry.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
They were jealous of him.
How did it go today?
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
They won't tell you anything.
I don't know where you'd start.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Harry.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
You don't believe me.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
He's a secretive man.
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
I think we make our own futures.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
What about me?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
No word from D'Amour?
You saw this?
Valentin?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Oh God.
Sure.
... they believe you.
Bad show last night?
