You bet.
Hello, L.A.
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
How much?
Yeah?
Yeah.  It's French.
Thanks, Billy.
Hokey enough for you?
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Maybe they're not tricks.
A Nix specialty?
That's Butterfield...
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
My life was too weird for her.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
You heard right.
How?
Who is he?
Nix?
Who?
They go together.
Right.
Right.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
All right.  It was...
I told you --
Deep shit?
Beats me.
You did.  Didn't you?
Out!  Out!
What the fuck?
I think so.
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
I... have... to.
...yes?
... oh... God...
No!  No!  No!
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
I've got to help him.
Hang on!
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
It's okay.
Quaid and Jennifer--
And they all came...
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Nothing you don't want.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
I'm here, aren't I?
It's okay.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
What then?
You said you weren't with him for love.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
He taught all this to Swann?
Stuff?
He was the real thing, right?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
So why did you marry him?
You didn't marry him for love.
Why?  Because he had you?
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
I can be very persuasive.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Are they treating you okay?
He's good.
Sure.
Do you?
When do you want me to start?
I'm no bodyguard.
Harry.
Where do I sign?
Sorry.  You asked.
He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Does that mean...?
And you don't ask questions?
Why not?
What's the connection?
You don't?
Did your husband know Quaid?
No.  Not yet...
Are you finished with me?
--vanished.
He got up and walked.
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
With what?
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
I'd like to hear them.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
I heard he was the best.
What about Swann's miracles?
So could you walk on water?
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
Heaven and Hell?
You believe that?
What about?
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Shit...
I want to see Swann face to face.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Was that Swann's idea?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
No.
Shut up!
Yeah, I know.
When will she be in?
I want to speak to Dorothea.
No.
I like to know why things happen.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
What for?
Why'd you come here?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Who is she?
Are you sure?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Any movie stars buried here?
What's the difference?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
I saw him in Vegas once.
Philip Swann?
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Whose is the car?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Then what do you want?
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
What are you, my mother?
Go away.
Shit.
And what does Jennifer think's real?
Does anybody?
What's her problem?
I won't say anything.
A Mister Quaid?
Who is he?
The Puritan?
Hold on.
Not much.
Yeah.  You could say that.
What?
You need an ambulance.
Have you been in?
Are they all in the business?
I only wear ties for funerals.
Well... nobody.
For what?
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Sure.  Vivovich.
Not the Walter Wilder?
Was he taking a lot of risks?
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
Harry D'Amour.
That.
Where'd you learn that?
Try.
Can you do it?
He did something with the ground.
You didn't try hard enough.
Fuck.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
In my time, and nobody else's.
Nobody's better off this wav!
... no...
They got here before us.
Jesus!
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Did she know where Nix was buried?
And you believed him?
Is that all?
And he didn't have them?
And you're not?
Is that all?
Didn't know you read minds.
Oh Jeez.
Help me.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
Oh yeah?
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
Or murdered, like Nix.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
How the fuck do you do that?
Look, Ma, no wires.
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
What?
A couple of weeks.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
I got to go.  I'm late.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
And he's dead?
Is he the Puritan?
Who's not?
Swann?
What is?
Why's that?
What about Philip Swann?
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
No.
