Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
Not yet.
I'll tell you.
I don't know.
Don't.
Please.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
I left three messages already.
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
Good.  There.  Yes?
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Don't bother.
Him too.
Help me.
D'Amour --
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
I tried to pay you off.
Yes.
Yes.
Are you satisfied now?
Leave her alone --
You want more money, is that it?
I can't let you in.
I'm afraid she's not in.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Yes.  It's regrettable
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
A ticket home,
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Swann's wife.
Are you a believer, then?
I don't think the dead much care.
Probably.
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Are you a gambling man?
You know of him?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Maybe I just bought it.
Mine.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
I'm here to offer you a job.
We've never met.
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
It's one in the afternoon.
Mr. D'Amour?
