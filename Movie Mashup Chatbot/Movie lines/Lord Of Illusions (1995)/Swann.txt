No.  I'm not going near him.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
I just saw him.
Somebody killed him.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
I don't know.
Yes?
I can't... I can't go any further...
This is where we killed him.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
That's where we're all going.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
He's better off this way.
Looks that way.
Yes.
No.
I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
You think I'm an asshole.
Will that do?  No?
I don't know what else to do.
It's me betrayed him.
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
I did it for Dorothea.
He deserved it.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
They'll never find out.
No!
Yes.
Yes.
Not true.
Why would I want to?
And?
Binding you.
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
No!
Fuck you.
