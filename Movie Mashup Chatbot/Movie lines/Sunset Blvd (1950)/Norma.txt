I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
It's a good script, isn't it?
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
You heard him.  I'm a star!
That isn't true! Max?
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Wanted what?
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
That's a lie!  They still want me!
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
You think I made that up about the gun...
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Thank you, darling.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
Where are my cigarettes?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
You're a darling.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
This is the right day.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
Great stars have great pride.
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Go away.
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
What's the matter with you?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
"Mad about the boy."
I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
You think this is all very funny.
Hold me tighter.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Who?
Don't bend back like that.
Just follow me.
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Come here!
Come on!
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
How about some evening clothes?
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Cut away from me?
What scene?
What's that?
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
You'll like it here.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
You can stay here.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Where do you live?
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
I don't care.
I want you to do this work.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
What month?
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I will not have it butchered.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
I wrote that with my heart.
Of course it is.
Well?
I am not afraid.  Read it!
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Who else ?
We've made a lot of pictures together.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Are you or aren't you?
You're a writer, you said.
Just a minute, you!
Get out!
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Or shall I call my servant?
Get out.
It is not.  Get out.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
What is the scene? Where am I?
They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
Thank you, Max.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Who?
You know better than to interrupt me.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Bring something to drink.
