Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
Name dropper.
This is Miss Kramer.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Nothing for Ladd?
What's wrong with it?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Haven't got a thing.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Got a title?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
