I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
I'll take it.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
Good party.
Where's the bar?
Close, but no cigar.
That was the general idea.
Let it ride for a while.
In a deep freeze.
Hi, Artie.
Nobody asked you to.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Her own movie theatre.
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Hers.
You bet.
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
Come on in, Betty,
Hello, Betty.
What happened?
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
What is it you've heard.  Come on, let's have it.
Why not?
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
May I say you smell real special.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Nice job.
Second generation, huh?
What were you -- a child actress?
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
Who's who?
Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Good.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
So do I.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
It's just impossible.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
What has Artie to do with it.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
Check.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
What about all those ideas you had?
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
So long.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
I was afraid of that.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
Into what? A lampshade?
You did?
What teacher?
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Life can be beautiful!
You'll be waiting for me?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Well....
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
I had a teacher like that once.
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
How about the Rainbow Room?
Thank you.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Why, you sweet kid.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Thanks.
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
If I could be of any help...
Goodbye.  Norma.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
No, they don't.
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
Yes, I am, Norma.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
I went for a walk.
Why do you say that?
I think I'll read a little.
Good.
Good.
Good night.
Yes, Norma.
He must be quite a guy.
How did it go?
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
Where are your...?
I ran into some people I knew.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
Have one of mine.
When did he say it, Norma?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
Did she read the script?
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Cut out that us business.
Keep it.
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
What are the notes?
What's that?
A little.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
The other guests?
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
nan
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
I don't need a tuxedo.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
What's wrong with It?
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
I've lost my car.
I need some money right now.
They've come for my car.
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Okay.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Just a scene I cut out.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
I'll take care of that.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
I'll come early tomorrow.
There sure is.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
It's getting kind of late --
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Thank you.
December twenty-first.
I don't know.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
This is fascinating.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
They'll love it in Pomona.
Fair enough.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
And you'll play Salome?
Uh-huh.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Or teach it a better tune.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Why?
Yeah?
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
I wouldn't know.
And she's turned you into a servant.
You made her a star?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
What?
What's the matter, Max?
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
Right with you.
How is she?
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
Uh-huh?
What doctor?
How come?
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
Whose room was this?
Good.
I'm not here.
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
Is that so!
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
For me?  Okay.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Dressed for what?
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
You say the cutest things.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
What car?
That's right.
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Frankly, no.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
How's that about your being my friend?
No?
