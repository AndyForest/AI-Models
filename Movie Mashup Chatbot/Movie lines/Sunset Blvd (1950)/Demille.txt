Action! The scene starts.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
That's what I want to talk to you about.
We've missed you too, dear.
What's the matter, Norma?
