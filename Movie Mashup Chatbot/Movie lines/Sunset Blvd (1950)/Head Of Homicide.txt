Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
