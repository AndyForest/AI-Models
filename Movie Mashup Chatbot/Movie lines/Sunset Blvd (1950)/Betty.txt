Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
It's from hunger.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
If you love me, Joe.
Come on, Joe.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
No.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Why did she call me?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Whose?
Whose house is it?
This is where you live?
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
You did.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
I don't want it now.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I just don't.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
Twenty-two.
It must be my new shampoo.
If you please.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Who's Norma?
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
It will?
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Oh, you --
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
You're tough, all right.
Nobody can be that busy.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
We're engaged.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
I'll make it short.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
Why should you do that?
Well, for heaven's sake!
You sure have.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
I tell you this is half sold.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
He thinks it could be made into something.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
With a wildly beating heart.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
Phillip, you're mad!
Are you hungry?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
As for instance?
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
I didn't.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
I've been hoping to run into you.
You forgot this.
Hurt feelings department.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
