Last night?
Does Kat know?
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Your probably best off pretending you�re asleep.
You�d better get going. My parents will be �round to cart you off to the country.
Yeah.
You heading to the train station?
I look like a total wanker, don�t I?
Don�t be ridiculous. It�s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Fair enough, but I�m stepping on toes here and you�re waltzing around like...
I thought you said you were crap.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
Just because some slag�s been paid for, doesn�t mean you�ve got to...you know.
You are taking the piss?
Who�s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Doesn�t look like nothing.
And you do now?
Oh, shut up. You�re an optician.
But, somehow, it was Kat�s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
No.
Other than, he�s shagging your exgirlfriend?
What?
