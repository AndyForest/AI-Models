Nothing.
I didn�t deserve her back then.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
That�s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
And Kat was fully clothed.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
No, that�s not it.
There�s something about him that�s just a bit odd.
What�s his problem?
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
You Yanks and your therapy. It�s great.  It�s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Nothing, nothing.
Crikey.
Ah, a philosopher.
Oh, hello.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That�s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
I slept with your sister.
Brilliant.
Bollocks, I�m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
You�re not even listening.
It�s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It�s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don�t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Right. Seven.  Christ, that�s a long time, isn�t it?
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Kat, stop it. You do. You can�t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
Kat, wait. I don�t want you hating me. We�ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there�s something not quite right.
I have regrets.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I�d forget the rings.  I think I�m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Hey, Kat.
Seeing you again....
Hello, Katmandu.
