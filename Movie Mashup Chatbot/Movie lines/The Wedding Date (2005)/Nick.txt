Or Kat....
Still--
Actually, I do.
To make sure you�re okay.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
It�s not me. I swear. It�s her. She�s magic.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Yeah, kind of.
I�ll just check into a hotel.
I had to say something to get you here.
I�m a hooker.
It�s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
Um, just about everyone.
No, I can�t. We�re late for a dance lesson. I guess you�ll have to finish up later.
Hey, man.
No, tell me.
What?
Shrink, actually.
Hey.
Nice speech. I thought it was �touching�... and �funny.�
I have to.  I�m the best man.
I should go.
Hi.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you�ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
You�re judging me?! Oh, that�s a good one. You�re lying to me, you�re lying to your family, and you�re lying to yourself. But you�re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, we�ll go back to the real world and...and you�ll be hiring me for your best friend!
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
So what�s with the nickname?
And that�s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Fourteen and he�s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
Yeah. You?
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Make out with you for free.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
When I said I�d never done a wedding before, I didn�t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
Sure, but it�s never easy. They say they�re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they�re not.
It�s my job.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn�t one of them.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It�s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you�re not walking away!
Yup. That�s why you get to keep your money.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Not dollars. Pounds.
Don�t they have a limit at those machines?
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Is this for last night?
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
I�ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it�s the words: �morally repugnant.�
It�s hard to explain.
I disappear. It�s not about me.
I swear. I don�t have a signature move.
Don�t stop asking questions, okay?
I love that you�re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
There�s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
What do you think?
Are you asking me if I�m gay for pay?
When you�re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
Yes.
First of all, it�s never out of the blue. And second of all--
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn�t be violated.
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
Would you grab my shampoo?
Your �friend� guaranteed my anonymity.
How did you know that was me?
This happened to you?
That�s right. Imagine facing it alone.
Not the way you�re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
A weekend?
You stand on your tiptoes.
It�s cute.
Who are they?
You quitting?
It�s okay. Hell, I�ve never paid for it. But please don�t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you�re so cute, I�ll take care of our incidentals.
Why?
You�re too good for him.
I don�t know.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he�s still crazy about you.
Love.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they�re naked.
Both.
Mmm.
Mission accomplished.
You�re funny.
What color are my shoes?
You think we look like we�re trying too hard.
Kat.
Will do.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation�s most precious resource: your daughter.
I am now, sir.
I�m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
