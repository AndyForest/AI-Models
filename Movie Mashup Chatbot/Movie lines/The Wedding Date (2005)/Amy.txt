Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you�re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you�ve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn�t outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn�t feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don�t know, but your misery just isn�t working for me anymore.
You know what? I�m not having this conversation right now.
Hey.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
I�m fine. I promise.
I should get going.
God, Kat! Please. Don�t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don�t worry about it.
The wedding.  I am so, so bad! I don�t think I should be allowed to get married.
I don�t think I can go through with this.
Bacardi 151.
Oh, shut up and be happy. It�s always this or that. You�re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
But I�m not taking your name, buster. I�m a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
Perfect. All ginny.
Exactly! Today�s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
You know what I love about all this?
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
If Ed ever found out....
It was such a long time ago.
You know all that �if these walls could talk� stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
What for?
Fred Astaire and what�s her face!
Jeffrey told her last night.
Say something. Please.
Whatever you do, don�t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
