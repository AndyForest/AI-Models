Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn�t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn�t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.

I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
Oh, don�t be that way.

I�m not as square as my daughter thinks.
Why, with you.
