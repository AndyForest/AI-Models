I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
