No one.
Yeah, you told me that later.
I remember.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
Yeah.
Thanks, guys.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I can't stop thinking about you.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I don't know.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Says you were a bully...
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Have sex. Y'know --
Listen, did you want to make love?
I think I should go back.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
I love you.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
I think we should go.
Naomi.
It's dark.
I knew.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
What are you doing?
Female.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Um, no.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Seems too coincidental that way.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I think she's great.
I love her.
Okay.
yeah?
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
I know.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
I'm Joel.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
You said --
You know what I did.
Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
You said...
Hi.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I remember that speech really well.
Okay.
Not yet. Not married.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
I did it. I guess that means something.
I told her today I need to end it.
It's very late.
I dropped you off after. You said --
And I didn't have an argument.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
I'm sure, I said.
We did talk about Naomi.
Right. Something black though.
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Yeah.
Do you remember what we talked about?
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
I scoured the city for it.
Happy Birthday.
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
There's this guy!
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
No.
Yeah, Tangerine?
No. Thanks.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
No, it isn't that.
You're drunk.
So, um --
Oh, thank God. It's going.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
I don't want to talk about this here.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
I don't think we're ready.
Let's talk about it later.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
Where are you going?
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
Let me drive you home.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
It's three.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
Okay.
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Yes.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Okay.
I think so.
That's scary sounding.
Oh, yeah.
No, not at all.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Yeah.
Thanks.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I think about that.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
I don't know.
Yeah?
Thanks.
No. I --
Well, I should probably get going.
You just say. I'm not really --
What do you want to hear?
No, I'm okay for now.
I'm fine.
Cheers.
It's pretty.
Frost?
I don't know.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Very much.
Um --
Take care.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
What?
Sort of, um...
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
I like to read.
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Yeah.
I'm not a stalker.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Where do you live?
It's okay.
You're sure? It's cold.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Probably see you at the book store.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
That's okay.
Yes?
Okay.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
I'm not nuts.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
I'm Joel.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
I'm sure you would.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
I don't really know how --
I can't remember.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I like it.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I don't have one.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Really? Because --
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
Rockville Center.
It's okay, really.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
Why what?
I'm sorry.
Jesus.
I don't know. Panties and --
You must have been crazy.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Hi, it's Joel.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
It's true.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I guess so.
Oddly enough, I do.
I just walked in.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
I just got in.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
How's it going?
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
Clementine.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
Okay. I wish you could come.
Naomi.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
How's the chicken?
And what are you like? A wino?
Any messages, Carmen?
So then she just stops calling.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
Clementine.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
I should maybe talk to you.
It's them.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
Fuck you, Clementine.
I might be making a mistake.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
It was snowing.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
You have to stop this!
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
Well... I did.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
We'll speak soon.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Oh! Great. That's great!
I miss you.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I hope you get your work done.
So you don't mind?
In a minute.
Go back to sleep.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Hi.
It's not somebody else.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
You take it. I don't know.
