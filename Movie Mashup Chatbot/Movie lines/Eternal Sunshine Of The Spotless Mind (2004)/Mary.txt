Here we are.
How are you today?
Ms. Kruczynski?
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
May I help you?
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Then why did you ask me?
Nothing.
What do you want, Stan?
Oh.
Thanks, Stan.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
And after that?
How did I look?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Do you swear you didn't know?
Hell no.
He's coming?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Well, what should we do?
Where?
What?
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
It's freezing out.
I better do this, Stan.
'kay.
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Stan... c'mon...
Hi.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
You made me have an abortion.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
What, Howard?
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
You are such a sweetheart.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Welcome, Howard.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Yes?
Howard, your one o'clock.
