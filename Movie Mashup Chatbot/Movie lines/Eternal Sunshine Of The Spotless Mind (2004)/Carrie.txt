Who was the girl you walked off with?
I told you that later.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
I did. You said, things were fine.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Say hi to Naomi.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Sweetie, we called the company.
You weren't supposed to see that.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
