Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
You did? You liked me?
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Okay, I guess.
Hi.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
What's wrong with me?
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
I'm so excited. Yay!
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Come up to Boston with me?
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
In the room?
You rat.
Come over after I'm done here?
You were not.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
Okay, I guess.
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Doesn't sound like me.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
A bully? Moi?
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I'm nervous, too.
Hey, Joel --
That's okay. I --
Oh, um...
Make love?
Joel, come here. Please.
What if?
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
When?
So you'll call me, right?
Bye, Joel.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
What if you stay this time?
So go.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
It's freezing out here.
Cool.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Male or female?
Oh.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
I wish we did. You married?
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Yeah, maybe.
I think, before.
Me too. There's this poem --
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
What do we do?
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
Yeah, like that.
Oh God, how horrid.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Hi there.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
I know.
Probably.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Well, you're married.
Yeah?
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Is that what you want?
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Come up and see me... now.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
But you weren't. I could tell.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
Egad, were you horrified?
What was I wearing?
Naomi, I guess.
This is our first "date" date.
Yeah.
I love it!
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Joel!
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Really? Is he cute?
What?
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
You remember what happened next?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I'm right here.
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
What if you hide me?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Oh?
Such a beautiful view.
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Joely...
More?
Joel, you're a liar.
I want to know you.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
Would you get me another, Joely?
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
What?!
You're not ready.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I want to have a baby.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
How can you watch this crap?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Yo ho ho!
You didn't say anything about my hair.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
When?
You'll call me, right?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Okay.
You should stay.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Yeah? Oh, great!
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I know a man who needs a refill.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
You pick it.
Ready for another?
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
You like that?
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
You know Wilmont?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Yeah?
I don't want to take you out of your way.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Huckleberry Hound?
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Yeah, I got it.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Oh. So...
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Really?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Why?
