'Night.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I'm glad you called.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
I'm sorry.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Yeah.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
How was it?
Hi.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
What?
So what's going on, Joel?
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
Yours?
