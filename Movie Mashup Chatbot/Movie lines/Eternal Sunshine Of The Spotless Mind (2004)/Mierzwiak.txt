I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
How are you today?
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
What? What do you mean?
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
It was a mutual decision.
I have a family, Mary.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
We can't do this.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
That's lovely.
It's no big deal.
Alexander Pope?
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
Is that Nietzsche?
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
How do you mean?
Well, thank you, Mary.
Okay, we're back in.
Thanks.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Mary...
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Well, where was Patrick?
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Stan? What's going on?
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
That's fine, Stan.
Oh dear.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Mary. What are you doing here?
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
