Your dried cum.
Guess what I'm wearing.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Yeah?
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
What took you so long?
