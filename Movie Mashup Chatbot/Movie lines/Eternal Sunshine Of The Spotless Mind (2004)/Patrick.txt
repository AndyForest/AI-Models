Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Oh, Tangerine.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
In the world.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
I was not.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
Definitely!
Very cool. Trippy.
Yeah. Cool.
Nah, I don't know.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
What's your bartlett's?
Okay, There's more, Stan --
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Does that help?
The voltage looks fine.
