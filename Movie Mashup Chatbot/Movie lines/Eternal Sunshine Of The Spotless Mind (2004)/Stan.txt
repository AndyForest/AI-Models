Mary... please. This is hurting people.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
I know what it is.
What's this?
Can I... I brought some --
Hi.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Happy. Happy with a secret.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
Once, maybe.
I swear.
Hey.
You better go.
No way. I can handle this.
Shit!
I don't know! I just said that!
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
I don't know. He's not on the map.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Listen, it's not erasing.
It's stopped.
You love him, don't you?
Yeah.
Go.
Yup.
Yup.
It's a good one all right.
That's a good one.
We haven't checked.
You found us okay?
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
See you later, alligator.
I know. Anyway --
Sorry. I just --
Boo.
Jesus.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Yeah. Of course.
I tried that already.
She came to help, Howard.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
It's a quote book.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Jesus, Patrick!
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Patrick, we need to focus.
This one's history. Moving on...
You can if you want.
She likes you okay.
Just wanted to let you know.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
It's an apartment.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Then check the connections.
