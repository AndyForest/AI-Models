When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
Why?  If they could never take title.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
I said.  No further questions.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
Well, it seems to me...
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Why not?
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
Well, what then, sergeant?
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
And the last...?
And the next one...?
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
And why.  Is that?
Did you say more?
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.

You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
Greedy.
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Objection!  Speculation.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
Robbed.  He was angry.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
