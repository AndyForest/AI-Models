Pretty darn clear.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
You said three minutes.
I did.  Boy.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
You always run with the well open?
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
What else could it be?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
I don't think so.
I believe so.
Apparently.
No.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
It is.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Maybe.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
