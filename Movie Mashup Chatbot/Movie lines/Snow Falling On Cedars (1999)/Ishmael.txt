Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
The Japs did it.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
Why?  We're only talking.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
...but he found you.
Those aren't the facts that matter.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
He didn't want to lose any more.
Like you couldn't believe.
Oh, yes.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Twelve.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
How long you have this detail?
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
You're right.  I better use two.
Have a look.  At nothing.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
Won't take two.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
We don't let go, you s...
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Cigarette?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
He hit his head.  On the way in.
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
That's when he fell.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Yes, he was.
You're wondering why I held it.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
