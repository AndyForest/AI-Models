...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
You don't.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
It is.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Well, what if?
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
Now, Mister Gi...
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
Objection!
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
I'll take two.  One for later.
Well, anything coulda caused that.
You think so?
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
The knife.  What knife?
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Maybe...?
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Still lashed to the mast.
Fell.
Well, why does it?
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
No, you don't.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
I think you like learning.
White or black?
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
And her farmhouse...?
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
No spare.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
You have to wonder.
Does it now?
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Are you absol...
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Is it possible?
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
