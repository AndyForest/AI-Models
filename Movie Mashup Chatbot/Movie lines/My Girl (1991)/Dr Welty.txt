What Hurts Vada?
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
No.
Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
You are perfectly healthy.
