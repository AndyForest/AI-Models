Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
No.
Cause she's dying.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
What are you saving for?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
I'm allergic to it.
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Would you think of me?
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Okay.
You better not either.
Umm, Ummmmm
Okay, okay.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Like this?
But, I don't know how.
No.
Like they do on TV?
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Okay, seeya.
You can come to my house for dinner?
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
I do, she's real funny.
So now you'll have a mother.
They're getting married?
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
Why are you running away?
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
Really?
I wanna live with them too.

You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
Can we go yet?
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.

I told you i'll get in trouble.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Don't DO that!!
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?

I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
I'm trying.
Oh no!  UUH.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
It doesn't work, it always stays black.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
At what?
