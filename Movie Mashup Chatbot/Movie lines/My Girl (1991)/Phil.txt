No, no no....
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Why?
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Probably.
He likes her.
