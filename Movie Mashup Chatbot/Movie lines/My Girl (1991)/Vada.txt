Wanna play?
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Arthur!!
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
You're such a baby.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
It's there.
Can't you see it?
Yes.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Do you miss her?
Really?
What was my mama like?
In the garage.
I found this.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Did I kill my mother?
Get away, get away!!
He's okay isn't he?
Why not?
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Yes.
Feeding my fish.
Hi.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I like the freak show.
Yes..
When??
When?
Are they ready yet?
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
Sorry.
Can I go too?
Why?
You never cared before.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
The money?
Dad??
Dad?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Then who's it for?
Is it for a child?
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Dad?
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Ahem.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Get away from me!
No....
Who's that?
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
I wrote a poem too.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
I paid the money.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
What do you get for that?
How much does it cost?
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
This is one big house for one single person.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
My Dad was funny?
Really?
Why?
Do you like her?
Does he love her?
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Goodnight.
I will I promise.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
I think it should be outlawed.
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
I'm eleven and a half.
I don't want, I don't need your help....
I'm hemorrhaging.
Where's Daddy?
Daddy??!?!?!
NO!
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
I won, I won!!!
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Are you here to take Shelly back?
I like my name.
See food!
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Hi.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
No.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Are you going out somewhere?
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Are you married?
What are they about?
Did you read ALL these books?
I would.
Big Ringo fan.
Can we look around in your camper?
My ball, I lost my ball.
He won't give it to me.
Shut your big fat mouth!
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
He's allergic to everything.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
I am.
She's shy.
That's really cool.
Is that your camper?
For what?
What?
Seeya tomorrow.
Well, let's spit on it.
Just, hurry.
Say something it's too quiet.
Okay on the count of three.
Just do it.
Close your eyes.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Uh huh.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Not true.
It is not.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
I dunno..
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
No, I'm hiding out.
Leave then, some friend you are.
Then go home, baby.
He likes her better than me.
I don't like her.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Get up!?
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Do it!
Jump in the water!!
I am running faster!!
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
What do you want it for anyway?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
So?
What?
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
What?
Go???
Duck!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Bed wetter!
Pacifist!
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Sorry.
Here.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
What?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
It's my mother.
Yes.
Never mind.
You have no personality.
Hmmmm, interesting.
Come on, it's fun.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
No.
Uh huh.
It'll bleed.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Hurry!
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
No, I'm going home.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
I knew he wouldn't come.
