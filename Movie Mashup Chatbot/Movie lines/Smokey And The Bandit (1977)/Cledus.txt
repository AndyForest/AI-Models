Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
I'm cucumber cool.
I'm here.
I'm all ears.
Let's boogie.
Talk to me.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
I'll believe it when I see it.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
Now what?
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Bandit?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
I hate to say it...
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
I'm at marker eight-five.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
Do I have a choice?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy.
Bandit?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
Bandit I, do you copy?
Save it. We got a long haul.
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Hit the brakes!
You know how to drive one of these things?
Liquid gold.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
He's history.
Loud and clear.
Why are we doing this?
Bandit?
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
What are you doin' now?
But I still don't think...
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
No.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Waynette!
Or in the slammer.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
No.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Yes, ma'am.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
Shut up, Fred.
Where the hell are you?
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
