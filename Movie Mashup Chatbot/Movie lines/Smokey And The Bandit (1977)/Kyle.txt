You got my barley pop?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
What's he get if he wins here?
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
That crazy sumbitch made it.
Chickenshit money.
Now, you just find him, son.
That's the point, Dickey.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
