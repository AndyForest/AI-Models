Your what?
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
What do you think?
You paying for the gas?
How much style?
Last year, this was a new rig.
You know how rumors start.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
If...?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
See ya, Kate.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
Absolutely.
That man is your father?!?
What can I say?
Hey...
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
Weight Station.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
Bandit II?
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
And?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Kate...
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
I'm proud of you.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
An unmarked police car.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Let's hit it.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Mississippi's the other way!
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
You could've asked.
Yeah.
By stealing my car?
You know this guy, don't you?
What the hell are you doing?!?
See ya, Kate.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Hey...
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Well?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
Shoot.
Anything?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
I give up.
Would I lie to you?
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
They're both a challenge.
Driving?
Having fun.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Okay.
A what?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
But you'll do it?
I'm begging.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
Another time.
That's me.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Yeah, but...
How's the clock, Bandit II.
What's that, pardner?
You're coming up to the scale house.
Bandit II?
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
-- How we doing?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
You okay?
We'll be waiting. Over.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
We're outta motion lotion.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
Never mind. It's nothing.
We're gone.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Then don't.
I ran into complications.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
What's your twenty?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
Yeah, guy?
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
What does the old Timex say?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Not for long, you ain't.
What's your twenty?
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
You can't swear on these.
This is Bandit I, come back.
Clear and rolling.
I hate to say I told you so.
We still on schedule?
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
Let's get the hell outta here.
They're jammed!
Can a pig whistle?
Redneck heaven.
Let's keep it that way.
Shit! No one's here.
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Yeah?
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Six. Got it.
Go.
Running blocker.
Also boring.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
How long's this gonna take?
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
See.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
How'd you know?
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
Cledus.
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Pick it up, Breaker.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Go head on, breaker.
Go breaker.
About one to five years worth.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
