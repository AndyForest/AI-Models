Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Breaker. Breaker.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Breaker. Breaker.
