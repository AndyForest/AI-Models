See ya, Bandit.
What are you thinking?
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
He's just exhausted.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
Well, thanks for the lift.
One to five?
Why are you stopping?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
What kind of a guy is he?
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
My very words.
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Ummm?
Yeah?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
How do you know?
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
Uh-oh.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Like what?
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Yeah.
I would've come back for you.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
He's after us again!
Ciao.
Jesus!!!
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Eleven.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
We lost him.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
You know, you're not a bad driver.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Can I ask you something?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
What the hell's going on?
You just passed your nemesis.
Guess what?
Seriously?!?
Where you from?
You have a great profile.
Driving, talking to me...
Is this fun?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Well?...
So tell me about yourself.
Eyes on the road.
An existentialist.
But you could get killed, right?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Who'd want to?
Why? You have a bowling date?
Why're you driving so fast?
Kate McConnell.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Bandit two, you read me?
How's your twenty?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
What's he...
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Who's Fred?
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
This is Bandit I. Over.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
