Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
And the Lord told that man --
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
You have all sinned!
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
The money, Icey.
There's something else.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
John don't like him much.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
I'm through, Harry.
Yes.
I -- no, I --
Harry, what --
No, Harry! I thought --
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
Harry!
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
