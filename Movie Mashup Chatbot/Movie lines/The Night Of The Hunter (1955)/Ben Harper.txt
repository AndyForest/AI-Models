Keep talkin', Preacher.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
I'll bet.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
You, Preacher?
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Hm!
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
You understand?
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
Here they come.
Listen to me John.
Where's your Mom?
