He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
He lied!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Bluebeard!
Lynch him! Lynch him!
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
A man of the Cloth?
All to pieces!
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Sshhh! He's in there.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Walt!
About what!
Say what, Walt Spoon!
How do you mean?
Plan on a longer visit next time.
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
It's a shame!
Get along with you.
You go set down by the River.
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
What?
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
Pearl dotes on him.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
Fiddlesticks!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
What!
How?
Amen.
Ah.
What could have possessed that girl!
Mister Powell!
Amen! Amen!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
