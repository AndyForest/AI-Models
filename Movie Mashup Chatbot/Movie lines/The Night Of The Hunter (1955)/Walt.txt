String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Tricked us!
Come on!
Twenty-five wives!
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
What can we do, Mother?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Is he hit pretty bad?
Just went?
I'll be switched!...
Who?
What's wrong, Mother?
Mother, I only --
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
So you ain't with the State no more?
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
What do you figure to do?
How's that?
The first night?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
Mister Powell?
