And I won't never tell about the money.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Not even her?
Yes, Dad.
Dad, you're bleeding...
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
Uncle Birdie!
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
No.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Just fine.
O, she's all right.
When'll the skiff be ready?
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
I been mindin' Pearl.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Ssh...
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Hush.
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
No, that's just it. No.
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Someone is after us, Pearl.
Yes, I reckon that's it.
She's gone to Moundsville.
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
Pearl! You ain't --
You what?
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
You swore, Pearl!
Hm?
Sshhh...
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
'Cause you're too little.
You better not sing that song.
Blue men.
There! What's so hard about that!
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
I'll see to Pearl.
He ain't my Dad.
I mind you said there was two.
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Up river.
Dead.
She talks to herself.
Don't you hurt her!
Nothin'.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Under the stone in the floor.
Yonder.
Don't you believe me?
What?
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
I'll tell.
I don't know nothin'!
Yes. Yes.
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
It -- she --
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
No. No.
Nothin'!
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Huh?
Is that all?
