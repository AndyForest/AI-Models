Where's Ruby?
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
I'll make coffee.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
Story, honey? Why, what story?
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Where ye from?
Dead.
John, where's your folks?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
What are you after them for?
What do you want?
What's wrong, John?
What's wrong, John?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
She took them kids with her?
Where's she at?
Where's your Missus?
Them kids is yours?
It's about that John and that Pearl?
How'do.
What?
John and Pearl!
What'd you all talk about?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Now who was this?
What you been up to?
The Drugstore?
When did I ever?
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
