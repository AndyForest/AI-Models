John?
It'll spoil our supper.
I'm hungry, John.
Where are we goin', John?
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Why?
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
To see Dad?
Where's Mom?
It's all here.
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
John! Don't!
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
Now can I tell?

'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
The Blue Men?
Tell me a story, John.
Why?
Hing, hang, hung.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Because John said I mustn't.
No.
Can I have milk too?
Can I have my supper please?
I'm hungry.
John's bad.
All right.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
That's no secret. I'm five.
What secret shall I tell?
Yes?

Mm-hm.
