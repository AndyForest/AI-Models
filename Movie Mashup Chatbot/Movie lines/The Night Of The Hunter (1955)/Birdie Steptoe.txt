Don't!
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Leavin', boy?
How's your sister Pearl?
And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
