Whistler, I --
No, we can treat the wounds --
Don't try to talk --
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
Don't even start, old man.
Get in. Youï¿½re leaving.
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
Stupidity.
Just do it, old man.
She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
She's been bitten.
Whistler!
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
Who dies first?
Frost!!!
You're not going anywhere.
Pass.
You're wrong.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
I don't buy it.
How can you be out here?
But I just got here --
How do I stop it?
"The Blood Tide".
Who is LaMagra?
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
You're blind --
For them. But for me --
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
No --
-- tearing me -- apart.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
Get out of here --
What are you talking about?
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
How long have we been driving?
I've been better --
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
You don't look so good.
Any progress?
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
Cancer.
For your miracle cure?
Just get out of here.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
You get used to the darkness.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Some kind of archive --
Like me.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
The way they move, they way they smell --
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
He will.
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
Look closer.
What do you see here?
There is no cure.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
Preventive medicine.
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
He didn't. Get over it.
It worked, didn't it?
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
-- he's a vampire.
You shouldn't be here.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
I was in the neighborhood.
How's it going, Kam?
I don't believe that.
You don't have to be.
How could you be a part of this?
Please --
Fight him --
But you -- died --
