It's what you wanted isn't it?
I did it for you.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down!
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
What's the matter?
Can I forget it?
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
You are good to me Sam.
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Here. What do I do next?
What?
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
27156789/074328/K.
Next of kin!
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
The refund for Tuttle!
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
You've been promoted.
Would you really, Sam?
But if they did promote you
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
Oh, good!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Oh my God, a mistake!
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
