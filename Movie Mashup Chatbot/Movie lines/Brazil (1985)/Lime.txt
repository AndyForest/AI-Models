Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself.
Hey - that's my desk!
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
Sod it, it's broken!
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
This is your dream girl, is it?
A woman eh? I see.
I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing.
You want to take my console into your office?
What?
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
