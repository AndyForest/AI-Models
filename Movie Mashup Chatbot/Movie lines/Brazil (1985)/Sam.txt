What have you done to my flat?
I fixed it myself.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
Thank you.
Uh - what? - I ...
What do I have to do.
What? You mean you've got ...
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
What? How do you know my name?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Oh, right ...
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Er ... Thanks ...
He will be pleased when he comes home.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Go away.
No, no ... I did that...
Please, I've got to find Jill.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Help me!
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Well ... well, I ...
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Sorry ...
Well, I ...
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Jack ...
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
What?
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Jack?... Jack?
Yes we have, Jack!
Jack, she's innocent!
It could all be coincidental.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Trust me.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Say it was a mistake.
Take her off the list.
They weren't at school with us.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
And you're mine.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
So what are you going to do about her?
Out of kindness.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
A terrorist?
Tell me about Layton.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Er ... no.
What's she done?
He's a freelance subversive?
What has Tuttle done?
So how ...?
I'm sure you have
You killed him?
You got the wrong man.
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Not really, no.
Not much.
How do you mean?
Am I?
What is it?
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
Ah ...
Yes, thanks.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Are you officer 412/L?
Jack!!
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
Er, I knew you looked different.
Hello, Jack!
Really? - God, how time flies!
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Even later.
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
You sound worried.
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Jack!
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Are you sure?
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
What happened to you after ...
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
I'm going to open it!
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
"And your children all gone."
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Oh God! What have we done?
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
I was right! Step on it!
Turn!
Will you please turn back.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop!
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Security.
They'll be there waiting.
Turn around!
Every day?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
Well, terrorists of course.
Well, all wars do -
Well, no system is.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Suit me?
Really.
Looking for you.
It's heavy.
OK. What's in the parcel?
What's going on here?
Where are you taking me?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What?
Why not?
Why?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Yes, of course. Sorry.
You know, smoking's bad for you.
I don't know.  Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Oh, sorry.
Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them!
Please!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Ow! That hurt!
Don't look back! Act naturally!
It's you ... it's you ...
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
What! Shit!
I never signed the form.
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
I know that.
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
Damn! Blast!
Yes.
I delivered it.
Don't mention it. See you later.
That's it.
Here.
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
Try next of kin.
He is dead.
Hang on.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Tuttle?
A cheque.
What a BITCH!
Really.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Don't worry.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
Information Retrieval.
It's not our mistake!
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have ï¿½31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Lime, I need to use your computer
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
You haven't switched it on.
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
Yes.
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Sam Lowry.
How long will she he away?
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
My mother said it would be all right.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Actually, I've decided ...
I want to talk to him.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Mother? Is that you?
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Mother!
This isn't rare!
What is it?
You're not listening, mother.
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
Uh ...
Um ...
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Er, yes ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
I ... uh ...
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Whatever happened to you?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
What? Who is this?
Who's that?
Hello ... hello ...
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
This is an emergency!
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
Thank you, Dawson.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
But I could be anybody.
My I.D. cards.
Er, don't you want to search me?
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
what? ... Oh ...
I don't know which numero.
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
Are we?
What is it?
For God's sake, what's happened?
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
What?
What is it?
What the - ? How did you - ?
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
Have you got one or haven't you?
I mean it fixed itself.
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Yes?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
What do they want you or?
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
No. Wait here.
Can you fix it?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
The pace?
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Are you saying this is illegal?
What?
But ... I called Central Services.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
