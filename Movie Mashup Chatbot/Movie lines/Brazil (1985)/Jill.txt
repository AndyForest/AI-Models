Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
I bet you'd like to touch them?
You think these are tits don't you?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
Where do I get it stamped?
Stamped?
Yes.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Take care.
Don't do anything silly.
Where are you going?
Don't you like parties?
Yes.
They're gone.
Your face ... are you hurt?
Yes.
No you're not!
Oh ... Jesus!
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Leave me alone!
Go away.
Are you still following me?
Yes.  Come out, I know you're in there
What?
Shit! The house is on fire!
We? Don't blame me!
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Stop it ... damn you!
Get away!
Cut it out, Sam.
I thought you arrested me.
You're joking.
Who will?
What?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Look at that - right on time.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Who is this war against, Sam?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
We've got both.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
No, really.
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
A heavy Christmas present.
What parcel?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
It does doesn't it?
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
I didn't like it.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
It's my fucking life.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Don't litter my cab!
Them?
No.
Who are you?
Good!
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
Who are you? Let go!
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Are you alright?
