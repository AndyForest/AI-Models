Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Beginner's luck.
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.

Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Too late? That's for me to say.
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...

If I can help you ...
Thanks very much Sam.
