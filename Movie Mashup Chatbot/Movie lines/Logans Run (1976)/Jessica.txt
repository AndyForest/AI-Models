...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
When do you go up?
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Where do you live, Mary?
What's your name?
Is it inside the city?
What does that water do?
Beloved husband...
And Sanctuary?
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
To what?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
Then the answer's yes...
...But I still have the choice...?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
What does it mean?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Don't ever let go.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Don't!
I hate outside! I hate it!
And yours.
What's that?
For us.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
I'm afraid.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
What do you suppose this was...?
How do we know this is the right way?
Will you take me with you?
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
We'll convince them.
They won't listen.
They won't believe us.
He's good, isn't he?
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
No. Not that either.
I -- I can't.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
But what is this -- why?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
I have.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Some people say children need human mothering.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
I'd rather be with you.
You're not going, are you?
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
Of course --
I wish I knew what you think I know.
I wish I could help you.
What're you going to do?
What do you need?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Please? What friends?
I don't..
And then you killed him, right?
Where did you get that?
How can I?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
About running, dying what?
Why tell me?
Why show me?
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Then it's still no.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
You could have called me yourself.
K.
Six. I go red next year.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
Why is it wrong to run?
I'm afraid to tell you.
Not about that.
How a Sandman lives.
Curious.
I changed my mind.
I thought I had to do something.
No.
No.
Jessica.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
He was killed.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
No.
No.  Just no.
Please... No.
Goodbye.
Come with us.
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
At least it's over...
What's that?
What people?
What belongs to the people?
No.
I don't know.
Are you sure?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
