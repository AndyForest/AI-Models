No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
I feel sorry for you, boy!
I'm a Sandman!
What other food?
How did they get in here?
We're ready.
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
How do you want us?
It'll be all right...
That's better.  How do you want us?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
Answer the question!
Where do you send them?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
Where do you think we came from?
How do you think we got here??!!
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
All right -- what are you?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Just the face.
Your own work?
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
It has nothing to do with you.
I'm fine...  See you...
Anybody we know?
Did you?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
That was a great shot you made.
Who invited you?
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
Well... you can't have them all.
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.
Did you ever see Francis-8?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Just wondered... what happens?
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
Beloved wife...
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Yes. You and I, Jessica.
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
Things change!
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
We can't. We're going back.
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
One in a million, I suppose
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
It could be...
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
Of course.
You know, Jessica.
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
I won't.
I doubt it.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
We'll be all right...  We will...
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
It's the only way.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
How will they know we're coming?
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Are you taking me to them?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Let's see -- how long has it been?
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Uh-uh.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
They're like beasts. Wild.
That's nice.
Why not? Maybe she'll help me. You won't. You'd better stay here.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
If you did know, you'd tell me.
Maybe you'll think of something...
That's tomorrow.
Are you here to help me?
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
I don't have much time.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
I let him go... believe me.
A Runner gave it to me.
It's different now. Help me.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
You know something.
I'm going to run.
All right.
You know.
Of course.
Maybe... sure...
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
You're sure you don't want to try?
What Quad do you live in?
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
Are you a 5 or a 6?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
I'm not armed.  Well?
I'm listening.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
About what?
And now?
And?
But you put yourself on the circuit!
Later.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
You felt sad. What's your name?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
Sad? What made you sad?
Well then...?
You prefer women?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
What's wrong, Available?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
Hello.
Can you make it back?
I'm sorry.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
More... many more.
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
We're leaving.
Not yet.
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Where are they?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
What makes you think so?
Have any other people ever passed through?
Are there any other humans?
How did you get here?
What kind of place is this?
How long have you been living here?
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
