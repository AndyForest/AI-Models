Oh, my...
Where are you going?
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
I'll make the arrangements.
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
We'll have to bury him.
I don't know... but it does.
All this. All of it.
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
What kind of jewel is this?
Mother and Father said so... you know?
Yes...
Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES."  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
Oh my... I'll try.
Yes...
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Oh, yes... I think...
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
That's better than gold when it's cold.
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
And all alive you say?
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Alive?
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
All right.
Are you ready to put him in?
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
No, no, no
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
Gracious... no.
I have always been here...
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
For as long as I can remember.
