Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Up there.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
You're a beautiful pair.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
From? From? From?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
Anything to eat?
Your turn.
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
