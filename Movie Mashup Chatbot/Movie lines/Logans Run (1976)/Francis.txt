Why did you do that???!!!
Why did you do that??!!
What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
What's going on, Logan?!
At Carousel tonight?
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
Of course.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
What the hell took you so long?
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
I'm in my party mood.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
You missed something special.
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
Why?
Not in my time...
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Had enough?
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
