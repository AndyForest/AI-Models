My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
Do you want to see Doc?
Hello, Sandman.
