Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
