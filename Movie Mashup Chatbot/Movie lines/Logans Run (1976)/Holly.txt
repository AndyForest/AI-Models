Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
