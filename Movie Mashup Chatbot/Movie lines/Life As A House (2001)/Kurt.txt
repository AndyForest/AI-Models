Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
We've known each other since grade school.
You've been good this week.

From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
God, you look like crap, George.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I know there's an explanation.
At least your father tried, George.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Left you this place.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
What the fuck?
What are you talking about?
He said he heard hammering.
