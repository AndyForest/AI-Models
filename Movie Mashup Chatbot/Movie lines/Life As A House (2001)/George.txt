What did you think it would be?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
You have to ask like that?
You're a good girl.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
Can you keep Sam straight?
I had them in my pocket.
My keys.
What's today?
Don't you have school?
I'm living here while I build another house.
Alyssa.
Why?
Are you his friend?
He must.
I'll survive.
That would take weeks.
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
I have the permit.
It's thirty feet.
If that's what it takes.
I flushed it down the toilet.
A sink?
And if I enclosed it?
A violation?
I've been dreading you.
Yes, it is.
Thank you.
I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
I've got one favor to ask.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
For everything.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
I hate this job.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
How old are you?
Maybe...?
I've been here twenty years.
I'm not.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
He buys and sells the world.
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Pardon me?
I'm good, thanks.
Hello?
I forgot where I put my keys.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
I don't wanna go, Sam.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
Yes.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.

Are you taking them still?
She seemed upset.
You look better than ever.
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
After everything.
I loved him too much.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
To hide a black eye.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
What would you be doing now?
I gave up on you.
I wish you had told me then.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
I know parts of who you are.
That's not true.
What are you now?
What would you like to be?
I know the feeling.
I know.  Why?
Hi, Alyssa.
Try it.  It feels good.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
Sit down for a second.
The gloves on the table are for you.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
I might have a solution.
A friend of yours is here.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
When are you going to be back?
Where are you going?
Hey...hey!
You'll have money when you work for it.
I can promise you complete privacy.
I don't beg.
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
It'll be fine.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
You'll have money when you work.
I don't know.
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
It bugs me.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
No you don't.
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
I warned you yesterday.
Goodnight.
I almost saw Catalina.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
You don't have a choice.
You have everything?
I'll get your bag.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
Because I live there.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
I haven't been touched in years.
I can die trying.
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
You know what mortise and tenon is?
I'd build a house.
Good for you.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
I want you to find someone for me.
I need you to do me a favor.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
Ah!  Oh....
Thanks for telling me.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
I aimed high.
She's a little sad, is all.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Oh.  Sorry.
Three.
Not a perfect day.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
It's not my back that's killing me.
So could I.
What?
What did he say?
Left you?
No.  Mostly me.
I didn't think you'd come today.
You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
Let's not do this, okay?
You bit my finger.
I can't pick you up.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
That was the truth.
What did I say?
Going on?
I can hire workers to help me.
I'd rather you not be here.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
It's been a while.
I think so.
You're a good mother.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
You brought your kids?
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
My stupid back.
With your hands or your tongue?
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
Oh...with his ear infection!
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Finished or unfinished?
It's not breakfast yet.
What is it?
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
Which?
But you hated four out of the five you did.
What?
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
Let's go.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
I can't leave the house?
I don't have a phone.
Hey, hey!
I want him with me.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
When's school over?
The garage.
I love those doors.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
I was parked in day parking.
I need to talk to you.
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
Kurt's been feeding him.
Four days.  I left to think.
A blueprint spool.
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
He doesn't answer.
Where is he?
You let him pierce his nose?
You should lock your doors.
