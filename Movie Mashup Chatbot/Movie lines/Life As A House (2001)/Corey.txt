I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
