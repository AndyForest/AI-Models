With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
Dad's disappeared!
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
Marco!
When does George get to come see his house?
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
He's not there.
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
And video games after!
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
Sam!
We can work.
I wanna be with you today.
Are you going to see Sam again?
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
What color?
Who are you?
I don't think Dad wants you home.
I would have anyway.
Mom said I should.
