Red.
Do you guys feel like painting?
He hasn't called?
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Oh.
What's that for?
Floating to Catalina.
I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.
You'd hate him for the trick.
You hate your father.
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
Okay.  I guess.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
I'm not gay.
What are you talking about?
It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
What's the point of this?
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Why are you so stupid?
I don't want you to!
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
Really?
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
I can use your mom's.
No thanks.
Why?
Really?
Yeah.
No.  That's okay.
I might not stay, anyway.
I can't even take a shower here.
He's a freak.
He jumped into the ocean.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
Hey.
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
Is Alyssa here?
We're getting out of the ground today.
Thank you.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
Thanks for the shower.
Not a shower.
I'm sorry.
Uh huh.
Oh...okay.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Is Alyssa home?
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
I'll ask.
I don't know.
Here.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
You lied to me!
And you told Mom today?
I still don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I still don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
What's wrong with your back?
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
That's so weird...
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Do you ever wish you had done it?
I would have killed him.
Why wouldn't she leave?
Sun glasses?
Are you talking?
Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Getting high, I guess.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I'm telling you now.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
He's got nothing to do with me.
What do you know about me?
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
Nothing.
What I'm not.
How do you become something you're not?
I like how it feels not to feel.
I took some of your Vicodin.
Hi, Mom.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
Don't.  I don't want it.
I'm not even listening.
I'll have to pay him back.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
No.
You can't make me do a thing.
You're too fucking late.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
Did you got through my pants?
Where is it?
Oh, okay.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm leaving.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I'm not doing it!
No one would blame me if I left!
You're so predictable.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
Why?
I hate turkey.
No.
Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
What are you doing?!
Probably in the bible.
Are you totally insane?!
I'll hate you forever.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
Mom...please.
I'm not going!
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
I'm not going!
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
No I'm not!
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
Why would you be there?
To check up on me?
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
I wasn't sure.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
You got any weed?
Does Alyssa know?
No.
The payoff.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
Who?
Do you like red?
Either do you.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
No.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
This is what he wants.
Yeah.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
The door was open.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
What are you doing in my room?
