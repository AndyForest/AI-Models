Who are all these people?
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
I'm going to bed.
Uh...using Josh like that.
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
What are you doing up so early?
You'd better call and cancel.
And why was the alarm on?
What's wrong?
Mom?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
It's not what I was expecting.
My mother would die.
Did you feel anything?
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
What's that?
Monday.
Nope.
Is that legal?
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
No.
He seems lonely.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
What?
Where are you?!
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Not if what he left me was real.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
What?
Are you afraid of heights?
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
I thought I was helping you.
Not really.
I was wondering.
Josh said...
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Does everything have to have a point?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Why are you so uptight?
We're not gonna do anything.
I'm coming in.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
I'm okay.
Huh?
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Turn over.
I wanted him to marry her.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
I'll get your back.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
You look better without make-up.
Tell him I said "hi".
Where's your dad?
You should stay.
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Where to?
What are you doing here?
Hi.
No.
He won't leave my room.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He's got a standing invitation.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
Are you guys' friends?
It could have been a squirt gun.
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
This is such a street of whiners.
