Months.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Well, if it is, we have a problem.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
I hate to ask about a window.
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
Oh, yes.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
Mr. Stevens?
