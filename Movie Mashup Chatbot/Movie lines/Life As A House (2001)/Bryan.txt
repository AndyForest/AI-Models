Well, it's the least I can do.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
What can I do for you, George?
Well, I feel better about this now.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
Forty.
Oh.
That's too long.
Maybe that's too long.
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Right...she married...what was he?
How's your wife?
how much weight have you lost?
What are you on?
