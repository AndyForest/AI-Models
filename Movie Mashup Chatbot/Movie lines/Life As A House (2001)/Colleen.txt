Atonement.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
Has he eaten anything at all?
Why?  What do you mean?
I couldn't sleep last night.
Oh God, we don't want the police!
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
I couldn't get it to go down.
I put him to work.
Here, honey!
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
You're here early today.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
I want you both to stay.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
I didn't recognize you!
Sam?
She didn't really say.
She's out with a friend.
Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
And you thought they might be under her dress?
I did warn you.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
George, this is the third time.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
This has got to stop!
