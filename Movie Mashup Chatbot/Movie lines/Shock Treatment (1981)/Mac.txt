Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
We're the experts.
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
SOLD??!!
SPONSOR!!!
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Brad!
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
CRIMINAL
THAT MINIMAL
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU'RE NO GOOD
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
That's an extremely negative response.
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
What does he know about it?
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
