They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
So it seems.
Why Janet?
How did you come by this scenario?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
But they only think they're happy.
Of course.
This could be worse than the old series.
SIN-I-FUL
CRIMINAL
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
Our field.
I don't think he intends to go that far.
Our speciality.
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
She walks in beauty...
Isn't she lovely?
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
No.
