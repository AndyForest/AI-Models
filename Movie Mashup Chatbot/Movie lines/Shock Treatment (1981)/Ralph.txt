What?
What's cookin', Bert?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.

Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
You bet, Bert.
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
You too, Betty!
I'll leave you young things to it.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
