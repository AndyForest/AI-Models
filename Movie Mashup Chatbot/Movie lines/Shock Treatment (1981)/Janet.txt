When do I get to see Brad?
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
I've caught it once or twice.
I know, I know, it's just...
He needs help.
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
That's us.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Who?
What do you mean?
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
That doesn't make sense.
Could I do that later?
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Why?
Poor Brad.
What show?
It's...
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
I'm sorry, Officer.
I NEED SOME
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME

BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
BRAD!
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
. . .For his own good.
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Do you really think so?
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
I want to see Brad.
Me?
I'm...happy.
No...couldn't I do this later?
No!  He's never done that before.
