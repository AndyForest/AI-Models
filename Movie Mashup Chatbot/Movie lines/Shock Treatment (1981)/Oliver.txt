President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
In a little masquerade?
Care to indulge?
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Yes, Betty.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
...closed?
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
McKinley?...McKinley?
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
A free thinker.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
In a way...
