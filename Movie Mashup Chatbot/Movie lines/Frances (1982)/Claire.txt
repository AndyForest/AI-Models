I guess so, sir.
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
...acts. I'll relay your message.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
You know what I mean.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
