The speech? Real good.
I already have.
Your big speech?

I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
'Golden Boy.'
