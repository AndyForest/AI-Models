You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
What about your husband?
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Aren't you ever going back?
You sound as if you hate it.
Why?
Why... yes.
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
