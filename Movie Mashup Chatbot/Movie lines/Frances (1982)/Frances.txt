'Forgive'...? For What?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Putting on my armor.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
Thank you --
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
My clothes?
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Huh.
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
Thank you.
What?
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
I'm not!
I'm not!
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
What does Clifford say?
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
A rich actress.
Who?
You don't think I'm good enough?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What's up?
Oh.
Where's Clifford?
Hello, Harold.
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
Who is she?
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
GET OUT!
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
In my eyes, officer.
You want his name?
What night?
No?
Dick...
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dick, we need some time apart --
Showdown.
...Yes.
Fired?
Claire?
Who?
Sort of.
Thank you, Harry.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
...I see.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
...Don't you?
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
Thank you.
Really?
But I'll never win that.
Thank you, Ralph.
No. Never.
No.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Daddy!
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I know that, Dad, but --
...So what do you think?
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
Of course.
What do I do, Dad?
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --
It's already started, Dad... with me.
He's a socialist, then?
Is Kaminski a Communist?
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I didn't have much to do with it.
Thanks, Dad.
See you next weekend, Dad.
Oh, Kurt!
But, Kurt, I...
Kurt!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Fifteen.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Just one minute...
Why, you... you little bastard!
What is this?
What?
They'll mend.
...Not if I can help it.
No, I don't hate it.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Are you really serious? About acting?
Are you an actor?
I wouldn't miss it.
You can always come see it in London.
That would be okay.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
No, we're not.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Well... you're looking well.
How did I look?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Yeah. I don't know.
Oh Harry...
I love you, Harry. I love you.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Who?
I got your number, Mister Man.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
What's that?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
To quarter-horses.
What a man!
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
You can't drink.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
You know something, Harry?
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
...Take advantage of me.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
I should've known...
Where are we, mean man?
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Oh my God, I look awful.
Who said I was a lady?
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
No, Harry, I can't --
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
I took the early rounds.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
What's left of my blood.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
I know.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
The hell you will, Harry York.
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
No, they don't, do they?
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Forget it.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Well, the studio told me not to.
Yeah.
Harry... I met someone.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Jesus.
Oh no...
What?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
What?
Yeah.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
...So you think I should go.
What happened to him?
Quietly.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
How'd I look?
Well? What'd you think?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Harry.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Whattaya mean?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Okay then...
Don't touch me.
Shit!
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Yeah.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yes.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Fine!
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Who's writing this guy's lines?
What?
I live here.
What happened? Who're you?
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
You think I got it?
How's it sound?
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
'But how do I know you love me?'
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
But I want to. I'm trying!
I'm not!
That's me, Clifford.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
I will, I promise.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
I'm going out!
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
Mama, shut up!
No!
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
Haven't you heard what I said?
Mama...?
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
I'm back, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
Sure.
I'll be back.
Not long.
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
I think I need a little air.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Well, who have we here...?
Go on...
You kill me, Mama.
Then why did you bring them?
Why are these all opened?
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
You're taking me home!
Mama, what's...
It's okay.
I don't care.
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Yes, Ma.
Mama...
Oh bullshit.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Don't I know you?
Excuse me.
Symington says...
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
You what?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Oh for Christ's...
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
What?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
This whole thing is a joke!
...Did you really say that?
Normal. Average.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Oh! Are you really?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
It ain't for lack of trying.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
