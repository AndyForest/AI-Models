Are you... are you hungry?
Please, Francie...
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
Francie, you know I can't do that.
I love you too, Francie.
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...
Always. Always.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
Be careful, Francie.
...Then go.
And you think it's worth all this?
You really want to go?
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
I know.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
You wrote it, didn't you?
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
Bye, baby.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
See you next weekend?
I'm going back to the hotel.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Thank you.
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
