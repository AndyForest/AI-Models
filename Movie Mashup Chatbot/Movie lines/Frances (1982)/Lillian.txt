Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Good.
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
You're poisoning that child's mind.
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
Bread?
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
But what --
I have!
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Frances!
You're not going anywhere!
Where are you going?
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
Don't... talk crazy.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Say you promise.
At one. Promise?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
How long will you be?
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
What?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Smile, little sister, smile.
...You will.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
But they're using you!
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
