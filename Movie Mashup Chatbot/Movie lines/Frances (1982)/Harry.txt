All square, Doc.
I gotta go now.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Just a little way.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
No.
I'm not sure.
Why do you say that?
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
I hope so, Frances.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
I don't know.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Where to?
I love you too, Frances.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Frances! Frances!
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances, You're crazy.
You give up on her?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Will you marry me?
There's just one more thing.
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Huh?
No. To thoroughbreds.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
What's that?
I guess.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Huh?
Whattaya think you're in now?
That's right.
What?
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Evening, gorgeous.
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Take a walk, pal.
And?
You're coming.
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
Beats me.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
I'll bet.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
What for?
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Think I'll have a glass.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Frances...
Calm down, Frances.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Don't start, Farmer.
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
You're telling me.
Is that why you did it?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Serious, huh?
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Eight stories.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Kaminski.
Came to get a tan.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Frances...
You don't know what you want.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
What?
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
Enh.
I just wanted to see how you looked.
You think I'd miss it?
Harry.
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Yeah, well --
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
