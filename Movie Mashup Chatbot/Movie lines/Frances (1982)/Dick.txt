The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Without me.
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
There've been some calls.
You learn your lines?
