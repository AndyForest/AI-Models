We'll get you home, Frances.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
I know you believe that.
