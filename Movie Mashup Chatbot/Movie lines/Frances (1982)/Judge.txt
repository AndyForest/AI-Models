You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
Did you expect him to look you up?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
...Is that not true?
