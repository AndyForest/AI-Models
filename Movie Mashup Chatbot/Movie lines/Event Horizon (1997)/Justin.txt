I think I found something...
Holy shit...
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
That means top-secret, Cooper.
Ballast.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
From the Other Place...
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
The dark inside me.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
I'm going in.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
How do you know all this?
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
...I don't want to die...!
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Yes, sir!
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
