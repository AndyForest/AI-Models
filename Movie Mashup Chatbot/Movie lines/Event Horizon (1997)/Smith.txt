Roger that.
It's holding... She's holding...!
What about the accumulator...?
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
Where is it, where is it...
No, no, we just got her back together...
Come again, Skipper?
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Skipper...
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Captain, we got a problem.
Sir.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Understood.
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
Captain Miller, you copy?
But...
They're gone.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
We don't have time to fart.
We have a situation here...
Captain Miller...
It is now.  We're locked in.
Love to.
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
We've got some weather.
Yes, sir.
Something like that, yeah.
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
One-four degrees...
Heading three-three-four...
Jesus...
Locked and cocked.
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
What?
The safety circuit's failed!
What the hell is that?
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
Hey...
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
Get them back --
Explosive decompression.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
1000 meters...
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
You can't do that.
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
