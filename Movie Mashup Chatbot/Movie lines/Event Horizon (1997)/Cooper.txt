Justin?
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
...do you copy?
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
I can see why they sent you along.
I heard it.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
Will it work?
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
But Justin...
The containment, Second Containment...
We have a man down...
I'll be all over it.
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
From what?
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
Time to play Spam in the can.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
What?
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
I'm telling you, I saw it...
You weren't there. I saw it.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
Coffee.
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
What...?
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
Can you shut it down?
How? The Bridge is gone.
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
What's happening?
Is that an offer?
