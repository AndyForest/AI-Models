His peritoneum has ruptured...
90 over 50 and falling... .
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
What's happening...?
Nothing. It's nothing.
Starck!
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
What does?
What, Justin, what shows you?
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Justin.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Skipper...
Crystallized.
Frozen.
I found one.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
There's no one here, Skipper.
I can see the hatch.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Jesus its huge.
We've got pressure.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were...
I did.
There's no one here.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
He served on the Goliath.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
First time in a grav couch?
I don't care.
You got any coffee?
We have to do something, oh God...
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Do you know what it was?
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Can you shut it down?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
