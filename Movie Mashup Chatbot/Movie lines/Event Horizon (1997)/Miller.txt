It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
On my way.
I'll get him.
Hold on, Coop...
Coop, where are you...
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
Don't start with me, Cooper.
Oh God...
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Hear what?
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Go on.
What is it?
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
We'll make it.
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
How is he?
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
Justin. I won't let you die.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Justin.
Patch me through to him.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Start the countdown.
Thanks.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
That's a negative, Starck.
Do it.
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
...you okay?
Peters...
Can anybody hear me...
...how's the client?
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
Alive?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
What you got, Peters?
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Starck, you still showing those readings?
Peters is right, no one's here.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
What's the hold up?
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Starck... Cooper...
You're lying...!
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
What are you?
Then who the fuck are you?
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
What are you talking about?
Your eyes...
Son of a bitch!
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
Watch me.
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
It's done.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
We're leaving.
That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
The "Other Place," what is that...?
Where has it been for the past seven years?
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
You said this ship creates a gateway...
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
Do it.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
Explanation?
It's 2041...
What about it?
You have something, Dr. Weir?
Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
If it worked.
It's insane.
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
Negative.
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
I can see that, what're they for?
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
What does it say?
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Get out of there now!
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
Smith, get out of there...
What is it, Smith?
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
Now what?
Thank you.
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
That's enough!
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Starck, give me a read.
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Starck...
Where is it?
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Dr. Weir...!
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
What is that?
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
He's dead...
...repeat, we're armed...
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
No. I'll be right back.
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
I'm on my way, Starck.
Stay here! Don't stop working!
What?
What's going on in there, Starck?
I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Go ahead.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
What is it, Starck?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
No. It was someone else.
Do it. Dr. Weir...
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
What's causing the readings?
What about the life readings you picked up?
We can take the filters from the Clark...
Carbon dioxide?
How much oh-two do we have?
But you can breathe it.
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
Everybody okay?
Keep your eyes open.
Radiation interference?
Come around to three-three-four...
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Let's go.
Justin?
