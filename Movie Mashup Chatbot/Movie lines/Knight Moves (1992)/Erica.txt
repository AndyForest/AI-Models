Okay.  Nice meeting you.
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
I know he really likes you.
Do you like my dad?
Boys.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Uh huh.
Who's Kathy?
But you promised.
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
You ready?
Thanks, David.
What is it, dad?
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Okay.
That has nothing to do with it.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Congratulations, dad.
