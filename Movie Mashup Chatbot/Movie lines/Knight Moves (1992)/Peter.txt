The message!  I figured out--
What?
Get off me!
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
I'm positive.
I was at the beach.
Then let's narrow it down.
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
He's not talking about himself.
No, I need the original note.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
No.
What do you want?
No it wasn't.
How'd you get in here?
I wouldn't know.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
Maybe you should.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
Morpheus.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
No.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
What's that supposed to mean?
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
Casual.
What are you saying?
What kind of problem?
Yes.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
The pipes.
I know where you are.
No!  Wait!!
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
It's me you want.  Not her.
Please... wait.
Let me speak to my daughter.
Yes?
I've figured out the message.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
You sonofabitch!
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
They think that you and I are doing this together.
What word did you leave last night?
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Hello.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
You like to brag, don't you?
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
How?
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Then call them!
I'm just trying to play the game.
Just like who?
But you said you didn't know her.
Why her?
You know her?
Hello?
You're not going to tell me that.
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
Where is she?
What?
Why not?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
And -- what path is that?
Did you know her?
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
Just a second.  Hello?
I haven't got time for this.
Who is this?
What scars?
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
What is it?
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Of course not.
What's this?
Thanks.
It isn't Kathy.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
For what?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Nothing.
Has he gotten through to any?
Who told you that?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
What are you doing up?
My cheering section.
Did you send the car?
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
I went out.
Are we going to go through this again?
That's got to be it.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
Maybe I already have.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
Could Emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
That's it?
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
I got it from the tournament directory.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
No.
Mate in five.
Who says something's on my mind.
About what?
You have something you want to say?
I want to be the best I can.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Is it serious?
We got a problem?
It's a good play, but risky.
I suppose you have something in mind?
Then I'll transpose.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
Do we have a future?
It's over now.
I got lucky.
Are you going to come tonight?
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
You're right.  The killer told me.
Frank told me.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
Because I know what it says.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
Because she killed herself!!
But I do.
It's not that easy.
You don't understand.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
You really haven't seen my best side.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
Can I come in?
Right.  Here!  c-4.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
Where's the note?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
Exactly.  It's the key.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
Then why are you backing up?
What's wrong?
I thought you said the line was busy?
Did you call?
If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.
You.
Fine.
Call room service.
No.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
I just don't want to fight with you.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
What?  By attacking me?
What is this?
I'm not playing a game now.
What?
It was.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
She died in a car accident.
Alright.  What about me?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
Why?
Doesn't that scare you?
I know you didn't
I know it was bad.
Relax.
You're not?
Why?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
You mean like in the steam room?
I'm just curious.
Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?
Do you?
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
In a way.
I think it's interesting.
It wasn't intentional.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
She could be dead now.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
No you didn't.
What are you looking for?
Getting too hot in here for you?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
It is.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
When I was very young.
Yes.
Uh huh.
No.  I don't.
How come you don't stay with them?
Yes.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
I'm sure you are.
