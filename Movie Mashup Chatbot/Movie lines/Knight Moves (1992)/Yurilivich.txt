Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
I'm not nervous.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
