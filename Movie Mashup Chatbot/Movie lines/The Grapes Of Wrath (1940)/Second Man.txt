Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
