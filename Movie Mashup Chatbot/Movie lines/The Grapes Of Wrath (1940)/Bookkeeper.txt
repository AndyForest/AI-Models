Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box. No bruised fruit. Move along and go to work right away.
Can all of you work?
Kids?
Women?
How many men?
That's not your affair. Name.
Want to work?
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Two and a half cents.
House 25. Number's on the door.
