Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
