We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
Deputy sheriffs.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
I never asked you!
Yeah.
I didn't mean nothing.
You ain't got to get sore.
I stay in my own yard.
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Get to what?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Been doin' a job?
Oh!
Lookin' for a job?
Goin' far?
Can't you see that sticker?
