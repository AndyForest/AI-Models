Twenty days work, oh boy!
Ready, Pa?
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Will ya look at her!
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
But ain't no reason--
How 'bout you?
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Ready, Ma?
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
I'd come back--
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
She got to make it.
Gallon or two?
Fan-belt's shot.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
Maybe the road's out.
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Lots must a died, too.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Oh.
You bust outa jail, Tom?
I didn't see nothin'.
Short fella. Pale face.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
