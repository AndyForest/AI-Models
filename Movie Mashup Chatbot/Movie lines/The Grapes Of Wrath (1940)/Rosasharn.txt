But we can still do it, honey.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
No'm.
I like the tent better.
We gonna live here?
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
But will it--hurt the baby?
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
You do not see either!--not yet!
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
