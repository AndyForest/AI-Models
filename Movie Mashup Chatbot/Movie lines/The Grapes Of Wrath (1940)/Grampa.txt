Ain't a-goin', thas all...
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
Take her with you!
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
