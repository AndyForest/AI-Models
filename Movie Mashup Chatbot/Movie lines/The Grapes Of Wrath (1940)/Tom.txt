Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
Any gas?
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Naw. They paroled me.
Why, I guess so.
Two.
Two.
Four.
Joad.
Sure, but what is this?
Goodnight.
Crate fell on me.
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Why ain't they more like it?
Say, who runs this place?
You got dances too?
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
An' you say no cops?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Joad. Tom Joad.
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
I aim to.
I dunno. Payin' five now.
Thought you was in jail.
Casy! What you doin' here?
You're right!
I ain't gonna run.
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
Think she'll hold?
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
She's settlin'.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
No. They wasn't people to write.
They're all gone--or dead.
That's our place.
Just around that next bend.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
I been in the penitentiary for four years.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Have a little snort?
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Why, you're the preacher!
Yeah. On my way home now.
What's the matter? What's happened?
Sure do.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
That's where I get off.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Naw--not much!
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Yeah.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
How about a lift, mister?
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
You been acrost?
What you mean?
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
How 'bout Granma?
What's the matter, Grampa?
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
I'll walk back.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Sure. We aim to.
No plants.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
California.
Okay. I be back a little later.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Sure. Good-by.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
They know what--this fella looks like?
They killed Casy first.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
I ain't full.
Got any more, Ma?
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
What's that--detour?
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
When?
Was Granma bad?
Didn' you get no sleep?
Look, Ma!
Ma, you sick?
Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Yes'm, that was it.
That's right. And douse some in it.
Don't taste bad.
How about it, Ma?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Mad, Ma?
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
I'd a found you, Ma.
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
Won't they come out here?
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Well?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Are you crazy?
But who done it?
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
I know that! But *where* they gone?
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Give 'im a fryin' pan.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
Me an' you both.
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
Casy, won't you say a few words?
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
California, here we come!
Ain't no whisky, is they?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
How you get all this money?
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
We can pick anything.
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Morning.
Ain't gonna get outa han'.
Yes, sir.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
