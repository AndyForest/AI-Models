Got a warrant?
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
That cut you got?
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
*You* find out, I can't.
Government.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.

No cop can come in here without a warrant.
That's the way it is.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
How many of you?
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
