Game over, bitch!
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
Oh, yeah.
What?
Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.
Five million dollars?
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
I ain't scared of you.
What does that fucking mean?
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
What are you doing?
What?  What's okay?
Bullshit.
So what happens now?
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
Sounds like chickenshit --
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
No fucking way.
You can't --
What are you doing?
Just do your job.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
What are you doing?
Probably.
Yeah.
No shit.
Why?  What happened?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
What is this?
No.  No I'm not.
Uh, Fontella's
What?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Right.
Is there a problem?
How in the fuck do you know that?
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
What?
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
I'm on the scent.
