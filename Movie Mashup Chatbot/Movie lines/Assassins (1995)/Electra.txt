Oh, God.  I see it!
Was nice.
What?
Okay.
Right.
Shit.
What?
Martin.
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
That doesn't sound normal.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Uh-huh.
When did it start?
Were you attracted to me right away?
Is this becoming complicated?
Was she the only one?
Did you --
What happened to her?
Who was she?
It happened to you before?
Attraction is a complication?
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Why?
Are you attracted to me?
Am I attractive?
Can I ask you something?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Why?
What?
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
No?
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
Nobody ever sees me.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
I went into their room this afternoon.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
So?
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I think I got one today.
Do you have ulcers?
Ten years later, here you are again.
You didn't take it.
Was that it?
What did he want?
What happened?
Ten years ago.
I don't believe that.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
For Nicholai?
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
Except --
Sounds pretty well figured out.
We split the money?
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
That means you won't have a gun.
What?  What if he brings it with him?
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
Okay.  Then what?
But he won't shoot you right then?
Check.
Fine.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Cheap as shit.
Two way?
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Where did you learn it?
The beach?  It was nice.
Sorry.
Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
Really?
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
What do you think he's doing?
In Costa Blanca.
Do you think he's here?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
That sounds nice.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
What happens if you do?
Not even a stalemate?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Do you think about the game?
Oh.  What do you think about?
Why not?
What?
You were there?
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
About?
Hey, where are you?
Where is it?
Several.
You said you didn't trust it.
No.  Something honest.
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
That's fiction.
Did it ever bother you?
After that?
Are they usually like that?
Because I want to know.
Yes.
Tell me about the first time.
Then you went freelance?
They tried to kill you?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Why?
Why not?
The exotic women.
Ahhhh...
But you knew what they were training you for?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
You went from high school to the Agency?
Why not?
You were like a boy genius?
Jesus -- why?
How old were you?
The C.I.A.?
How did you get into the business?
Where you wanted to be?
Why?
He was killed.
Why didn't you finish this game?
It looks like white's game.
Had?
Better than playing with yourself.
With computers.
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
Why?
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
No.  Just Electra.
Yeah.
Electra.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
How?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Why?
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
I don't need the money.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Forget it!
And you want to use me to get him?
Why?
He wants to kill you?
Why?
So this is something between you and him?
Someone hired both of you?
Who is that other guy?
What does that mean?
An assassin?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Nikita?
You didn't know anything about me.
Okay.  How did you find me?
You want me to pump?
Now what?
Ten million --
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Bullshit.
Yeah?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Where are we going?
Um, five.
What?
A pleasure doing business with you.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I thought it was interesting --
I wasn't watching television.
