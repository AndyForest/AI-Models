Electra --
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
