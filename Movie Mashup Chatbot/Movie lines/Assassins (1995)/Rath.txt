Bain!
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
Why don't you tell me.
You would be.
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
That's right.
All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
I know you're going to jump.
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
Okay.
We go around once.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
Tachlinkov.
We both know what you were doing.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
How long have you been freelance?
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
Okay, don't.
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
You're right.  Talking too much again.
What?
I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Where you from?
So you're from around here?
What restaurant?
Where?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Take us there.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
A player?
You think this is a fucking joke?
Is this how it went, Nick?
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
I bet you fucking know!
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
Yes.
Last night --
Electra --
I'm taking off my mike.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
I waited another four minutes.
Four minutes.
Martin.
I'm not normal.
Why?
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Honestly?
No.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
She was taken.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Yes.
It can be.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Both.
Why?  I don't know.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm sure you will.
Because, I'll take it.
That's a ridiculous move.
What are you doing?
Did he explain how this happened?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
And you were drilling these holes...?
Why?
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
No.
Thank you.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Jesus, if someone had --
What?
How do you know they're not?
I didn't notice them.
They're worth less points.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
No.
Yes.  Here I am again.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
What did he say?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Yes.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Yes.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
I was.
I told you, he will.
What?
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
That's right.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
Then, we wait.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
I paid a lot for these.
Transmits and receives.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Thank you.
Taiwan.
How was the beach?
You should knock.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Okay.
Breakfast.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Yes.
Here?
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
No.
No.
Yes.
Work.  The things I need to get done.
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
No.
I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
That's where he'll be.
I don't know.
Nothing.
Thinking.
Mexico.
Good.
Do you have a passport?
I don't.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Did it ever bother James Bond?
They become complicated... messy.
No.  Just the first one.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
Why?
My first take?
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Because you are a women.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Women?  No... not really.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
No, they didn't.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
I was just different.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
More or less.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
I killed him.
He was... taken.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
It's not the same, is it?
Because I'm done.
No.
What do you want to know?
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
Just Electra?
Rath.  Robert Rath.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
Right.
We don't have a choice.
Yes.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
Because he is trying to retire me.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
Another contractor.
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
Until a minute ago.
'Them'?
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Turn off the engine.
Now you understand why I'm here.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Twenty large?  That's all?
I'm part of the game, just like you.
Yeah.
I work for the government.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Get on the expressway.
One hour per man.
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Thank you.
Yes.
Do you believe that?
Can you tell me about it?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Honesty.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
You're very good at this aren't you?
Why are you working today?
Would you like a drink?
I prefer it like this.
Yes.  Please come in.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why didn't you fade?
Can I ask you a question?
Some.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Go ahead.
And an R.C.
What are you thinking about?
Right.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Taken.
Average.
A dime.
It's a common question.
I hope not.
It's possible.
Why not?
Sure.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
I have all day.
American currency.
That's correct.
