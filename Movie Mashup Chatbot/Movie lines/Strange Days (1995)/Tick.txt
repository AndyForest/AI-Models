I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
Well... the guy's fucked up.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Sorry.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
