Yeah.  See you there.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Are we under arrest?
Yeah, right.  Fucked.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
That's the original.  There are no copies.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Uh unh.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
No, it's not.
You never told me.
No.  It didn't.
I guess.
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
I'm not going.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
Who's Strickland?
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
How long does it last?  Oh.
Why?
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Well, look at the plus side.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
Tell me.
You sure?
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Fire's out, isn't it?
This is bad.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Lenny, give them the tape.
Something in your car...
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
What is it?
Where we going?
Whatup Lenny?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Sure.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
That's where it gets a little strange.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
So the guy's not a sicko.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
But that doesn't add, does it.
It's not your fault.
No more, Lenny.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
So that gives you something.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
And gives it to you.
Are you sure it's real?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
What is it?
What's that?  Present from Faith?
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
Forget her.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
Jesus, Lenny.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
No, you're just trying to get off.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Get it.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
Are we having a bad night?
You will not live to see the morning.
What the fuck are you doing?
Fumitsu.
Define love.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Driving Mr. Lenny.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Sleaze to peddle.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
What is that?
Are you going to make me beg?
Just Lenny.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Take the tape to the cops.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
