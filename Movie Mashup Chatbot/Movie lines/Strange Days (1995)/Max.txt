And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
Naawww.
You got froggy on me a couple times.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
You bet.  Did you like it?
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
You just did.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Only way I could stand your ties.
I intend to.
Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
No.  Bad idea.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
Is he dead?
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
Top ten.
So've I.  Too much.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
Let's work it.
You alright?  Y'okay?
I'm on her.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen with you.  Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
That's not sayin' much.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
You really want that on your head?
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
