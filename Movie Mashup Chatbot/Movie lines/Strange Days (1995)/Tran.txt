Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
Maybe later.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
You're going down.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
About what?
I always do.
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
I already got everything I need from you.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
