I live for the moment.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Fuck you.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Leave him alone, Tran.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
My God.
Jesus.
You can't just... kill him.
What're you going to do?
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
What a nightmare.
You think Tran killed her?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
We should talk alone.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
What's going on?
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
Who did it?
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Damn right.
Maybe.
He has his uses too.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
You talked to Iris?  When?
You have to go.  I mean it.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
No, Lenny.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Cut it out, Tran.
Make me forget it, baby.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
