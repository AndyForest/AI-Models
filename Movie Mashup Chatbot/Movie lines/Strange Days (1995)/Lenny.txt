Just not the eyes.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
A star is born.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
No.  Mace is in this.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
Tell me.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Can't do it.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Tonight.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
I'm already hurting.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
Faith, call me, okay?
I just got to talk to you for one second.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
Forget it's there.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Watch and see.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
Step into my office.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
How did you hook up with Faith?
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
So there never was a death squad.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
I won't say anything.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Jesus!
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
Where's Faith?
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
What do you mean?
Okay... what about Strickland?
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
Jesus.
What stuff?
Whattya mean?
No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
He's been cooked-off
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Looks like she was holding out.
Faith OK?
W'sup, Max?
Why me?
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
But this is a bad one.
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
He records himself raping and killing her--
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Yeah.  No, not really.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
You should feel like shit.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Shutup a second!
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
Naw.  She won't call me.
You were lucky, Max.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Thanks, Max.
Least you can do.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
She never gave me a tape.
What clip?  What was it?
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Who was just here?
What?
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
What else you got?
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
So lay it off to somebody else.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
It's alright.  He means it.
Charm.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Your sex life?
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Strickland.
See you downtown.
Yeah.  We did.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
No.  Trust me.
Take it to him.
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
Alright.  We're going up.
You see Tran?
Got your ticket?
Mace... you're a girl.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
It was a tough call.
There's a plus side?
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
Those two guys were cops.
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Shit!
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
This tie doesn't go with blue!
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
Jesus, Mace!
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
How's Zander?
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
And what about the guy that was following me?
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
No it doesn't.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
Never really thought about it.
Is this great fabric or what?
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
Wants to share.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Black.  Jack.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
No idea.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
You'll see.
She's my destiny.
She still loves me.
Rams... that's football, right?
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
I thought we were friends.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
That would be no.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
In LA?  Are you crazy?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
Let's talk in the car.
Coming with you.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
What's his name?
Yeah, but that was for love.
Define illegal.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
