Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias!
What are you talking about!
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
These two holes are yours...
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
