Where?
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...

Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
Where's Elias come from?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Where's he from?
What?
Yeah. How 'bout you?
No!
Where's Lerner?
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
I'll go with you.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
You really think so... us?
And you, do you believe?
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
That's a nice way of putting it.
...beautiful night.

Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Who gives a shit!

Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
What are the heads?
