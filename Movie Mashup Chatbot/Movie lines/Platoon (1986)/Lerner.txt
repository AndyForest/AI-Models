I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
I didn't like it.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
