Aye, aye.
What are you doing?
Sure.
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Have you done something to your hair?
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Dickie?
