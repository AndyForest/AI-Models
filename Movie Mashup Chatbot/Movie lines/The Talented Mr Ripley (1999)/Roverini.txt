I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
You have, yes.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fianc�e?

31 people.
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
Does he stay with you here?
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
November 7th is my information.

What about Thomas Ripley?
Even your fianc�e...?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fianc�e.
Of course. What happened to your face?
No.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
Dickie Greenleaf?
