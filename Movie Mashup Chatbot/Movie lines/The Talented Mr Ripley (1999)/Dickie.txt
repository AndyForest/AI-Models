I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
He's drowning me!
Okay.
Yes please!
I hope it wasn't cheap.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Shut up.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
Marge, you like everybody.
You'd say if you mind?
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
Did you speak to my father?
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Uncanny!
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Is that good?
We?
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Sure. Any time.
What are you doing in Mongi?
What evening?
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
Tom, I don't love you.
I love Marge.
How?
Marge and I are getting married.
Oh God, I don't think so.
Really? To Italy?
So tell me.
So cool.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Ripley's plans.
That's good.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
What are you talking about?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
He's downstairs.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Shoes too?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Relax.
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
What does he say?
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
No!
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
Do you have any brothers?
Well we certainly know that's true.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
I know. I write like a child.
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
You're breaking my ribs!
You're breaking my ribs!
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
Sure. I love Venice.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
Good afternoon!
Bird!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
You like jazz!
Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
I'm never going back!
What?
Marge! You've got to hear this!
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
What? What's this?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Can you mix a martini?
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
That's funny.
Say again?
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Who's this?
Marge-maintenance.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Frederico!
