Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
What?
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
How?
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
What?
I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
Ha.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
Why?
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Esatto. I'm always planning.
I've got plans!
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
Is Freddie here?
I thought you'd missed the train.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
What club?
Freddie?
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
I didn't mean with you in it.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Copy out from here...
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
I played piano in a few places.
What?
And Rome.
I have to go to Venice.
Could we sail to Venice?
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
Your parents met her.
This is so good of you.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
I love jazz.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
I met him in New York.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Sure.
I'm intruding.
No, still here.
You know, a primer.
It's just an undercoat.
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Hardly.
You should watch that!
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
What about Christmas?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
I guess.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Who is it?
Hello?
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
I think it might hurt her to know.
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Yes it is.
I'm well, thank you.
Mr Greenleaf.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
I hope she never knows.
Okay.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Oh Marge.
What?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
It's all true.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I told you. He gave them to me.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
Marge? Where are you going?
Shut up! Shut up!
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
I can explain.
What?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
He's having an early night.
And you, sir? Any better?
Look at me what?
That's a terrific idea.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Hello Marge!
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Get on. I'll take you to him.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Dickie did it.
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Marge, when did you get here?
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
I think you're right.
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Hello Marge.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
What about Cortina?
So I'm learning.
Sure.
I'm fine.
My fiancï¿½e.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
It's superb.
That ring's so great. The green one.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
He's not a man, he's a god.
Bird. That's jazz.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone.
You know what -- I am.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
I've thought about you.
Of course. Aunt Joan.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
Hello Meredith.
Exactly. 10.30 --
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Let's go.
I'll take them both.
I know.
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Is Freddie in Rome?
How did you know that?
What?
Randall.
As in the...?
Emily.  Just kidding.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Excuse me?
You're such a liar...
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Peter, I... I...
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Was who Meredith?
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Nothing.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
I give up.
You try. You try talking to her.
It's okay.
I'm fine.
I'll fix some drinks.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
What did he say?
Tell him I have a fiancï¿½e, Dickie has a fiancï¿½e and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
No.
I've been backpacking.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
It's okay.
What rumour?
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
My God.
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
Ten thirty?
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
I can't later.
Thanks.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Ditto.
Tomorrow.
Absolutely.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
I have!
It is a little coarse, yes.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
Thank you.
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
31 people.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
No!
A few days ago.
I don't remember the exact date.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
What about Ripley?
Even her.
I really don't want to see anybody.
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
Postmortem?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Yes?
