What's funny?
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Where's Dickie's father?
I think we sort of found each other.
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
A ragione. A ragione.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Where have you been since then?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
...Tom is a mystery...
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
And don't forget. I have the key.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Why lie?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Was that Meredith?
How was it?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Hello. What are you up to?
What do you want to change about this moment?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Tom, are you okay?
Or I could come back.
Do you want me to stick around?
Are you okay?
Not guilty.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
No key, huh?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
He's already angry, I don't think --
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
He says so many fiancï¿½es.
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
That's good, isn't it?
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Not at all. Morning Tom.
We'll be there.
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
And tomorrow?
Will we see you later?
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
