Oh!
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
I'm late.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
You're mad, aren't you?
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
What?
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
God.
Oh-
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Oh, good. Okay.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Yeah.
Nothing at all?
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
God, it's so clean out here.
God.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
That's sick!
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
Thing?
What thing?
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
Oh! My God!
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
What... huh?
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Oh, darn it.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Holy cow!
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Yeah.
Yeah?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
It's for my complexion.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Two?
Yeah?
Oh. What?
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
It was just great!
Yeah.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
No.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
Oh.
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
Life. I said, "life."
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
Will it change my life?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
and I keep, you know, it's-
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
I'm home!
It's his name.
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
Who cares? Who cares?
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Well, what is your definition of following?
You followed me!
You followed me. I can't believe it!
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Were you always funny?
M'hm.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Oh, you have my body.
Let's just do it, all right?
U-huh.
No, I'm fine.
Uh-uh-why?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
What are you doing?
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
It relaxes me.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Yes, it is.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
How is it any different?
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
Mine.
You don't want me to live with you?
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
I have a tiny apartment.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Of course.
I dunno.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Yeah.
Do I love you?
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Ooooh!
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
No, I'm not.
You see, like you and I...
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
Oh! Italian, right?
Yeah.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
M'hm.
U-huh.
M'hm.
Yeah.
M'hm.
M'hm.
M'hm.
Yeah?
Yeah?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
H'm?
What? What?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
Yeah?
Here, you want some?
No.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No.  You're a wreck.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah?
H'm?
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
Oh.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
We can digest our-
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, all right.
Yeah.
Really?
What?
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
Yeah?
Really, do you think so, really?
No, I'm gonna quit!
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Yeah.
it's my first time.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
what I mean?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
I know.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
Fifteen years, huh?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Oh, I see, I see.
Why not?
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Neat, yeah.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Oh, yeah.
M'hm...
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
Fifteen years?
Oh, you see an analyst?
Okay.
You sure?
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well...
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, my grammy.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Don't be funny.
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Huh?
Oh, right.
Oh, you do?
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
All right.
Okay, that's good.
Okay.
Well, where is it? I-
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Wisconsin.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Me? Oh, downtown!
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
Oh, no, I have a car.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
He was creepy.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
All right. All right. All right.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Get him!
Oooh! Here! Here!
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
Alvy, I...
That movie makes me feel guilty.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Oh!
Stop it, Alvy!
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
The alarm clock.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
Well, stop listening to him.
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Two minutes, Alvy.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
I just have time to get the, uh-
You think so? Do you really?
No.
Yes, I do.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Oh, yes, yes.
We really had a good time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know. I don't know.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Oh.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Oh, gosh.
Oh.
Hey-
Yeah.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.

Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Well, hi!
Oh.
