You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?

Lyndon Johnson?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
We've been through this.
Alvy.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Portchnik.
Allison.
Do you feel all right?
Yes.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
It's okay.
Why not?
Yes.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Who are you?
