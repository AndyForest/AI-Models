Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
You don't want my autograph.
I need a large polo mallet!
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Tsch.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Well, why not?
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
Yeah? Allison what?
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
What do you mean, next?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
I thought just earplugs.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
The what?
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
You look very pretty.
Yeah.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Thanks, honey.
Remember that day?
This is the first book that I got you.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
I'm cool.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Yeah, this place is great.
Christ!
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my...
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
yes, we had, uh...
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
Remember, we had that thing.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Check it out.
Here's a real present.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Happy birthday.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
I don't know.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Oh, I had the radio on.
W-w-whatta you mean?
What?
Oh, Jesus, really?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
Okay, let me have this.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
Very big spider.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Is he in the bathroom?
Yeah, where is the spider?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Oooh.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
What?
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
What's- It's me, open up.
I'm following you and David, if you-
David! David! I can't believe this!
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
Will it change your wife?
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Whatta you mean? Me?
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Yeah?
Sinatra?
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
M'hm.
G-go on, I'm interested.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
M'm.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
David? You call your teacher David?
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Following is different. I was spying.
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
I didn't follow you!
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
You're so sure about it.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Are yuh?
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Really?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Oh, come, you don't need that.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Yeah, I know it's small.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Don't you think I do?
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
I know you've only known me a short while.
That's the key question.
You- Do you love me?
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
You are extremely sexy.
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Look at these guys.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Look, look at that guy.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
And blind people, crippled...
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
Those are the two categories...
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
big subject with me, yeah.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Hey?
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Good? I was-
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Yeah.
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
As Balzac said...
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
Okay. Yeah.
Okay?
And we'll digest our food better.
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Gimme a kiss.
Hey, listen, listen.
It's terrific.
Yeah!
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
No, so help me.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
think that's, uh-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Oh, thank you.
God bless.
Fifteen years, yeah.
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Uh, narcolepsy.
Well, who's Sadie?
Duane?
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Neat?
Oh, sorry.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Sylvia Plath.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
No, I got time.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
I'll see yuh.
Well... thank you again.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Your grammy!
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
And I love what you're wearin'.
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
You want your gear? Here you go.
You want your tennis stuff?
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Nice car.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
I'll getcha a piece.
For yuh.
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Uh, you're driving a-
Right!  Where?
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Oh - you're an actress.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Yeah.
So sorry.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
You-you play... very well.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Well, no... not just, not only.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Hey, that was last year.
Well, then, w-who was?
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Don't give it to me. Don't!
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
M'm.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
How can you possibly oversleep?
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
I did.
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
Jesus!
Bad?
Oh, you got a headache!
What-
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Don't get upset!
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Are you?
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I can think of another word.
Tsch, a few.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Man, that's great. That's just great.
Tell him.
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Oh, do yuh?
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
Probably on their first date, right?
I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
What are you depressed about?
Key word here is "indulgent."
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Yeah, I love it there.
Hey.
Trigger.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Mean?
Sixteen years ago.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
And... uh-
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
V.P.L.?
Where?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
M'hm.
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
I don't know, I mean, I-
Oh, Jesus.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Look, uh...
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Oh.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
I have some very good memories there.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
You'll total the whole car.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Forget it, Max.
Ah.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Stop calling me Max.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
