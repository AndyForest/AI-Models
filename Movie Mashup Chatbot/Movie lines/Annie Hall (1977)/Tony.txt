Charlie Chaplin.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
And here, you just-
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
There's a whole wing in this house.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
It was a wonderful set.
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
...of possibly working together.
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
