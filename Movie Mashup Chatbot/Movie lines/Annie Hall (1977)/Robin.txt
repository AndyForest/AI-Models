Where are you going?
Oswald and ghosts.
I have a headache.
My head is throbbing.
I can't.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Dammit! I was so close.
Oh, I'm sorry!
There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Here you are. There's people out there.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
Commentary.
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Why are you so hostile?
