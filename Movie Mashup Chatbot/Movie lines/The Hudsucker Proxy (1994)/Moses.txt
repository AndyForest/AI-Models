Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
