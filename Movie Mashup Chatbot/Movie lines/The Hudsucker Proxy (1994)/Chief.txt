Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
He grins wolfishly.
Watch it, Archer --
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
I can't print this!
