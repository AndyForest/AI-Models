Yes, sir.
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
Who to?
Father...
About - thirty-four seconds.
But you're my father -
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
His Excellency's car!
Here I am, Father...
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Is that all?
"My dear President"...
"My dear"...
"My"...
"My President"...
"My dear"...
"My dear President"...
Who to?
Here I am, Father.
