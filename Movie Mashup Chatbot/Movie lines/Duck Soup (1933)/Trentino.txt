It must be done right away.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
Was it -- swine?
Oh -- you mean... worm?
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
Bah!!
Yes.
You upstart!
You worm!
You swine!
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
$50?
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
For you, I would do anything...
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
I didn't come here to be insulted.
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
