The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
