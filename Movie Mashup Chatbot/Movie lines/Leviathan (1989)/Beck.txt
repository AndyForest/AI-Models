Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Was there such a thing?
They found this?
Yeah...right...
Why Sixpack?
And?
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
I'm not a doctor.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
What's wrong?
What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Be my guest.
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
Just get in yours!
I got hung up!  Try this!
That's an order!
Go on!
No.
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
Can you fix it?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
I thought they were your friends?
What has?
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
What?...
...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Doc eat already?
Stay calm!
DeJesus!  A readout!
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
How do you know it was Williams?
Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.  Any other suit problems she should know about?
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
I can't see them!
Where's Jones?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
We're on backup air.
What are you doing?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Shit!  He sent them all.
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
How's astronaut training?
That was a loud one wasn't it?
Why can't we pick up his signal?
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
I need more light on that, Four.
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
What?
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
No!
Shut up, all of you.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
All right...
What's wrong with it?
Something wrong, Cobb?
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
He's not at his station.
The internal monitors read normal.
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
What's your air reading?
Charge set?
No...she killed herself.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
Forty-eight hours!
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Do it.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
I know that.
Thank you, Martin.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
