Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
It shouldn't be a long delay.

Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...

Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
