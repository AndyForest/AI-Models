Your suit, Becky!
Where the hell've you been?
Fuck your orders!
No!
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
No way...
Jesus Christ...
Crunch...Implosion.
What dead one on the ship?
He did.
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
One of those chunks of Sixpack!  Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
It's got Hazy!
We're getting out of here just in time.
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Yes sir...
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
You let him get away!
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
So that's all you do?...
Listen to it for Christsake.
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
Under there?
How'd you do that?
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Twelve hours!
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
No fuckin' lie...
Like a leech.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
What are you going to do to him?
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
How far away is she?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
The air's stopped.
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
Oh man, that's just great...
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
DeJesus...It's got him.
I ought to smack your face!
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
Sixpack...
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
Let's hope it holds.
