Oh, God, she's out there...
It bit me!
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Excuse me, sir...
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
What about our quota?
Where's Doc?!
Itches like hell.
What was it?
What happened?
Bullshit.
You read Russian?
What the?...
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
What's going on?
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
What music?  There ain't no music.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
I'm going to kill it!
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
Who cares?
