It hit me!  Where are they?!
We made it!
Can't we fix it?
How much time does that give us?
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Maybe they already have.
They know, don't they?
The escape bubbles?
What can we do?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?

It needs blood?
What's wrong?
What on earth's the matter with you?
How is he?
Who were you talking to?
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
What is it?
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Clear for pickup.
Hardly.
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Right.
Your pocket?
