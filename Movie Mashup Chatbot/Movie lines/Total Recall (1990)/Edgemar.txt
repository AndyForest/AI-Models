It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
Swallow this.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
At Rekall.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
