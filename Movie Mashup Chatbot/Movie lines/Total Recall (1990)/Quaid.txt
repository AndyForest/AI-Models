What happened to number five?
Take me to the hotel.
And you get a kickback.
Why not?
What happened to them?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
The Last Resort.
What to the rebels want?
What was that?  An accident?
You got the job.
Where's yours?
What's wrong with this one?
How'd you find me?
Who are you?
What do you want?
May I use your pen?
Thank you.
Get it, please.
Definitely.
Thank you.
I am Quaid.
Do you expect me to believe you?
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Who is it this time--my mother?
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
So why am I still alive?
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
Fuck you.
Sleazy...and demure.
Brunette.
Hetero.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Eight years.
Two-headed monsters?
Nice to meet you.
What is it?
Suppose I do...then what?
You open it.
That's right.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Amazing.  Where are we?
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
I'm listening.
What do you want?
Melina!
C'mon!
You're Kuato, right?
I don't know.
What, aliens?
Yeah.
Where's Kuato?
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Relax, you'll live longer.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Harry, what the hell is this?
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
What are you, my father?
I did?
What trip?
Harry!
No shit...
Why not?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Yeah.
They sell fake memories.
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
Quit while you're ahead.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Drive!  DRIVE!!
How did I get in this taxi?!
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Bullshit.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
I suppose you're not here either.
Yeah.  Some of it was fun.
Clever girl.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
I'm honored.
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Bullshit.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
And falling in love?
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
The hell you're not.
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
They did!  But I killed them!
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
--I got a trip to Mars.
Let me finish!
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
Harry from work...He was the boss.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Some men just tried to kill me!
Bye.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
I'm late.
Lori, move.
All right, forget about it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
Just think about it.
Move to Mars.
Let's do it.
Lori...
You know I do.
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
But I'm always home by morning.
I don't know.
Nobody.
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Who?
Mmmm.....
Let me go!
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
Go on.
Secret agent...How much is that?
I'm not interested in that.
I give up.
No options.
All right.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Come on, don't bullshit me.
How real does it seem?
What's in the two week package?
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
That a problem?
Mars.
Nice to meet you.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
It's just up ahead.
Aliens built it.
The one in the mine!
The reactor.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
He's lying.
I don't need Kuato for that.
Like what?
What can I do?
I saw them.
Not bad, for a hooker.
Just wondering.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Now what?
So you dropped by to apologize?
I thought you didn't like me.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
Inside what?
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would I lie to you?
Forget I said wife.
She wasn't really my wife.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Not any more.
Hauser left me a note.
I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.
I don't remember you.
There's something I have to tell you...
I guess he didn't.
Blondes.
I love you.
What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!
...Who are you?
Wait!
I gave you?
