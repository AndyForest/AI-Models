Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Let me buy you a drink.
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
You went to Rekall, remember?
How was your trip to Mars?
Hey, Quaid!
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Well don't.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Oh, Rekall.
Rekall?
