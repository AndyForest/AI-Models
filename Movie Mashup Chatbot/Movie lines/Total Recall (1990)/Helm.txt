Look at this shit.
I've got a lock!  There!
He's not at ground level.
I've got a weak signal over there.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
What is it?
Level 2.  Galleria.
I've got Quaid.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Up to the right.
