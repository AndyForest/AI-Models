They found us!  Everybody out!
Shit!
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
You tell me.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
On his way.
Sit down.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
