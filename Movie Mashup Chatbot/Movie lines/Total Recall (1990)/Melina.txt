How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
But maybe you can change all that.
Shut up and drive!
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
What's wrong?
Enough for everybody to breathe?
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
You sure about this?
Aliens?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
People are dying, Quaid!!  Stop!!  We've got to get air!!
What reactor?!
Where are you going?!
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
You two-faced-bastard.
Oh, since when?
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
I used to model for 'em, why?
Jump!
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
I said get out!
Get out!
I'm not falling for it.
I think you better leave.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
This is too weird.
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
What are you talking about?
...What?
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I think it's still hungry.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
I love you.
