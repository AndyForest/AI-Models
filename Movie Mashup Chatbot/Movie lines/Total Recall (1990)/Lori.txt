Doug, don't!
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
I love you.
I'm here at Rekall.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
It's time you found out.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
Beats me.  I just work here.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Implanted.
It was implanted by the Agency.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
I'm not your wife.
Doug...
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Oh God, Doug.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
You went to those brain butchers?!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
What are you doing?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
Well...What do you say?
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
And you believe him?
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Do what?
Yeah, sweetheart?
...You mean it?
Let me go!
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Tell me!
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Who is she?
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
Is that better?
