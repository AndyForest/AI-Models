It's about goddamn time.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Yes, sir.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
But I thought...
He had help.  From our side, sir.
No, sir.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
Pull them out.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
HER!
There!  The woman!
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Any news of Quaid?
What the hell is this?
Come on!
Up!
Split up.  Find him.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Shit!
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
Where is he?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Are you saying she liked it?
I want that fucker dead.
Where?
