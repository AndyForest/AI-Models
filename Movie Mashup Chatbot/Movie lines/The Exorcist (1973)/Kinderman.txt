Thank you.
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Oh, she'd love it.
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
Please.
Never mind.
Oh, I see.
Groceries maybe? A package?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
May I ask...?
It's serious?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
Another one. Had your lunch?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Withering Heights.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Do you like films?
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
How's the girl?
I came to say goodbye.
I could have you deported, you know that?
Who?
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
It's possible. Possible however�
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church�you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Really?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Always.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
