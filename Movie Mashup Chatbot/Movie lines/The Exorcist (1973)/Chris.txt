What honey?
Hiding?
Well why are they tearing the building down?
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
Sure you won't change your mind?
I'm gonna miss you.
Storage.
What is it?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Yeah, well I guess you should've.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Didn't who tell me?
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
No kidding.
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
What's this?
Oh great, anything else?
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
Hi

You're a nice man.
Really? wow.
What's her name?
Of course. Have you got a pen?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Would you like some more coffee?
Want to ask him?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Not that I know of.
No. Not at all,
We still don't know.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
No, she was heavily sedated.
No thanks Karl.
What man?
What!
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?

Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.

Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Is it coming out Willie?
That's good.
How are you today?
Morning.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
So, what causes this?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Convulsion?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
She used those words?
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
You're kidding! Like what?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Never.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
And those lies she's been telling?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Depression?
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Why the math?
Is she gonna die?
Yes. He's already here.
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
She...killed Burke Dennings.
What's the difference?
No
In Europe.
Are you sure?
What do you drink?
Wanna drink.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
What else?
Like what?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Could you see her?
You could do it yourself...
But how?
Why, I don't understand?
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
Oh yeah, since when?
I didn't get you?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
You wouldn't.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
On what?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
He didn't mention?
About my daughter?
Did he tell you about my party?
Pretty close?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Where?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Please go away.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Honey it's to help you.
Oh my God!
Oh, honey.
What are you doing here?
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
People get tired.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?

Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Oh I bet he is.

Goodbye Father. I call you.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
Karras.
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
Oh, Christ.
So what's next?
So what's wrong with her?
