George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
I did not.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
What?
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
Try the closet.
Try the back bedroom.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
We're half a million off.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
George, good to see you, my brother.
Touche.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
George.
I need you to go to Miami.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
That's my George, always thinking.
I know.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
What's the matter, George?
Please, continue.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
But you must.  It's the only way.
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Allo?
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
What type of planes do you have?
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
Now do you see what I am saying?
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
No, my brother.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Ah, yes.  The murder.
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
No?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
