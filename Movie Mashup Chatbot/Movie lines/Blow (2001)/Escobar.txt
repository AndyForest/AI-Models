Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
I'm sorry, George.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
Diego?
George, you look terrible.
And Diego?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
Beautiful girls?
Family.
Power?
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let us drive.  We have much to talk about.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
