Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Why are you speaking?
The coca is my responsibility!
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
