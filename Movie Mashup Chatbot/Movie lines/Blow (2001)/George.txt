What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
Where do you guys want to count?
Um-hmm.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
Five-thousand per kilo.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
No honey, I'm alright.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
He what?
Motherfucker works fast.
What?
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check.
You wanna split?
Honey, your nose!
We'll take it.
Should we buy it?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Yeah.  I am.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
This is it for me.
Nothing like this back home.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Yeah.  I am.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
This is it for me.
Nothing like this back home.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
Excuse me?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Yes, I am.
Mirtha.
I see.  How much?
Excuse me?
You're a fucking amateur!
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
What?  Yeah, sure.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
For calling you a homo.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
I heard.
Yeah.  She told me.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
Sell it?
What did I tell you?
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
What the fuck is that?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
No.
We want some grass.
What the fuck is that?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
No.
We want some grass.
Get me a six pack.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
You fucked me, Diego.
No more brothers, Diego.
Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
Derek Foreal.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
This is not the time, Diego.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
I love you too, man.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Are you comfortable with this?
There's no room.
Where do I put this!?
I don't give a shit.  Close enough.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
I'm calling it three.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
Yeah.  You do the talking.
Just a friend.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
But to the victor belong the spoils.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Just sell it, Derek.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
Okay.
Good to see you, Diego.
I just got released five minutes ago.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
How are we doing?
Yeah, I'm out.
Diego?  It's George.
Diego Delgado, please?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Oh my G-d.
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Because they caught me?
Because I got caught.
I would if I could get some sleep.
Good night.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
What's the other one?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Twenty-six months.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
What kind of project?
What do you got there, Diego?
Murder.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Not really, no.
I don't want to talk about it.
What?
Today.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Coke.
Mom.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
It's a family heirloom.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Barbara.
Mexico.
Surprised to see me?
Yeah, layaway.
Well, you know.  It's um...
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
Yeah.
Yeah, well...
Diego is my brother.
Money.
Keep them coming.
Sure.
Yeah, maybe.
Freedom.
I want money.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
It's beautiful.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Yes, it is.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Yes.
Un sapo?
It would be my pleasure.
Actually, it was three.
I meant every word of it.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
Tell Mom, you know...
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Give this to Mom, will you?
No.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Hi.
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
Dad.
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
You mad at me?
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Just low.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
I'm going to California.
No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
I know.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
I'm going to California.
No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
I know.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
What about him?
What do you guys want?
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
George.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Figured what out?
George.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Figured what out?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Yeah.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
Yeah.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
What?
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Not in front of the kid.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
No, that's alright.
Where are you going?
Alright.
But this is...
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Put that shit away, they're here.
Jesus Christ.
I like fire.
What is your name?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Why are you smiling?
Do I know you?
Hello.
After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
I fucked up.
I didn't mean to...
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
I swear on your life.
I swear.  On my life.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
There's schools in California.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
I don't know.  Maybe California.
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
I'll be here.
California, huh?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
You can call me Dad if you want.
Dad.
How are you doing?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?
I don't know.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
Because she's visiting me.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
But I have a visitor.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Yes, I do.
I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out. Starting over.  Cheers.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Who's the co-pilot?
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Yes, I am.
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
That was it.  Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details.  My end was roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand.  Start over somewhere. One final score.  That's all I needed.
Holy shit, Dulli!
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Who speaks Spanish?
So, we need to get to the source.
It's not enough.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Stoned?
Right on.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
