I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Shhhh.
I know, Dad.  I know...
It's alright, Dad.
Swear on my life.
I don't believe you.
You swear?
But I've got school.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
You swear?
Where are you going?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
California.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
Yeah.
You mean, like a trip?
Do what you want, it's a free country.
What do you want from me?
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
What?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Well, here I am.  See?
What are you doing here?
Are we gonna split up?
What's happening to us?
