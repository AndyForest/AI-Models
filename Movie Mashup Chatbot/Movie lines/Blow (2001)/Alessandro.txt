On the plane.
Greetings, Mr. George.
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
