Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Oh, I see.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
G-d, son.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about that ring.  It's something else.  Let me tell you.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
