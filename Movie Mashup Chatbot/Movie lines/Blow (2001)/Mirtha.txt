Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Que va hacer?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Better than you.
George, he wasn't asking.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Kristina's fine.
Hey, George.  You okay?
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
What do you want?
Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
Out.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
I said, I've seen it before.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
She did that before.
Pablo said no?
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Why are you smiling?
I don't think so.
Hello.
