Are we good?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
So?
What?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Don't be such a pussy.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
That's right.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
