Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
That was out of line.
You?
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Nice doing business with you, George.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
I don't think so.
And I only deal with you?
Goodness.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
I don't know...
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
It's your grass.
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
What can I do for you guys?
