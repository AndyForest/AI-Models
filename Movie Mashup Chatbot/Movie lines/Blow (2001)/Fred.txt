Yeah.  Nice.
Who's the cheapskate?
Layaway shmayaway.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
That was a beautiful message.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
That's where you belong...
I'll tell her.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Good.
You're not going to trial?
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
You're like your mother.  You love money.
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Not mad.
Tough spot.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
What are you going to do?
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
