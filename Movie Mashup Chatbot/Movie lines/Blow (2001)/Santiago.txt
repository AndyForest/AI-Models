Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
For instance, something like this?
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
