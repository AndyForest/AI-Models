Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Mary ...
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
What about Kanita?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
I can't hold up my head anymore.
No!
Just take it easy.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
Sleeping in the back.
Mary said you might be coming.
