You're crazy.
Frank!
Frank!
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Let me think.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Why?
What do you want to break?
Who with?
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
Whadda we bring?
That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
Mr. Oh.
You okay?
The brakes are shot.
Whatja doing?
Where you going?
Look out!
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
