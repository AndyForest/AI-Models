Stomach again.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
You're in the stomach!
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
He's crazy.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Relax, will you.
Faster! God!
He's drunk.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
You're burned out.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
You know what. The radio.
Turn it off.
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Oh no!--I just remembered.
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
No shit.
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
