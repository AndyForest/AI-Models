Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
