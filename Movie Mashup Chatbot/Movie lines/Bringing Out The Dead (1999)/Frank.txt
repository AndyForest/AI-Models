What if there is no tomorrow?
No ...
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
You can trust me on this one.
She's having a baby. Twins.
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
Pregnant.
No.
Dead.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
You're going to live.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
Does that hurt?
I guess I'll be going.
Is this what you gave Mary?
I should be going. I just quit.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
Got a beer?
Mary, we really have to go.
I better just go in and see her.
She asked me to pick her up.
Where is she?
Frank Pierce.
The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Yeah?
No, I'd better not.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
You're not going to die.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
Frank.
There's no time.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
He'll be all right.
I need to sit down a minute.
Because you can barely walk.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Fifteen minutes.
You asked me not to come.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Maybe I should come up with you.
Okay.
Don't seem so bad to me.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Sure.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I think I'd remember that.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Five years.
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
He's better.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
How is she?
I think it looks good.
You look so different.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
She should go home.
He's working a double shift.
No.
Our Lady of Misery.
Yes.
Yes.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
At least he's got people around him.
You never know.
The first is always the best.
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
I guess there's always a chance.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
He's very very sick.
His heart's beating.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
Do you have any music?
I quit! I'm through!
Greatest job in the world.
I'll drink to that.
I hate vodka.
I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
Don't give me that look.
Backup?
Three legs.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
What's wrong.
I need a drink, that's all.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
She's no whore, Marcus.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
Thanks.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
I think the worst is over.
The ghosts--
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Where's Burke?
No.
Last show of the night.
A medical miracle.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
The family know?
What do you think?
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
He one of them?
He got better.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
Do it!
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
You learn that in the army?
That's ridiculous.
Okay, whatta I do?
He's crazy. He can't help it.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
Let's get in a fight, then.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
How's he doing?
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
Better bring it all.
It's early for him.
I never felt better in my life.
I've taken that into consideration.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
These are hard times, Tom.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
No way!
One more time!
You sure?
Used to be my partner.
You really think so?
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
Yeah, you're right.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Faster!
Well why didn't you say so?
They'll just keep calling.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
Mr. Oh.
Don't push it, Larry.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
What?
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
I'm not hungry.
What?
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
