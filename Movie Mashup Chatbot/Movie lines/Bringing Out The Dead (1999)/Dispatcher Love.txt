Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
