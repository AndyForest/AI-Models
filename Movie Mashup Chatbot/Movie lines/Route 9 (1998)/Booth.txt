I don't know what you're -
Dwayne listen to me -
I can't get enough of it.
Damn.
None of them had any --
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
Rock solid.
Uh huh.
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
It's too late...
What are you talking about?
Dwayne's dead.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
He killed her...
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
He killed her...he killed her...
Then Sally comes too.
We've got to go now, then.
We're not?  How do you figure that?
Then we're screwed.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
Maybe we should say somethin'.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
You killed him...
Here it is.
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
How long is it going to take?!
Not bad enough to kill him.
You're crazy.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
No.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
You said that last time!
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
And how do you figure we do that?
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
He would have done it to us, right?
That's not what I mean.
I can't do that.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
What are you thinking?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
It's the right thing to do.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
That's not what I mean.
I...I can't do that.
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
What are you thinking?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
He saw everything!
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
Shhh!
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
I've got one condition.
I don't know.
Torch it?!
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
At the expense of six people.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
What makes you so sure?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
It won't work.
Well someone's gonna find them.
We don't know that.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
No.  We can't.
Call it in I guess.  Why?
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Shit, more than that.
Ten thousand right here.
What the hell...
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
Never heard of it.
Cash and what?
Seven thousand...
I hear you.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Don't spend it all in one place.
Sure thing, and --
What are you doing, Earl?
Whoa, Earl!
Shut up, Jesse.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
No.  It's not.
Just take it in stride.
None of us like it!
What are you proposing?
Two thousand...
How much?
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
What's your offer, Jesse?
Why don't you get to the point.
Yeah?  So?
What's that?
You mean that guy was an agent?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
No.  Why?
How are ya?
Sally, do you love me?
I swear to you, it's true...
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Yeah, it is...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Why does that bother you?
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I love you Sally.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Great...
How the hell did he find it?
You're worth every last penny.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
And I'd take it out on him.
That son of a bitch.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
Nothing happened?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
You deserve it is the occasion.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
I love you too.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Yeah I'm fine.
OK.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing.
I know.
Yeah.
Hi.
I might have to look into that...
No.  But he would, probably.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
