Don't lie to me!!!!
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I want to get some hounds down here.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
What the hell happened here?
Sort of!
What do you think about all this?
This just might be our ticket!
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Did you say After Midnight?
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
Dwayne.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Have you known this all along?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Maybe I should come along.
Why would someone do that?
What are you getting at?
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
I guess we can get started.
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Lingerie...
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Is this marked money, or what?
A lot of men come in here?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
No I don't.  You sure you haven�t seen her?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Uh...C?
Oh.
Shopping here?
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Well I don't know...
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Well I just uh, you know...
Hi.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Something wrong, Jesse?
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
So be here at three.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Jesse?
She's not his type.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Take it or leave it.
Dammit you�re persistent.  I don�t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
All right you�re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Just goes to show you.
Calm down --
You'd do this to me!
You'd do this to me?!
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Watch that.  Watch that tone.
What are you saying?
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
Forget it.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Hey where's the hot pad?
What's this?
