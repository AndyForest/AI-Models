Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Yeah.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
I'm not getting an answer.
What do you think?  Heart attack?
You think he skipped town?
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
Not in the trunk.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
Money.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
