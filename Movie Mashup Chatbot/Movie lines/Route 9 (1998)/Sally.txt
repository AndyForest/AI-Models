You know I do.
I don't believe it.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
I don't know.  My friends...
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
I don't know, Booth.
How are we going to do all this?
A satellite dish?
I love you.
So do I.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
I know.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
He's not, he's...
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
I'm in here.
OK.  I love you.
Are you sure you're OK?
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
What's wrong?
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Heard you had quite a night.
Hi.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Has he?
He's irresponsible.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
What for?
Dwayne please calm down!
Dwayne -
Dwayne put the gun down --
It certainly is...
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
Whatever...
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
I didn't say that.  You did.
That hasn't stopped you before.
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
It was going to be a surprise!
I can't hear a word you're saying!
What?
I don't know...
