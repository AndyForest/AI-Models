OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
HELLLLLP!!!!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
I want my share. All of it.
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
By Friday.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
Well, I don't know...
I'm all ears.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
My offer?  Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends.  All I want is my share, which I guess is...
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
My point, well...
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Well I'm here now.
Yeah...see you at three.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
About what?
Why?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Yeah whaddya want?.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Sort of.
Aw, now that�s gonna take time to clear!
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I�m a busy man.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I�d have found it in a minute.
Damn it�s hot in here...
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won�t immediately look.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Don't hurt me.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
I think I am.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
So I want the money and I want it now.
I was on a roll!  I�m a little overextended now.
Listen -
I'm not asking.
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
Right behind you.
True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
I'll settle for a third of that.
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
