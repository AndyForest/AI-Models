That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
...yes.
Who -- who are you?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
