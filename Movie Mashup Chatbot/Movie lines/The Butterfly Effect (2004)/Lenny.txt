Destroy it?
What?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Gee, thanks friend.
Can... can... Can I have this?
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
