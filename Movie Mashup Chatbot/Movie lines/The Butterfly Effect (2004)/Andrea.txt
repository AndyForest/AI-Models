What?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
What is it?
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
No dances, just tell me.
So what did you find.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
How soon?...
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
But you must have something to go on?
And the bad news?
Why? What for?
Anything.
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Just. Like. Jason.
How. Did you. Know that?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Fix?
What does that mean for Evan?
Cute, Evan.
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
I don't know. These things take time.
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
Why do you ask?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Something must've happened! What set him off?
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Great. I'll see you soon.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
You know the answer to that.
Darn it!
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
