Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
There must be a way to fix this.
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
How long will I be in here?
What? What could he do?
Sure...
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Please, mom. People will talk.
I... I blacked out.
I don't know... I don't remember.
Okay.
I... I don't remember.
What happened?
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
My father has a bad memory, too?
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
No.
All the dads are gonna be there.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Can't he come out for one day?
Um... can dad come this time?
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
We're gonna be late again.
So you believe me?
What did you see? What did it look like?
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Can you protect me?
Photos?
But I... I need those books.
My journals! Where are they?
Where are my goddamn books?
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
It's coming... argh! I can't!
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
I see a car.
No, protecting her.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Yes.
Dad lives here?
You know my father?
Get out. Both of you.
Huh?
What?
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
Then you think it might have worked out?
And...?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
I don't get it.
I was?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
Stop! Take me back!
Where are we going?
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Which is?
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
I just thought you should know.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
Yeah?
Different? How?
Why's that?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
I get it. You can drop it now.
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
He's a fucking maniac!
What?
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
I walk differently?
Like how?
What do you mean?
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Go on. Sit down.
You'll see.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
So it didn't feel... weird?
I dunno.  Just being weird.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
Where... where are my clothes?
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
I know, but...
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
So how's Tommy?
Not since we were kids.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Duck, here they come.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
Damn. Your dad did this?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Been there, done that.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
What time is it?
Kayleigh? What happened?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
We'll find out soon enough.
Evan Treborn.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Hey, I got no choice.
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
It didn't feel like a dream.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Y... yes. I guess I did.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Lung cancer?
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
What the hell are you doing?
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
What's wrong with you?!
What happened?? Where are we?!
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Hey, what'd you do that for?
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
I come from a big family.
Huh?
