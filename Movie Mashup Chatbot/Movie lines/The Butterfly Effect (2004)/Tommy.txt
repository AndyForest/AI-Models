I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Listen to me good, Evan...
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
Look what you made me do!
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Lenny? Come on!
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
I thought I was the bad guy!
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Here you go, buddy.
You're such a retard!
