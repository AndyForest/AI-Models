What is she doing here?
Shit.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Yes, you doofus.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
Stu was with me last night.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Come on, let's rock.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
Shit, what is he doing here?
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
Come on, Sid.
Take a message.
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Just like old times, ain't it?
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Bye.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Later.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Or a man's mentality.
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Do you believe this shit?
What am I? The beer wench?
Tits -- see.
That's mature.
For once, Stu, drop it.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
I thought you dumped her for me.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
