FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Where the fuck did she go?
She can't get both of us.
I thought she was dead.
It's on the table.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
Ready?
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Duh... that's quick.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
How'd you do?
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
No one's saying you did.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
Hello?
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
It's okay. Give me the gun.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
You don't still think it was me?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
I called my dad.
What?
Are you serious?
What?
Sshh... it's okay.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Oh Sidney...
You lost your mom...
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
You have to move on, Sid.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
It's been a year since she died.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Hey, hey, it's just me.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
What's that?
I'm going... I'm going.
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
Close call.
I'll only stay a sec.
You sleep in THAT?
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
