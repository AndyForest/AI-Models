Please don't hurt him.
Where are you?
How do you know his name?
So you better leave.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
What do you want?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
Is this some kind of a joke?
Listen, asshole...
No-bored.
Dial someone else, okay?
What do you want?
Yes?
Gotta go.
Nah, I don't think so...
I have to go now.
That's not what you said.
What did you say?
Why do you want to know my name?
No.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Just some scary movie.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Uh-huh.
Popcorn.
I don't think so.
Who is this?
Hello.
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
What?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
So why did you dial it again?
Hello.
It happens. Take it easy.
I think you have the wrong number.
What number are you trying to reach?
Who are you trying to reach?
Yes.
