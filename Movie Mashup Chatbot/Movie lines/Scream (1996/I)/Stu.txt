I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
She looked dead. Still does.
No, it's not.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Yeah...
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
Nope.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
And if you get it right -- you die.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
Oh yeah.
Dude. What are you doing here?
You know it.
Oh...
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Sorry.
Owwww...
I didn't kill anybody.
Sorry.
What? She asked.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
I'll be right back.
Wanna another beer?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Like you had one.
He came to make up.
I can cry on cue.
I thought everything was checked out.
And what would be your motive?
Which is you...
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
She's saving herself for you.
So what's his reason?
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
The why'd the police let him go?
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
What?
You coming tonight?
Jesus, this place is packed.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
For about two seconds.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
The official term is "psychotic".
It's all part of the game.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
I did. He's full of shit.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I don't know, they just did.
