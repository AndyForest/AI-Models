I'll call for backup.
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
I don't think you're so bad.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
What brings you out to these parts?
Evening, ma'am.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
No, not yet.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
Hold up a sec...
Does mom know?
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
What are you doing here?
Not yet.
Afraid not.
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
You girls ready.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
You're sure it was the Hilton?
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
Yes, sir.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
You think he could still be in town?
Have you contacted the bureau?
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
She's tough.
Drive by patrol.
I was first to respond.
He's her boyfriend.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
