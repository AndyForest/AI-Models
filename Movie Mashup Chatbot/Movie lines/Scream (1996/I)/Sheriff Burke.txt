We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
You rode your bike out there?
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
She staying with you?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
What about the cellular phone bill?
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
How is she?
What were you doing out here?
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
How is everything?
