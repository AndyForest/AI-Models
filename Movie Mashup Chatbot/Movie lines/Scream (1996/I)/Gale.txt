I'll get my camera.
Sidney's father?
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
I like it. It's... sexy.
So is Dewey your real name?
Can I bring Kenny?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
What kind of lead?
Mind if I join you?
Then what are you doing here?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Deputy... good evening.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
And why is that? Has something happened?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
What's the delay?
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Many times.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
I owe you shit.
Forget it.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Just stay back.
I'll send you a copy.
It'll be out later this year.
Yes, that's right.
