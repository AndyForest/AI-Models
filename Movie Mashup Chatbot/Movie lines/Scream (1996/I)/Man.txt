Your call.
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
What door am I at?
Answer the question and I will.
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
Afraid not.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
Then answer the question. Same category.
But you're doing so well.
Now for the real question.
YES!
What's his name?
Come on, yes you do.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Turn off the light.
Which is it?
Then he dies. Right now.
I wanna play a game.
That all depends on you.
Guess.
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
I believe you...
I'm getting scared.
Sure...
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
Or else what?
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
They'd never make it in time.
More of a game, really.
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
You getting scared?
To talk.
I told you not to hang up on me.
Don't...
Don't hang up on me.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
What do you think I said?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
You never told me your name.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Guess.
You have to have a favorite.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Do you like scary movies?
Really? What?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
You're making popcorn?
What's that noise?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
I want to talk to you for a second.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
To apologize.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Do I?
I don't know.
What number is this?
Who is this?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
Hello Sidney.
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Uh-huh.
Right here.
That's the original part.
Your front porch.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Are you alone in the house?
And why is that?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
