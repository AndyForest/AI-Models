Ricki Lake.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
