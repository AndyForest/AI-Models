Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
Are you alone in the house?
Stop it!
I don't understand...
Why did you kill my mother?
Fuck you.
NO! Don't believe him.
I thought you were...
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
Uh-huh.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Who did you call?
Yeah... I think so.
You heard me.
Or even a good porno.
I wanna let go. I do...
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
So...
It's okay. We need to talk.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
No...
You know that's not true.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
Jesus, SHIT!
He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Oh Billy... Please... God...
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
You know what my dad will do to you?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
Oh it did?
Now that it's out of your system.
What are you doing here?
My dad's in the other room.
What are you doing here?
Billy? What the...
Should I be worried?
Have they found my father?
Yeah.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Any word on my Dad?
I don't know. I guess.
At the airport.
Did you reach my Dad?
...yeah...
I saw him leaving wearing it.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
Has his story changed?
Have you talked to Cotton?
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Do you still think he's innocent?
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
You owe my mother.
Please. You owe me.
Off the record. No cameras.
I want to talk to you.
I'm not here to fight.
I'll look for it.
How's the book?
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
Who are you?
LEAVEMEALONE!
Hello?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
What am I doing?
Can you see me right now?
So where are you?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
So where are you?
So who are you?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I have no idea.
Have a good trip.
Got it.
...out at the airport...
No you didn't.
Can you knock?
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
Don't come any closer.
Stop. Right there.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
You'll never get away with this.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Why are you doing this?
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Are you serious?
Why are they doing this?
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Deal.
TATUM!
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
No way.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
Who?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
Oh, god...
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
And you believe it?
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
So you think my mom was a slut too?
I don't know...
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
I bet he's pissed.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
It's alright. I'll get it.
He was there, Tatum.
No, nothing's like it used to be.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Whatever. Just hurry.
I'm not worried.
It's past seven.
Thanks, Tatum.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
How do you gut someone?
They think it's school-related?
Do they know who did it?
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
No way.
What happened?
