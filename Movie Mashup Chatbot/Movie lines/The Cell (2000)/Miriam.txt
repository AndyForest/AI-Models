...give a kiss to Edward.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
I know.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
Damn him.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
What happened?
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
She said convincingly.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
He needs to be turned over.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Nothing.
Sing a song of sixpence.
That's my girl.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Don't bring it home in this.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
Shush.
I don't want to find out.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
She adores you.
Lucien Baines?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Did we go sailing?
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Sing a song of sixpence...
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
What's wrong?
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
Intravenous administration complete.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
Completely unaware.
Awaiting his arrival.
That's a secret.
You're looking well.
Agent Novak.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
I doubt that.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
What about narcotics?
Any psychiatric medication?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Nervous?
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
Yes.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Catherine!
What about the legalities of this...?
When did he lapse into the coma?
