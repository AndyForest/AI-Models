No problem.
I got it.
I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
So you say.
Well look at that.
Yep.  Eloped.
You sure about this?
That went well.
COME ON!
Where the hell are we?
Little boy?!  That's him!
Like hell "wait."
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
Yes.  I am.
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
What difference does it make...?
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
Evil.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
You think you can do this, don't you?
What about Julia?
I did, yeah.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
What did you see?
That's what therapists are for, right?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Peter, okay?
Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
What then?
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
I know him.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
How hard could it be...?
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
There's always a chance they'll confess.
As far as I needed.
You're kidding me.
Delano?
That hoist, with the winch...
I need you to find something in the basement...
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
What about the cat?
How's the patient.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
Dr. Kent.
Is she alright?
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
No.
No.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Absolutely.
No.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
I'll get her...
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
Sometime yesterday morning.
It's his dog.
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
Now.
I need it.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Considering where I've been...
But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
Right here.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
I don't have to.
What else do we do?!
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
No.  Can you get a man close?
We proceed assuming she is.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
Here he is.
How is she?
