Give a kiss to Edward.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
I don't need them anymore...
What's wrong?
Baked in a pie.
...a pocketful of rye.
Is it cold in here?
No.  No.
I'll be fine.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
Why did we stop?
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Okay.
Yes mother.
No.
Okay, okay...
I'd be there for him.
I do it all the time!
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
Miriam...
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
He hates me.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
A pocketful of rye...
No.  Thank you.
Thank you.
They're hungry.
It doesn't matter...
He's mine?
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
Good for them.
I heard Julia and John got married.
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
I can't leave him!
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Wait...
Okay, okay...
You're sure of that?
Tell me.
What happened?
What happened to Charles Gish?
If you believe that.
Then what is he?
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
Why'd you bring him here?
A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
With Stargher I saw things...
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Agent Novak?
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Do you think that's funny?
You don't know the procedure.
I realize that...
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
I bet we can fix it.
Oh no... No you don't.
Who says?
What now?
He's beautiful...
