-- He's just a lucky guy.
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Go back to Bulgaria.
You want my advice?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
He always has.
And you want to know --
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Does he know that?
Yes, I'll bet.
So you decided to go to America.
How long have you been married?
I thought so. Where's your husband?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
I should have known.
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Yes?
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
-- Tonight he forgot.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Come up here a minute.
Goodnight.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
No thanks, Carl.
That's all right.
Here you are.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
Well, so long.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
And the carrying charges?
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Practically no one.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
Suppose we do.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
It's not for sale at any price.
It's not for sale.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
Because you're getting on that plane.
Everything is quite all right.
No, not yet.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
All except one. He won't have you.
And Laszlo?
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
When did you first find out he was alive?
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
And then?
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
No.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
How did you get in?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Has it got a wow finish?
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Especially tonight.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
Looking for a job.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
My German's a little rusty.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Uh huh.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
And I was wondering.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
He hasn't played it in a long time.
I will.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Not an easy day to forget.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
Here it is.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
You love her that much?
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Yes, I get the point.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
Had a close one, eh?
Well, this might come in handy.
I said, ask your wife.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
What of it?
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
My office.
Go ahead.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Good evening.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Any time.
Not at all.
We all try. You succeed.
Your work.
And I congratulate you.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
How do you do?
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Our expenses?
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
I have. Sit down over there.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Sam's piano.
I have the letters right here.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
You're late.
Oh, thanks.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Well, she isn't just any woman.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Yeah? Why?
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Oh, it's my party.
-- Thanks. I will.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Oh, how do you do?
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
He'll take one.
Why two?
Okay.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
His escape.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Victor Laszlo?
Yeah? What's his name?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Our entertainment is enough.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
What, again?
I was misinformed.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
It was a combination of all three.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
Hello, Louis.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Sacha, she's had enough.
I never make plans that far ahead.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Put it down!
Put that phone down!
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Are my eyes really brown?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
There seems to be no secret about that.
I'm a drunkard.
Make it official, if you like.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
I don't want them here overnight.
For how long?
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
No.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
-- You thought what?
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Hello Ugarte.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
What's that you're playing?
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Shut up and go home, will you?
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Then don't have a drink.
Good. Then have a drink.
No.
No.
Not right now.
Yeah?
Sorry.
He'll double what I pay you.
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
