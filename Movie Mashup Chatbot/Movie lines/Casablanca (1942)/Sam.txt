Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
Yes, boss.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
No, I don't.
Just a little something of my own.
Uh, my watch stopped.
Yeah, boss?
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No. Not me, boss.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
You ever going to bed?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Boss!
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
I like it fine here.
