Monsieur Rick, I --
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Oh, yes, please.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
-- Will he keep his word?
Yes, Monsieur.
Oh, yes.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
He did. Captain Renault did.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
No.
My husband is with me, too.
I came with Captain Renault.
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
Monsieur Rick?
