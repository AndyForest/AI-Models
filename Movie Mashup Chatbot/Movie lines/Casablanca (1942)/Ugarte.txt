Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Rick! Rick, help me!
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
