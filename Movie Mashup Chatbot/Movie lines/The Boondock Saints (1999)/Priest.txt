Forgive me father.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
You know them personally?
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
You feel?
You believe?
God's permission? God doesn't...
What is it my son?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Y-Yes my son.
Just go!
How long since your last confession, my son?
What do you want me to say?
God have mercy on my soul.
Have you no fear of God?
Don't do this my son.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Yes.
