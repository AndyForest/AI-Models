Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
They got nothing.

I know what the fuck he looks like!
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
C'mon!
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.

MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?

No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
You think they sold me out? No way.

Y'know it is, a bit.

Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.

He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.

Yeah boss?
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
