We're here brother.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Shit.
Look again for fuck sake!
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
What the fuck are you doing?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
Yeah, well...
Anybody see ya?
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
What happened?
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
You sound real remorseful.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Yes.
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Let's do him right here.
This is a six-shooter.
Where's your gun?
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
Yeah, we promise.
Well, I didn't but...
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
How's Uncle Sibeal?
No ma! No!
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
What?! What are you doin'?
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
Ma, what's wrong?
Mother, is that you?
Hello.
I'll call you tonight, afterwards.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
Our mother can see through bags.
We paid attention in school.
We... met them last night.
me up the...
Would someone please come over here and...
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
We're alive.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
We do not want your tired and sick.
Now, you will receive us.
He isn't to be touched.
And he is one smart man.
A-fuckin'-men!
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
Who did you kill?
Yes.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Yes, we are.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Aye.
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
A bit.
Is that right, Rambo?
I don't know they just always need it.
I'm serious.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Destroy all that which is evil...
Absolutely not.
Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Italian.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
Oh, Jesus.
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Shut it. It's Ma.
Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Hey Murphy?
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Yeah?
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Okay then... let's get ya started.
