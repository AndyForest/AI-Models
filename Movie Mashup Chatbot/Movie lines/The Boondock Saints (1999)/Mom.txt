Are ya ready?
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
What did you do, Connor?
Lord's name.
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
BLAME...
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Connor, is that you?
Promise me boys.
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
I...
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
