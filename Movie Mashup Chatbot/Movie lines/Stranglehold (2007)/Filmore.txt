I guess not Cooper...
Well Cooper...
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
You're talking about committing suicide!
What are you talking about?
Now what?
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
What happened?
Cooper...
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
What's that supposed to mean?
What do you mean?
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
What happened!
We don't have time!
What now?
What are we going to do!
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
Why? Are we going dancing?
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
I don't want any...
Shut up!
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Like where--in your dreams?
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
You're going to pay for this...
Go fuck yourself...
Are you going to kill us?
