I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Listen man, I don't need this shit--
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
