Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
Well Filmore--
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
Because I'll be firing at them.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
There's the fence...
Used to Filmore, used to.
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
Yeah?...
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
What do you think?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
Forget about it.
Let's move it we got company!
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
--be prepared.
We're outta here--
Who's got matches?
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
I said I'll lead.
I'll lead.
Where does it lead?
We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
How's the arm?
Good...
Are the labs in operation?
How well do you know this place?
Even better.
