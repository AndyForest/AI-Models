Oh!
Danny!
Danny, come here!
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Are you having a bad dream?
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Danny?
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Yes?
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
It's so pretty.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Danny, come on over here.
Jack...
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
Tony.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
But eh what was the matter with him?
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Please...
Shall we go into the living room?
Sound good to you, Danny?
No, we don't mind.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
I'm a Wendy.
Nice to meet you.
I'm gonna go now.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Go away.
Go away.
Go away from me.
Get down.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away!
Stop it!
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!
Stay away...!
Stay away from me,
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away from me!
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Of course I am.
Jack...
Yes...
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
I don't know.
I can't really remember.
I...
Jack!
Jack...
Yes.
Yes.
Somebody did that to him.
He's still asleep.
And you didn't see anything at all?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Did you find anything?
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
Any ideas yet?
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
It's about eleven thirty.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
Yeah.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Hi.
Thanks.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Oh, I'll say.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Oh!
Royalty?
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
