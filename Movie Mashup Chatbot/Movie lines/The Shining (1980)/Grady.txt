A nigger cook.
A nigger.

Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
That's right, sir.
Yes, sir.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
