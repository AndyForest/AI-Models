Yes, I'd like you to.
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Where does he go?
Why not?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Oh,
Is Tony one of your animals?
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
How did he manage to do that?
What sort of injury did he have?
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Thank you.
Yes.
