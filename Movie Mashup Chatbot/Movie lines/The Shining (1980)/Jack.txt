Good.
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Are you sure?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
What do you mean?
What?
Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Yes?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Yes.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Are you having a good time?
How's it going, Doc?
Come here for a minute, first.
They had to, in order to survive.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
Yes?
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Grady... oh.
She eh... interferes.
Well, he is a very willful boy.
How?
A nigger!
Who?
No.
And, er... where are they now?
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Delbert Grady.
Grady?
Fine.
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Advocaat is it?
Well, I'm looking for a change.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
Pleasure to meet you.
Bill, how do you do?
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
No charge?
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
Wendy...
Wendy...
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Give me the bat.
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Wendy give me the bat.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stop swinging the bat.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Wendy!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Why?
Why?
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Of course you are.
As soon as possible.
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
You can't remember.
How do you like it?
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Get him out of here?
I think he did it to himself.
Good.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Yes, I did.
No, nothing at all.
Which room was it?
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
What do you want me to do about it?
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Yeah... that's all it is.
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Hmm, nice.
I know it.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
What time is it?
Perfect for a child.
Sure is.
Uh...huh.
Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Hi, babe.
Well, it's very... homely.
I'd better collect my family first.
Right there.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Well, that is eh quite a story.
I don't believe they did.
I'm intrigued.
They'll love it.
Not for me.
five months of peace is just what I want.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh...
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Only in a very general way.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Mr. Ullman?
