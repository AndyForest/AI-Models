It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Your money's no good here.
What'll it be, sir?
It's good to see you.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
I hope it's nothing serious.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Thank you for saying so.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
What'll it be?
