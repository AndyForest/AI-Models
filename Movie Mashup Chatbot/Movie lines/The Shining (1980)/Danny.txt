You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Dad?
I guess so.
Do you like this hotel?
Dad?
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Do you feel bad?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Yes, Dad.
Okay.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
You mean they ate each other up?
What was the Donner party?
I'm hungry.
Dad?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
What about Room 237?
Is there something bad here?
Maybe he showed me something.
I don't know.
Yes.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Yes.

Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Do I have to?
