Well, I can see this is pointless...
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
You're getting defensive, Will.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
That's very presumptuous.
What?
I might understand that.
What places?
Like what, Will?
Will, your not getting off that easy.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
