Is that true?
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
Okay.
Is this a bad time?
I guess so.
This is your house, right?
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
Good.
Hi.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
Oh...
What class?
Okay.
Goodbye.
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
I never cared about that.
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Yes, I do, Will.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
What about your twelve brothers?
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Is that what you think--
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Then what are you afraid of?
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Why not?
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I don't know. I just feel it.
I know. I just do.
I want you to come with me.
Come with me to California.
Will? Are you awake?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
So, do you play the piano?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Just for fun?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Clearly.
It's important that I learn this.
No.
Fine.
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
When?
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
I think I can make it to South Boston.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
I've never seen your place.
Why do we always stay here?
No.
I'm supposed to understand this.
How the hell did you do that?
If you bring the caramels.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Where have you been?
I want to meet them.
Do you keep in touch with them?
Well...
Do you know all their names?
Your house must have been a zoo.
Bullshit.
Not a chance.
What, five?
How many?
Yeah.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
I bet you have a great family.
How was that?
You grew up around here?
Free?
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Oh, you will?
Yes you were.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
Okay...
Sure.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Sounds good, where are you now?
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Yeah?
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
What?
Okay, sounds good.
What?
Here's my number.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
You suck.
