He'll wait --
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Hello, Quince.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
And what would that be?
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
We're all ears.
We're all here, Bill --
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
