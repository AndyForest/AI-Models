Didn't you call a Board meeting?
The Board is waiting.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Nothing?
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
