Then don't.
Speak up, please.
Of course.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
You should hope quite a while.
You fill the bill, Bill.
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
That's me.
Yes.
'...Yes --'
I am not a dream.
But we've got time.
Y'didn't?
You said you liked me.
Why not?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
Did I say something wrong?
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
I would.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
'Her'.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
Why?
Nothing lasts.
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
