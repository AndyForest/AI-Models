Yes, Bill.  The question.
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.

I think you know --

It's enough now.
No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
