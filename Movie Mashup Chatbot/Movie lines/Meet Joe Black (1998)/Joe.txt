Toast?  No...just the butter.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
What are you eating.
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
No, I don't --
Perhaps you could remind me.
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
No.
Yes.
Then why did you bring it up?
Of whom?
What an odd pairing.
"Death and Taxes"?
Cold.
Why yes, thank you.
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
Thank you.
Here...
I didn't say.
We have an arrangement now.
Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.

She knows how she feel.

Yah.

Nuthin'.
No, I come to see Doctor.

Not time yet.
Can't, sistah.
Doctor lady make it irey.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
No, no.  I on holiday.
I from dat nex' place.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
No.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
What do you mean 'free'?
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
But she loves you?
How did you meet?
You love Allison, don't you?
Love.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
You're welcome.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
It's so very nice to see you again.
Black.
As long as it takes.
Are you?
Yes?
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
Thank you for loving me.
Susan --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
I'm still here.
I - uh --
The 'coffee shop' --
Did I say that?
I believe that, don't you?
'Love will find out the way'?
What will we do?
Will it?
But there's so much to tell you --
We know so little about each other --
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
Well -- I --
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
I love you in an evening gown.
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
Yes!
I loved it.
...No.
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
He's taking a nap.
How beautiful.
I am.
Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
Yes?
Why, yes.  Thank you.
-- Could you?
Thank you.
I love your smell.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
Almost.
You first.
Yes.  I'm tired.
To bed.
No.
No.
No, I'm not.
Why?
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Has her pain abated?
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Yes...I've found that it does.
Yes...
I don't know.
I mean I appreciate that.
I appreciate you --
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Be sorry for nothing.
Not now.
She's in a great deal of pain.
I don't mind --
And I'll be a visitor.
Whatever you do.
Very well, I'll watch.
I came to see you.
Oh goodness, no.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
Yes?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
Susan?
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
I don't have any.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Do you love Drew?
I haven't.
Peanut butter.
That is not my intention.
I am Joe.
'Big'?
I'm sorry.
I'm lost.
Yes.
Yes.
Not exactly.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
An indictable offense.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
And we're very grateful.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Okay.
Are you threatening me?
I don't like what you're saying.
No.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
Those were my words, Bill.
So that's what love is?
Which is what?
Then what is it?
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
I'm sorry, Bill --
I think you heard me, Bill.
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
I was just asking, Bill.
Not at all.
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
You are?
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Uh --
I told you, 'watch it'.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
This universe?
I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
'Spooning'?
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
I'll be the judge of that.
Yes, I saw you see me.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm not hungry.
'Fish'?
What's okay?
I'm sorry, Bill --
Goodnight.
Um -- not right now.
Hello, Bill.
Are you going to fire me, Bill?
You tell me, Bill.
I wouldn't put it that way.
I guess...
I don't know.
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
Okay.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
Absolutely.
This part I'm interested in.
Well...I don't know.
And more.
Uh-huh.
Truly - uh - splendid.
Excellent.  What is it?
Are you going to eat your lunch
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Oh.  Okay.
Of course.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Are you sad, Bill?
I don't understand.
Yes.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
No.
So can I.
Can you keep a secret?
What do you mean?
I understand.
That's what everybody says.
That's what everybody says.
Not this.
Make an exception?
Yes, Bill.
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
You've got a deal.
Bill --
A 'deal'?
Sounds fair enough.
And what?
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Good morning, Bill.
Good night to you, Bill.
Not at all.
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
I won't.
No.
What a good idea.
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
No.
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
'Threw' you?  Where?
Thank you.
No --
