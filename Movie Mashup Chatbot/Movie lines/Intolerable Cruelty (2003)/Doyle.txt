Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
You did good, Massey!
Baby. You are so HOT!
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Here. Got pictures.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
What part?
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
I had no idea until after, but --
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
After you, Doll.
