So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
-- and we are sure...
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
I just want to make sure that you both --
What a touching story.
No!
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
So she's uh, flourishing?
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Here's her picture...
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Excuse me?
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Marylin! What have I done?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
My God.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
You have the pre-nup?
Asian? No.
Thanks, buddy.
He's the wrong man.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
What?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
I should be in therapy.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
It was a gift from a client.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Why in God's name would I want...?
What the hell is Botox?
I don't need it.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
I thought so.
Pre-Castro.
Murder!
Income tax evasion?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
You wounded me first, Marylin.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Hello Marylin.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
You were going to have this thug...?
Wait! He works for YOU?
Marylin!
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Please! Leave the house.
No buts. Now. Out.
You have to leave the house immediately!
Marylin?
That's blackmail.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Meaning my house.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
You can't prove anything.
Those are gifts.
What kind of "stuff?"
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
What do you want?
I don't believe you have "things."
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
I bet.
Hello Marylin.
I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Good.  Are those foods?
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
But?
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
I have a watch.
I don't have a ring!
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
No.
You do?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
I want to be your -- your wife.
I want... I want to...
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
No.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
No, we're not!
Your mother was.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She never particularly cared for me.
Hmmm...
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
Me. Yes.
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Thank you.
No. Don't stop.
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Marylin? When did I say...?
Yes? Marylin?
Hello?
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
To victory.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
No, that's not all.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
But why him?
Marylin! Listen to me.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
To him? He's a sick freak.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
Oh, for the love of...
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
And you've always loved him?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Gotcha.
He wants a reconciliation.
No. I haven't. Have you?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
No.
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
Why would you be here?
But you don't agree?
What does your lawyer think?
Not yet.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Isn't everything?
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
How nice.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Excuse me?
Yes?
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Herb wants to see me?
Where does that leave us?
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
I don't have a pre-nup
Did Marylin end up with money?
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Heh heh.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
What?!
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
In anticipation of making you sick.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
I think that went as well as could be expected.
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
Nothing?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Ah.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Mm.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Now Rex.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Mr. Rexroth.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Do you have it?
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Wrigley?
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
She owes me a meal.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
HA!
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
What are they?
Is she going through with it?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Wrigley!
Video.
Nothing.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Who's "Patty."
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
