Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Hi, Sweetie.
Mother?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
