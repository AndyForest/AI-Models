We'd better go before we get thrown out.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Howard!
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Triple!
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
I'll be right back.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
I said yes.
It's about time.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
No.
Ruth Rabino.
Sweet.
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Murder?
Forgery? Fraud?
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
It's not something I wanted either.
Hello Miles.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
That's true.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
It's okay Joe.
It's a no go, Joe.
You do? You do love me?
I fell in love Miles.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Hello?
That's marriage.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
STUFF.  Got a light?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I want to nail you ass.
Comfy!
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
May I come in?
Miles? You're scaring me.
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
You don't like me?
I have a surprise for you.
Hi.
Miles.
Fabric and fringe.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Honey, I could sit...
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
Oh Miles!
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
I know.
Yes. Again.
Do you want to sleep on it?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Yes.
Did you just propose to me?
Huh?
What is it Miles?
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Friends?
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
We're damaged goods.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
And here I thought my mother was...
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
She held that against you?
She didn't love you?
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Is that you?
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
From a -- girlfriend.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Okay Miles.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Screw you, asswipe!
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Miles?
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Have you tried the duck?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Howard is a beautiful person.
So I hear. Is that all?
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
He's passionate.
Getting married.
Absolutely.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
He'll regret this.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Well, don't look at mine!
What is it you're after, Miles?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
You just haven't met the right person.
You don't believe in it.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
I know you do.
I told you. I was hungry.
How do you know?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Did you see the tape?
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
I assume this is on Rex?
These are yours.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Do you need a Tagamet?
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Hello, Rex.
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
We are. And it's winding down.
Rex. Get away from the door.
So. Now what?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Forgery and Fraud?
Please!
Jesus.
I was devastated. Of course.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
I guess.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Right.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
Is this Ming?
I want to be exposed.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Every week --
Lilly's up.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
Maybe.
Who's she?
Do you know him?
Miles Massey.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
She did a Harriman.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
