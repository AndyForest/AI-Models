Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
We rest, Your Honor.
Uh... poetry recitation.
Objection, your honor!
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
He was right, wasn't he?
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
You used his credit card.
Is this a lover?
Who's that?
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.

My client has ruled that out.
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
