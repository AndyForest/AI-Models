Don't touch him.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
This one?
This one?
No.
It makes me feel better.
What are you thinking about?
Right.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
What's the matter?
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
I'm here.
...I will.
...I will.
Good.
Does it hurt?
You love walks.
Hi baby.
Don't.
Don't touch him.
Me too.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Have they said anything about our area?
No.
How do they know it's over?
How many died?
They're broadcasting...
It's getting stronger.
I can feel air.
They're distracting us?
Merrill!
Merrill --
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
He was only a year and half old.
They're right behind the door.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
We have to go in the basement.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They already know we're here.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Ray Reddy's house.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
What time is it?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
What does it matter then?
Do you feel comforted?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Yes.
Morgan, be careful.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
Yes, it was.
Yes it was.
I cursed.
No I'm not.
Explain noises.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
I'm not going to curse.
Explain, act crazy?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
I can't even imagine.
You're scaring your sister.
Stop crying!
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
The family room.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
What's two?
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
I just asked his name.
Bimboo?
That means they're unemployed.
Who wrote this book?
Oh.
Morgan?
I'm getting out now.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
It's old Morgan.
I have some upstairs.
Edgar, come inside.
Yes.
What did you say?
Pinned? What does that mean?
Why not?
Is he okay?
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
And three weeks.
Six months.
No.
No.
I don't think so.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
I would say so.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
Sounds like a virus.
What was the first thing?
It's not broken.
What about them?
You said something was strange. What's strange?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Don't call me Father.
