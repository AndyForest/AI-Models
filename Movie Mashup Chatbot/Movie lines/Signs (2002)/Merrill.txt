Five. The five longest.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Clear for what?
I see.
You do?
Graham.
Graham.
That's good enough for me.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
I'm close.
Me too.
From what?
Got it!
I'm looking!
We won't be able to get out of there.
What are you doing?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
This is going to do nothing.
They're on the roof.
Should we turn off the lights?
Chicken Teriyaki.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Where are you going?
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
Yes.
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
How can you say that?
Do you think it's a possibility?
I got him.
That's right.
It's noise.
Pharmacy crowded?
That roof is over ten feet high.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
It was very dark.
It was very dark.
I heard.
You want him coming in the house next time?
Are you going to do this or what?
Just make noises then.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
Curse and stuff.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
What book!
Don't worry.
It's like War of the Worlds.
You'll lose the signal!
Yeah.
