Hey �� I'm over here.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ��
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -� He'll come up with something.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click � click � click.
No �- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -� turn off the lights ��
I thought they came right past here ��
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Thanks.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
That was a calamity!
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter �whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Why did you give up teaching?
What do you do now?
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
It's a lovely town �- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -� where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
I hated you that day �- you and your flip talk -� with that little girl lying dead.
We stood here once before.
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
We will ��
How do you know?
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways �
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
You. Us.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
And she waited here for him?
Yes. Do you mind?
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ��
Yes.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
I can use them.
And not a sign of the leopard?
Who is he?
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
It must be the altitude �� you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot�and�saddle boys --
And did you find the leopard?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft�soap twenty editors!
What did he have to do -� look at the body?
Who was the other man?
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Don't be soft.
Now look what you've done.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Clo-Clo?
No �� not yet.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
You're too good to me.
On his back, I suppose.
That's easy. Me.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Get it out of here!
No �- not yet.
You're too good to me.
On his back, I suppose.
That's easy. Me.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Get it out of here!
