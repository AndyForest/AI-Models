And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
I don't know.
I sleep it off.
I drink.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
It don't look like a leopard to me.
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head �- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ��
What's left of him.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
I want him to lock me up.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
I'm sick.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
Sure!
Sure, I like my leopards
Where's that man?
Sure.
They don't say it to me.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
