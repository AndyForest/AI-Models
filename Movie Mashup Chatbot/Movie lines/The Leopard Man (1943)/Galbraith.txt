Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
Then what do you do?
And when you drink, you get drunk.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths �� that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Good evening.
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
I couldn't rest �- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
It's better you don't know.
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
Not! I tell you. No!
No.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
To the eye? Like other men.
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
Just barely possible - - yes.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -� eh?
Yes, but what sort of a man?
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
Charlie likes his leopard.
About Charlie's leopard?
I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
Come to look around?
We're old friends.
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Sure -- certainly �- but what's that got to do with this?
Yes?
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
No. I'm quite sure.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Well, I'd best be off.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
Wait ��
They do, but -- there are no lights out there �- they'll just be shadows -�
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ��
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
That was unfortunate.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith � teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
To know where that leopard went - � I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh�water college back East. I gave that up.
