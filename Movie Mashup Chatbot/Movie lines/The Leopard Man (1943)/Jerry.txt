That's the place: I remember -� My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
What arroyo -� how did you get to it ��
Where? Where did you find it?
You found the leopard!
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
What do you want to see him for?
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
No. I'm serious about this.
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
Up at the museum.
Let's get in your truck.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
You really think so, Charlie?
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
Then you found the leopard --
Tormented -- ? Why?
Tell me.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
It was you.
It was you, Galbraith!
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ��  Don't you?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
Some other time.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
I don't know.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Some crazy guy.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
It could be a man.
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
Yes.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
More or less.
You know Charlie How-Come?
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Why?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
It doesn't jibe with this �� you told me the leopard would go out into the country �- it wouldn't stay in the city ��
Doc -- something you said the other day --
That's right, of course.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
It's about the leopard.
I want to ask you something.
Show business?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
That's a fact, isn't it?
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ��
I'm sure of it!
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
Yes. The lipstick.
State hunters?
No. He was kidding Charlie.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
Thanks, Sheriff.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
I know -- Teresa -�
Kiki?
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
What! You can't be --
I got into a little crap game.
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Absolutely sure.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
What else do you care about, Kicks?
That doesn't make sense.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
I know. Funerals.
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
��	As long as my feet held out.
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ��doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ��nobody on the streets at night ��
Yeah.
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
I don't know �� a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks � for the funeral expenses.
Are you all right?
You look swell in that three�alarm number --
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -� we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
I thought -� is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
And I never will- you know what's between us � we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ��walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
