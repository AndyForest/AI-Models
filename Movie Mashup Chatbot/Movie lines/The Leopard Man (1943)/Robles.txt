Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money ï¿½ not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Why?
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
What are you getting at?
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Go on foot.
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
